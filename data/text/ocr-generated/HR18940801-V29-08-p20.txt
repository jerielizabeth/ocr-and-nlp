zoo NOME CULTURE. " Excuse me, but they are so very young," mur-mured the friend ; and the subject was dropped. Another mother, this one with five children to look after, and living miles away from the one who has just been described, remarked when she was asked a series of questions similar to those which have been quoted, "I 'm so thankful to have them out of the way that I do n't trouble myself to find out where they are, so long as they come in for their meals at the proper hours, and in time to go to bed at night." This woman kept two servants, and was connected, as was also her husband, with a prominent church, living in one of the best houses of a small town, and was in every way highly connected. Considerable inquiry has developed the fact that a dangerously large proportion of well-to-do and re-spectable mothers share the feelings of the two who have been described. So long as a child of eight or  ten or over will keep out of the way and not " make any bother," it is all right. This is certainly laying a confidence in chance circumstances which would hardly be entertained even by an imbecile, regarding any other kind of property than children, if, for the purpose of comparison, they may be termed "prop-erty." So valuable, so easily soiled, so impossible to replace when ruined, and so difficult of repair ! One shudders to think of the risks which such mothers, thoughtless and careless to the verge of in-sanity, are daily taking. Know just where your children are, what they are doing, and what kind of companions are with them every hour of every day. It is the only way in which you can possibly discharge aright the sa-cred obligations of motherhood.ŠKate Upson Clark. SUMMER DRESS FOR A CHILD. OF all the good and comfortable garments which have been evolved through the Battle Creek Sanita-rium Dress System, certainly there is no one which will so commend itself to mothers and all having the care of young children as the one illustrated on this page,Šthe child's neglige dress. This dress is made CHILD'S NEGLIGE. on the plan of the neglige, or bishop's gown. It is one continuous piece of cloth, with shoulders and arm's eye fitted to the child, and a draw-string or rubber so arranged as to finish neck and sleeves with a frill. This makes a beautiful little dress, easily made and laundered, as the draw-strings can be let out, when there remains only a plain surface to iron. There are no buttons or button holes. Children from two years old and upward can wear these dresses for home gowns, and look as dainty as pictures. As may perhaps be seen, the possibilities of this little dress are many and various. In the matter of work alone, it is so simply made that it is a posi-tive boon to the mother whose workbasket is nearly always " running-over full " with children's garments which seem to be necessities. But surely economy in labor is on a par with economy in means, albeit much is said about the latter nowadays and but little in regard to the former. Mothers in general may possibly not be able quite to agree with a late writer who advocates the keeping of a young child literally " in its figure" during the heated term, yet all, either through the affections or through the humanities, must be interested in some degree in the question of comfort for children. A muslin gown made in this way will take the place of all other outside clothing, and leave the child free and comparatively cool these sweltering days. The fabric may he as thin as desired. How many times I have longed to strip off some of the ex-tra garments and folds of flannel under which I have
