GOOD .MMIN.r_Vrri. 253 \V  THE COOKING SCHOOL. F-ek  Conducted by MRS. E. E. KELLOGG. A DINNER OF EIGHT COURSES. PIES AND CAKE. So much has been said and written about the dietetic evils of these articles that the very names, cake and pie, have almost come to be regarded as synonymous with indigestion and dyspepsia. That they are a prolific cause of this dire malady cannot be denied, and it is doubt-less due to two reasons : first, because they are so generally compounded of ingredients which are in themselves unwholesome, and rendered doubly so by their combination; and, secondly, because tastes have become so perverted that an excess of these delicacies is consumed in prefer-ence to more simple and nutritious viands. We do not wish to be understood as being in sympathy with that class of people who main-tain that dyspepsia is a disciplinary means of grace, when, after having made the previous statement, we proceed to present our readers with recipes for preparing the very articles we have condemned. Pie and cake need not necessarily be utterly unwholesome articles, and, when prepared in a simple manner, may be partaken of in moderation by persons with good digestion, with quite as little detriment as many another article of food. Nevertheless, we shall not pretend to claim for them the whole-someness of more simple foods, and believe with a lady instructor in cooking, whom we met last year at Chautauqua, that if women would supply their families with perfectly light, sweet, nutritious bread and plenty of fruits, the contin-ual demand for cakes and pies would cease. However, if pies and cakes must needs be, let them be as simple in character as possible. We offer the following recipes as suggestions for ar-ticles of this class, which, while not to be recom-mended for dyspeptics, can scarcely be con-demned as unwholesome for persons with aver-age digestive ability:Š Paste for Pies.ŠSift together equal parts of Graham grits and white flour (Graham flour will do if the grits are not obtainable, but the grits will produce a more crisp and tender crust), and wet with very cold, thin sweet cream or rich milk. Have the cream and flour both as cold as possible,Šthe colder the material the more crisp the paste,Šand mix together very quickly and lightly into a stiff dough. Do not knead at all, but gather the fragments lightly together, roll out at once, fill and bake as quickly as pos-sible, since much of the lightness of the crust depends upon the dispatch with which the pie is gotten into the oven after the materials for the crust are thrown together. The filling should always be in readiness before beginning the prep-aration of the crust. If for any reason it is  necessary to defer the baking after the crust is made, place it at once in the ice chest till needed. Fruit Pies.ŠApples, peaches, and all small fruits and berries may be made into simple pies. The objectionable features of such pies are us-ually the rich crust, the excess of sugar used, and the addition of unwholesome spices and fla-vorings. For fruit pies, prepare a simple crust, fill with the fruit, using only just sufficient su-gar to sweeten the fruit, add no spices, and bake quickly. If any flavor other than that of the fruit is desired, let it be the flavor of some other fruit ; strong spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon, and all-spice, form a most unsuitable addition to delicately flavored fruits. For apple pies, a teaspoonful or two of pineapple juice, a little grated lemon or orange peel, or a little straw-berry or quince syrup may be used for flavoring. For pies made of apples, peaches, and fruits that are not very juicy, add a tablespoonful or so of water or fruit juice ; but for very juicy fruits and berries dredge the under crust with a table-spoonful of sugar and a little flour mixed to-gether, before filling. The heat necessary for baking will cause the flour and sugar, which will melt, to adhere together, and thus keep the fruit juice from coming in contact with the crust and saturating it. Granola Crust.ŠFor pies requiring an un-der crust only, the prepared granola manufact-ured by the Sanitarium Food Co. makes a supe-rior crust. To prepare, moisten with thin sweet cream or rich milk,Šone-half cup of cream for every two-thirds cup of granola is about the right proportion, and will make sufficient crust for one pie. Flour the board thickly, and lift the moistened granola on to it, spreading it as much as possible with the hands. Dredge flour over the top, and roll out gently, without turn-ing, to the required size. The material, being coarse and granular, will break apart easily, but may be as easily pressed together with the fin-gers. Change the position of the rolling pin often in order to shape the crust without mov-ing. 'When well rolled, carefully slip a stiff pa-per under the whole, first loosening from the board with a knife if necessary, and lift it gen-tly on to the pan. Press together any cracks formed, trim around the edges, fill, and bake at once. Use just the least flour possible in pre-paring this crust, and bake as soon as made, before the moisture has become absorbed. Orange Pie.ŠRub smooth a heaping table-spoonful of corn-starch in three tablespoonfuls of water; turn over it a cup of boiling water, and cook until clear, stirring frequently that no lumps be formed. Add one cupful of orange
