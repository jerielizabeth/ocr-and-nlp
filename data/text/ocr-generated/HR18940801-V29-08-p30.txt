HOUSE HEREDITY. NEARLY twenty years ago the writer was consulted by an elderly gentleman from Canada, who, in ex-plaining his case, remarked : " Doctor, I do not know what your opinion is respecting my case, but, my opinion is that I have inherited consumption from my wife. My wife died ten years ago from con-sumption and I have not been well since." Fortu-nately the poor man was not suffering from consump-tion, although he had a serious pulmonary disorder which gave occasion to a chronic and very trouble-some cough. The fact that he was suffering from a disease of the lungs, which, to his unscientific ob-servation, closely resembled the disease from which his wife had suffered and died, led him to think there must be some connection between his malady and that of his wife,Šand there might have been, although the relation would be more scientifically expressed by the term " contagion " than that of heredity, although, considering the ordinary use of the term " inherit" the application was not such a bad one after all. The poor man's wife had died of a lung disease, and after her death he found him-self suffering from what seemed to be a similar mal-ady, so it was very natural for him to suppose that it had been bequeathed to him by his dead com-panion. In a similar sense, houses may be said to inherit disorders of various sorts from their occupants. In this way houses become infected with tuberculosis. A case was recently reported in a French journal, in which several children died one after another, of a tubercular disease, without any apparent cause. An investigation showed that the house into which the family had recently moved had previously been occupied by a family, one member of which had died of consumption. The house had not been disinfected, and as the children spent most of their time in the room occupied by the invalid, there was every oppor-tunity for the operation of contagion. Another case recently reported illustrates the s--Ł vow  principle. A man living in a boarding house of the lower class, in Paris, after a lingering illness died of consumption. The bed which he occupied was taken by another man, who after a few weeks also became affected by the same disease and subsequently died. Investigaton showed that, in this case, the bed was infested with bedbugs, which had, by subsisting upon the dried sputa of the first patient, become infected with the disease, and, by biting the second had in-noculated him with the specific microbe of consump-tion, thus leading to the development of the disease in a general and acute form leading to a speedy death. Many similar instances might be reported. Some-times the morbid condition which exists in a house may be due, not immediately to the previous occu-pant, but to local conditions the existence of which may not be easily recognized, but would at once be-come apparent if one should take the trouble to investigate the pedigree or heredity of the house by inquiring after the health of its previous occupants. A remarkable instance illustrating this occurred in the writer's experience a dozen or more years ago. A gentleman who had recently moved into a fine, large brick residence called our attention to the fact that when moving into the house he had found written in large letters upon the walls of nearly every room, the words, " This is the malaria house. Look out fpr malaria," and similar expressions. Within five months the gentleman himself was stricken with ma-larial fever in a pernicious form, and died within a few days. As soon as the writer learned of the cir-cumstance referred to, which was not until after the begin,:ing of the patient's illness, he insisted at once upon moving the patient to another and more' salu-brious locality, but it was too late, as the mischiev-ous work of the disease had already proceeded so far as to produce irreparable damage to the brain. In the case last mentioned, the house, a large 74^ ( 250 )
