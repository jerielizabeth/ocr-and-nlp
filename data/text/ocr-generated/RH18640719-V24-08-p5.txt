FP 0 No. 8,1 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 61 power in the great apostasyŠthe great corrupter of faith and manners, the changer of God's times and laws, Dan. vii, 25, Rev. xiii, 1-10,Šit is said, "Here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." There is, in accordance with this prophecy, a peo- pie that are heeding and preaching this third angel's message, and they are distinguished from other pro- fessed believers in the advent at hand as command- ment-keepers. And it is not a mere nominal distinc- tion, for they do observe one commandment at least of God's great moral law, that the others are openly trampling under foot. It will be a people reformed from the corruptions of the apostasy, and from the manners of this corrupt and degenerate age, that will be ready for translation at the advent, and will say in that day, "Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us." Isa. xxv, 9. If you desire to find the people of God, look for those who have faith in prophecy, and not this alone, lint look for reformersŠreal reformers, reformers in practice as well as in profession and theory.

I mention this to show that we are having difficulties to overcome, and although we do not see immediate re- sults, as we have in the West, yet a good work is being done. Prejudice is giving way, and the way is open- ing before us. An earnest request is made for Bro. and Sr. White to visit Maine. Many join in this re- quest besides Sabbath-keepers. Hope they will come if possible. M. E. CORNELL. side the church. The brethren of that place are doing well, have almost completed an excellent house of wor-ship, and we trust are rising in the work. Our meeting at Waukon was a perfect success. We had a great turn out for that place, and an excellent interest. The brethren here are doing well, I think, and, as a church, are perfectly united. I hope they are going to see more prosperous days, and be a light by which many may yet see the way to salvation. From thence I went to Elgin, and held two meetings of deep interest, baptized three, and then went to West Union, where I preached to a good turn-out, though it was a very rainy evening. I shall continue on the tour till I visit the quarterly meetings south. I feel truly thankful to the Lord for the assistance afforded in the preaching of the Word, and for the sue-cess of his truth. B. F. SNOOK. The New England Mission. BRO, WHITE : Our tent was pitched in Canaan, Me., July 1st, for the purpose of holding a meeting over Sunday and Monday, the 8d and 4th. Elders Howard and Hanscom, both Advent preachers, had appointed a meeting to be held in Canaan at the same time, and we offered them the use of our tent, which they thank- fully accepted. Sunday morning, Eld. Howard gave a sound and in- teresting discourse on the subject of the atonement. The Lord backed up the word by the approving influ- ences of his Holy Spirit. We are happy to say that Bro. Howard gave the moral law its appropriate place in the atonement. In the afternoon, Eld. Hanscom gave a practical discourse, and in the evening Eld. Howard spoke on the signs of the times. Monday morning, preaching by Bro. Cornell, on the nature of man. In the afternoon, a discourse on the same subject, by Bro. Howard. In the evening, Bro. Cornell spoke with clearness and power on this government. The interest was intense, and a favorable impression was left on the minds of the people. At this meeting, prejudice was removed. We be- came acquainted with several Advent brethren and sisters, who rejoice in hope of the coming of Christ, and gave the people an opportunity to see that it is not necessary to quarrel with, denounce and condemn those who differ with us. If we think we have impor- tant truths that others have not got, we ought to show it by a great amount of Christian love and forbearance. If we see others in error, we must remember that we, too, have erred, and that he who styles himself, " The the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffer- ing, and abundant in goodness and truth," has borne with us, gently leading us step by step in the way of truth and duty. Let us imitate our merciful Creator in this respect. We can do this, and yet exalt the great truths that we love. We would have remained longer in Canaan if the lo- cality had been more favorable for holding evening meetings. From Canaan we came to Cornville, where we found an urgent request to hold tent-meetings at Kendall's Mills. Bro. and Sr. Cornell, and Bro. Gage left for Kendall's Mills, leaving me to spend the rest of the week with the brethren in Cornville. I had a very pleasant time in visiting the brethren and sisters, and spoke twice on the Sabbath, and once on Sunday. I tried to show the necessity of carrying out practically the truths of the third message. The brethren and sisters seemed to feast upon the truths spoken, and outsiders were interested. We were happy to form an acquaintance with Eld. Stratton. This brother loves the truth. His amiable and teachable turn of mind, and his good experience, qualify him to strengthen his brethren. May God bless this brother as he tries to feed the brethren and sisters in Cornville, and as he moves out with the sane- tifying truths of the third message. I came here on the cars this morning, and find the tent pitched, and a good interest started. D. T. Bouannan. Kendall's Mills, July 11, 1864. congregations are small, scarcely ever exceeding one  .  The Michigan Tent. BRO. WHITE : We are meeting with some success here. Some of the best, and most influential men of the place, are becoming interested, and starting in the truth. We feel encouraged to labor on, though our hundred. We begin to feel that our duty is nearly done here ; and we shall soon go to another place. We have sold about $23 worth of books. Our History of Sabbath, paper covers, are all gone but one. We shall send for more as soon as we ascertain where to pitch our tent next. The people here are poor, and provisions are scarce, and demand a high price. They say they would like to get our books, but do not feel able to purchase them. May the Lord bless them, and keep their hearts ever inclined to his truth, that they ma be sanctified in y obeying it, and at last find a home with the saints of God, in his everlasting kingdom. Pray for us, that the blessing of God may attend our labors, that they may not be in vain in the Lord. Yours in the truth. I. D. VAN HoRN. Ithaca, Mich. A Tree Cut flown with Bullets. --- A ROOT vivid idea of the awful storm of death that sometimes sweeps over the battle field, is given in the following instance of a large tree actually cut down by the continual stream of bullets hurled against it " 4  Most people,' says the Richmond Enquirer, ' have doubted the literal accuracy of the dispatch concern- ing the battle of Spottsylvania, which alleged that trees were cut down under the concentrated fire of minie balls. We doubted the literal fact ourselves, and would doubt it still, but for the indisputable testi- mony of Dr. Charles Macgill, an eye-witness of the battle. The tree stood in the rear of our breast-works, at a point upon which at one time the most murder-ous musketry fire that ever was heard of was directed, The tree fell inside our works, and injured several of our men. After the Battle, Dr. Macgill measured the trunk, and found it twenty-two inches through, and sixty-one inches in circumferences, actually hacked through by the awful avalanche of bullets packing against it. The foliage of the tree was trimmed away as effectually as though as an army of locusts had swarmed in its branches. A grasshopper could notLord, have lived through the pelting of' that leaden storm, and but for the fact that our troops were protected by breastworks, they would have been swept away to a man.' " Under date of July 11, Bro. Van Horn again writes : Our labors in this place are being successful. The Lord is working, and quite a number of the people are  not only becoming convinced, but convicted ; and are  beginning to live out the truth.  The whole community, for miles around, is being stirred up to investigation, and many are interested in the points of Bible truth presented at the tent. When we do not have meeting at the tent, by re-quest of friends we appoint meetings in their school districts, which are well attended, and we think will result in good. We have good reason to hope that the standard of  present truth will be represented by a company of commandment-keepers in this place. The prospects now are favorable. May the Lord still continue his work, and his blessing be with this people, in showing them the light of truth. Pray for us, that we may move in the order of the Lord. Yours in haste, I. IL V. H. Report from Bro. Cornell. WENT to Manchester, N. H., for the tent, and while there, held two or three meetings with the dear friends of truth. Their love for the truth is unabated. Bro. Wm. C. Gage, of Manchester, was willing to sacrifice his liberal salary in a printing office, leave friends and home, and share with us the labors and perplexities of a tent campaign. Bro. G. is now with us, acting as tent-master, and leading the singing. June 4th and 5th had three meetings in Palmyra, and three were baptized. While waiting for help to start the tent, attended the Advent quarterly meeting at Exeter, and became acquainted with many of the old '43 Adventists. Exeter has been a noted place for Advent camp-meetings for many years. I was invited to preach, and gave two discourses. The first on " evil angels," and second, on "good angels," When they  saw that I did not introduce a conflicting sentiment, prejudice gave way, and I was treated with Christian courtesy. By request, I gave three lectures in Corinna village, on Spiritualism, Stc. The interest was good. I was treated very kindly by Eld. I. Damman, by whose in- vitation I gave the lectures. Bro. and Sr. D. are op- posed to the Sabbath, and some other views we hold, but manifest a good degree of Christian charity. Though differing with us on several points, yet many have treated us with kindness. In this we have proof of honesty and sincerity, which, I trust, we appreciate. We find it quite difficult here to get from place to place, at this season of the year. Teams are scarce, and so many men have gone to the war, that what arc left are very busy. Tent operations here will be more expensive than usual. A brother could not get a horse tb-2 Note from Bro. Bates. BRO. WHITE: The church in Monterey is laboring for order, union, and fellowship one with the other. Sabbath July 2, was a good, quiet, peaceful, rest-day of the Lord. One more was baptized and added to the church. Yesterday, Sabbath, 9th, according to appointment, was the monthly meeting of the churches in Allegan Co. A goodly number of brethren and sisters from Monterey, Allegan and Watson, met with the church at Otsego, and enjoyed a refreshing from the presence of the Lord. The subject of the soon coming of our blessed Lord and Saviour was their soul-inspiring theme. Testimonies were sweet, cheering, melting and convincing. Two youth,, and a mother for her absent son, were prayed for by request. A number ex- pressed their joy for the good union meeting. Praise the Lord. ft Report from Bro. Snook. Š BRO. WHITE : I am still laboring all I can for the advancement of the good cause. Our quarterly meet- ing at Fairview was well attended by the brethren and sisters of neighboring churches, and we enjoyed a good refreshing time. At Laporte we had a good interest inside and out- Š
