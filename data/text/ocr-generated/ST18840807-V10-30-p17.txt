NUMBER 30.    HARVEST CALL. BY V. O. CROSS. OH, see how the fields of earth's harvest are whitening How great is the harvest ! but laborers are few. Why stand we here idle? the Master is calling, There is work in my vineyard for each one to do. From o'er sea and o'er land, from the South, from the North, Comes the loud cry for reapers to gather the grain; Armed with sickles of truth, let each one hasten forth, To diligent work through the hours that remain. For lo ! in the distance a storm is approaching; Already, we list to its muttering roar. Dark grows the horizon, fierce clouds are encroaching; Soon our work time is past, and the harvest is o'er. The 3arnest and faithful, the true and the tried, Overcome by their labors, are falling around; Who will fill up the ranks, and whatever betide, Ever earnest, and faithfully toiling, be found? There is work here for all,Šfor the young, and the old, Even children may share in this harvest of souls. For each saved one a star in their crowns of bright gold Will shine while the age of eternity rolls. Then how can we sit idly dreaming of pleasure, And seeking the joys and the treasures of earth? Let us hasten to lay up in heaven our treasure, And gain the true riches of heavenly worth. FOREIGN MISSION Ł MRS. E. G. WRITE. We are not, as a people, sufficiently aroused to the short time in which we have to work, and we do not understand the magnitude of the work for the time. The night soon cometh, in which no man can work. Satan is earnest, zealous, and persevering in his work. If he fails to accomp-lish his purpose the first time, he tries again. He will try other plans, and work with great perse-verance to bring in various temptations to ensnare souls. He never becomes so discouraged as to let souls entirely alone. If the zeal and persever-ance of Christ's followers in their efforts to save souls were equal to Satan's efforts to deceive them to their eternal loss, we should see hundreds em-bracing the truth where we now see one. God calls for men and women to qualify them-selves, by consecration to his will and earnest study of the Scriptures, to do his special work for these last days. He calls for men now who can work. As they engage in the work in sin-cerity and humility to do all they can, they will be obtaining a more thorough experience.' They will have a better knowledge of the truth and better know how to reach souls and help them .just where they need to be helped. Workmen are needed now, just now, to labor for God. The fields are already white for the harvest, and.yet laborers are few. There are those among us who could work if they were awake to the wants of the cause, and were willing to bear burdens. God calls for men and women, who are followers of Christ, to volunteer to work under his dicta-tion to rescue souls from ruin. . As a people, we have been asleep as to our duty in regard to getting the light before those of other nations.. .1s it because God has excused us, as a pople, from having any burden or spe-cial work to do for those of other tongues that there are no missionaries to-day in foreign coun We are not keeping pace with the opening providence of God. Jesus and angels are at work. This cause is onward, while we are standing still and being left in the rear. If we- would follow the opening providence of God, we' should be quick to discern every opening, and make the most of every advantage within our reach, to let the light extend and spread to other nations. God, in his providence, has sent men to our very doors and thrust them, as it were, into our 'arms, that they might learn the truth more perfectly, and be qualified to do a work we could not do in getting the liglitbeforeauen of other tongues. We have too often failed to discern 'God's hand, arid we have not received the very ones God had pro-vided /for us to work in union with, and act a part in sending the light to other nations. There has been a slothful neglect, and a crim-inal unbelief among us as a people which has kept us back from doing the work God has left us to do in letting our light shine forth to those of other nations. There is a fearfulness to ven-ture out and to run risks in this great work, fear-ing that the expenditure of means would not bring returns. What if means are used and yet we cannot see that souls have been saved by it? What if there is a dead loss of a portion of our means? Better work and keep at work than do nothing. You know not which shall prosper, this or that. Men will invest in patent rights and meet with heavy losses, and it is taken as a mat-ter of course. But in the work and cause of God, men are afraid to venture. Money seems to be a dead loss that does not bring immediate returns when invested in the work of saving souls. The very means that is now so sparingly invested in the cause of God, and that is selfishly retained will, in a little while, be cast with all idols to the moles and to the bats. Money will soon .depre-ciate in value very suddenly when the reality of eternal scenes opens to the senses of man. God will have men who will venture anything and everything to save souls. Those who will not move until they can see every step of the way clearly before them will not be of advantage at this time to forward the truth of God. There must be workers now who will push ahead in the dark as well as in the light, and who will hold up bravely under discouragements and disap- pointed hopes, and yet work on with faith, with tears and patient hope, sowing beside all waters, trusting the Lord to bring the increase. God calls for men of nerve, hope, faith, and endur-ance, to work to the point. If Christ saw that the souls of men were so precious that he could leave the royal courts and  humble himself to humanity, in order to help man in his' darkness, and to finally die for him, how ought we to feel for one another who have been made subjects of the grace of God, and partakers of this great salvation. I say to you, my brethren, in the fear of God, that we do not place a just estimate upon souls for whose re-demption Christ paid so great a price. Christ and angels are ready to work with our efforts, if we will work with love, simplicity, and faith. Our publications should be printed in differ-ent languages and sent to every civilized coun-try, at any cost. What is the value of money at this time, in comparison with the value of souls ? Every dollar of our means should be considered as the Lord's, not ours; and as a precious trust from God to us; not to be wasted for needless indulgences, but carefully used in the cause of God, in the work of saving men and women from ruin. The press is powerful for good or evil. This agency can reach and influence the public mind as no other means can. The press, controlled by men who are sanctified to God, can be a power indeed' for good in bringing men to a knowledge of the truth. The pen is a power in the hands of men who feel the truth burning upon the al-tar of their heal, and who have an intelligent zeal for God, balanced with sound judgment. The pen, dipped in the fountain of pure truth, can send the beams of light to dark corners of the earth, which will reflect its rays back, adding new power, and giving increased light to be scattered everywhere. Truth is what the people need. Fables are cheap, and can be found at hand any-where. The publications have already been doing a work upon some minds in other countries, in breaking down the walls of prejudice and super-stition. I was shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and a few pages,of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so wonderful and new to them and would open their Bibles with a deep and new interest, as subjects of truth that bad been dark to them were made plain, especially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth com-mandment. As they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone upon their understanding, for angels were hov-ering over them and impressing their minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading. I saw them holding papers and tracts in one hand, and the Bible in the other, while their cheeks were wet with tears, and bow-ing before God in earnest, humble prayer, to be guided into all truth,Šthe very thing he was doing for them before they called upon him. And when the truth was received in their hearts, and they saw the harmonious chain of truth, the Bible was to them a new book; they hugged it to their hearts with grateful joy, while their countenances were all aglow with happiness and holy joy. These were not satisfied with merely enjoying the light themselves, and they began to work for others. Some made great sacrifices for the truth's sake and to help those of the brethren who were in darkness. The way is thus prepar-ing to do a great work in the distribution of tracts and papers in other languages. tries ? Why is this negligence and delay ? There are those of superior minds in many other na-tions whom God is impressing with the lack of spirituality and genuine godliness in the Chris-tian denominations of the land. They cannot harmonize the life and character of professed Christians generally with the Bible standard. Many are praying for light and knowledge. They are not satisfied. God will answer their prayers through us, as a people, if we are not at such a distance from him that we cannot hear his voice, and so selfish that we do not wish to be disturbed in our ease and agreeable associa-tions.
