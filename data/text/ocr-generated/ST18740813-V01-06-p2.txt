42. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. Vol. 1, No. 6. would be the day of Pentecost. If the de-sign of God had been to honor the first day of the week, why did not the Holy Ghost de-scend on the first of those first-days ? Why must the day of Pentecost come before the Holy Ghost could descend ? This answer is obvious : It was not the design of Heaven to honor the first day of the week, but to mark the antitype of the feast of Pentecost. Hence the first day of the week is passed in silence. - The slaying of the paschal lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month had met its antitype in the death of the Lamb of God on that day. Ex. 12 ; John 19 ; 1 Cor. 5 : 7. The offering of the first-fruits on the sixteenth day of the first month had met its antitype in the resurrection of our Lord on that day, the first-fruits of them that slept. Lev. 23 ; 1 Cor. 15 : 20-23. It remained that the day of Pentecost, fifty days later, should also meet its antitype. Lev. 23 15-21. The fulfill-ment of that type is what the pen of inspira-tion has recorded in Acts 2 : 1, 2. God has Ł spoken nothing in this place respecting a change of his Sabbath. Yet grave men, call-ing themselves Doctors of Divinity, consider this text one of their strongest testimonies for their so-called Christian Sabbath. They might be profited by this advice of the wise man : " Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar." Prov. 30 : 6. FIFTH REASON. Paul once broke bread upon the first clay of the week at Troas. Hence this day was observed as the Christian Sab-bath. Acts 20 : 7. We answer that at one period the apostolic -church at Jerusalem broke bread every day. Acts 2 : 42-46. If a single instance of break-ing bread at Troas upon the first day of the week was quite sufficient to constitute it the Sabbath, would not the continued practice of the apostolic church at Jerusalem in breaking bread every day be amply sufficient to make every day a Sabbath ? Moreover, as the act Ł of the great Head of the church in breaking bread must be quite as important as that of his servant Paul, must not the day of the crucifixion be pre-eminently the Christian Sabbath, as Christ instituted and performed this ordinance on the evening with which that day commenced ? 1 Cor. 11 : 23-26. But on what day of the week did this act of Paul occur ? For, if it is of sufficient im-portance to make the day of its occurrence the future Sabbath of the church, the day is worth determining. The act of breaking bread was after midnight ; for Paul preached to the disciples until midnight, then healed Eutychus, and after this attended to breaking bread. Verses 7-11. If, as time is reckoned at the present day, the first day of the week terminated at midnight, then Paul's act of breaking bread was performed upon the sec-ond day of the. week, or Monday, which should henceforth be regarded as the Christian Sabbath, if breaking bread on a day makes it a Sabbath. But, if the Bible method of commencing the day, viz., from sunset, was followed, it would appear that the disciples came together at the close of the Sabbath for an evening meeting, as the apostle was to depart in the morning. If it was not an evening meeting, why did they have many lights there ? Paul preached unto them until midnight, and then broke bread with the disciples early in the morning of the first day of the week. Did this act constitute that day the Sabbath ? If so, then why did Paul, as soon as it was light, start on his long journey to Jeru- salem 7 If Paul believed that Sunday was the Christian Sabbath, why did he thus open-ly violate it ?. If he did not believe it had become the Sabbath, why should you? And why do you grasp, as evidence that the Sab- bath has been changed, a single instance in which an evening meeting was held on Sun- day, while you overlook the fact that it. was the custom of this same apostle to preach ev-ery Sabbath, not only to the Jews, but also 'to the Gentiles Acts 13 : 14, 42, 44 ; 16 : 13; 17 : 2 ; 18 : 4. Paul broke bread on the first day of the Week, and then immediately started on his long journey to Jerusalem. So that this, the strongest argument for the first day of the week, furnishes direct proof that Sunday is' not the Sabbath. SIXTH REASON. Paul commanded the church at Corinth to take up a public collection on the first day of the week ; therefore it follows that this must have been a day of public worship, and consequently is the Christian Sabbath. 1 Cor. 16 : 2. We answer, It is a remarkable fact that Paul enjoins exactly the reverse of a public collection. He does not say, Place your alms in the public treasury on the first day of the week ; but he says, " Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store." J. VT. Morton, in his " Vindication of the True Sabbath," pp. 51, 52, says :- " The apostle simply orders that each one of the Corinthian brethren should lay up at home some portion of his weekly gains on the first day of the week. The whole question turns upon the meaning of the expression, by him ; ' and I marvel greatly how you can imagine that it means ' in the collection-box of the congregation.' Greenfield, in his Lex-icon, translates the Greek term, by one's self, i. e., at home.' Two Latin versions, the Vul-gate and that of Castello, render it, vac/ se,' with one's self, at home. Three French translations, those of Martin, Osterwald, and De Sacy, chez soi,' at his own house, at home. The German of Luther, bei sick selbst,' by himself, at home. The Dutch, by hemsel-yen,' same as the German. The Italian of Diodati, appresso di se,' in his own presence, at home. The Spanish of Felipe Scio, en su casa,' in his own house. The Portuguese of Ferreira, ' para isso, with himself. The Swedish, nenr sig self,' near himself. I know not how much this list of authorities might be swelled ; for I have not examined one translation that differs from those quoted above." The text, therefore, does not prove that the Corinthian church was assembled for pub-lic worship on that day ; but, on the contra-ry, it does prove that each must be at his own home where he could examine his worldly affairs, and lay by himself in store as God had prospered him. If each one should thus, from week to week, collect his earnings, when the apostle should come, their bounty would be ready, and each would be able to present to him what he had gathered. So that, if the first-day Sabbath has no better foundation than the inference drawn from this text, it truly rests upon sliding sand. SEVENTH REASON. John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, which was the first day of the week. Rev. 1 : 10. This is the kind of reasoning which the ad-vocates of Sunday are invariably obliged to adopt. But we ask, What right have they to assume the very point which they ought to prove ? This text, it is true, furnishes di-rect proof that there is a day in the gospel dispensation which the 'Lord claims as his ; but is there one text in the Bible which testi-fies that the first day of the week is the Lord's day ? There is not one. Has God ever claimed that day as his ? Never. Has God ever claimed any day as his, and reserved it to himself? He has. "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God reated and made." Gen. 2 : 3. " To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord." Ex. 16 : 23. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20 : 10. " If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day," &c. Isa. 58 : 13. " There-fore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sab-bath." Mark 2 : 28. Then the seventh day is the day which God reserved to himself when he gave to man the other six Ł and this day he calls his holy day. This is the day which the New Testament declares the Son of man to be Lord of. Is there one testimony in the Scriptures that the Lord of the Sabbath .has put away his holy day and chosen another I Not one. Then that day which the Bible designates as the Lord's day is none other than the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Taking Hold of the Strength of the Lord. " LET him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me." Isa. 27 : 5. " I think," says one, "I can convey the meaning of this passage, so that every one may understand it, by what took place in my own family within these few days. One of my little children had committed a fault, for which I thought it my duty to chastise him. I called him to me, explained to him the evil of what he had done, and told him how grieved I was that I must punish him for it. He heard me in silence, and then rushed into my arms, and burst into tears. I could sooner have cut off my arm than have then struck him for his fault; he had taken hold of my strength, also he had made peace with me." What encouragement has the offend-ing yet repenting believer to take hold upon the strength of his Lord and his God! THE Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America, has four Bishops, fifteen annual conferences, 907 traveling preachers, 74,799 members, 535 Sunday schools, 1,102 teachers, 49,956 scholars, and is endeavoring to estab-lish a school for the enducation of its young ministers. Ministration of Angels. THEIR EXALTED CHARACTER AND SURPASSING GLORY. WHEN sin entered the world, God's glory was withdrawn, and a dark pall of gloom was spread over it ; God no more talked with man. We have only a few fading flowers, a few bright spots to remind us of the departed glory. Even the angels have but seldom been seen by mortals. The most lovely objects that we behold are marred with deformity, and tarnished with decay. Hence men, or-dinarily have but slight conceptions of the surpassing loveliness and glory of the heav-enly beings. A few times a rift has been made in the clouds through which some priv-ileged ones have been permitted to behold a few rays of the glory of Heaven. And then these have been so overwhelmed by it as to fear that they should die. Thus the prophet Isaiah, upon having a view of Heaven, ex-claims, "Woe is me ! for I am undone. * For mine eyes have seen the King, 'the Lord of hosts." Isa. 6 : 5. As Moses came down from the mount where he had been with the Lord for forty days, his face so shone with the reflected glory of God that the Israelites in fear ran from him. Ex. 34. How bright and glorious, then, must be the angels who dwell in the immediate pres-ence of the Almighty ! Some of the rays of this light and glory encircle them as they visit this world. Thus, when the angel came to Peter in the prison, it is said, " And, be-hold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison." Acts. 12 : 7. Of the angel who appeared at the tomb of our Saviour, it is said, " His countenance was like lightening, and his raiment white as snow." Matt. 28 : 3. And Daniel thus de-scribes the appearance of an angel who came to him : " Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz. His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude." Chap. 10 : 5, 6. Let the reader consider a moment what majesty and glory are here described. The most gorgeously appareled monarch would appear mean in comparison ! No wonder that Daniel says of the men who were with him that " a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves." Verse 7. So exceedingly glorious was the sight of the Angel who came to John upon Patmos, that the apostle fell down to worship him, supposing that it must be God himself. Rev. 22 : 8. From these facts we can form some conception of the exalted nature of the holy angels. Of the might and power of the angels the Bible also speaks in the strongest , terms. John says, " A mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill stone and cast it into the sea." Rev. 18 : 21. The Psalmist speaks of cer-tain ones as " angels that excel in strength." Ps. 103 : 20. When the angel came to raise up Christ, he made the earth to quake, and the soldiers fell like dead men before him. Matt. 28 : 1-4. Notice another interesting instance where their power was exhibited. In 2 Kings 19, we learn that Sennacherib, a mighty king of Assyria, came against Hezekiah, king of Ju-dah, with a powerful army, to capture Jeru- salem. Hezekiah was a good man. Not be- ing able to defend himself, he trusted in the God of Israel to deliver him. Sennacherib rid- iculed this idea, and boasted that the God of Iarael was not able to deliver Jerusalem out o his hands. The Lord heard this blasphemy, and determined to vindicate his authority. The Jews, being only a handful, seemingly would become an easy prey to the vast hosts of Sennacherib, numbering hundreds of thou- sands. But " it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred, four- score and five thousand ; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses." Verse 35. Here a single angel, commissioned from the court of Heav-en, slew one hundred and eighty-five thou- sand soldiers, defeated this mighty host, and saved Jerusalem ! Compare the deeds of the " heroes of earth " with this, and how puny they look ! see in the case where Daniel was cast into the lions' den. Those ferocious beasts became as harmless as lambs. The angel of the Lord was there. Dan. 6 : 22. Again, heavy man-acles fall off the bolted door, and the mas-sive iron gate flies open at the command of an angel, when a child of God is to be delivered. Acts 12. Thus we see that all the elements of nature, as well as the minds of men and the dispositions of animals, are subject to the control of angels. THE DIFFERENT ORDERS OF ANGELS. Wherever the handiwork of God is seen, we behold the most perfect order and har- mony. From the smallest blade of grass to the largest planet in the starry heavens, the most complete order is manifest. God is emphatically a God of order. It is an old and true proverb, that " Order is Heaven's first law." It is only where sin has left its foot-prints, where the trail of the old serpent is seen, and where wicked men rule, that we find disorder, confusion, and insubordination. That " Union is strength," is a self-evident truth, as well as an established maxim. This can only be secured by law and order. Then do not nature and reason teach us that the angels must be subject to law and order, and that there must be different orders among them, as there are in every society of men, in the army, &c. ? That this is the case the Bible seems to teach. Speaking of the com-ing of Christ, it says, " And the Armies which were in Heaven followed him upon white horses." Rev. 19 : 14. Here we see that Jesus, the great archangel .(Jude 9), the Son of God, who stands at the head, is the commander-in-chief of the angelic armies. The same fact is again expressed in Rev. 12 : 7: "And there was war in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the drag-on, and the dragon foughtand his angels." God has given to Michael (Christ) the command of all his armies. Thus Paul says, "Wherefore God also bath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name ; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in earth, and thingsiunder the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Phil. 2 : 9-11'. Now, if the angels are marshaled in armies (plural number, Rev. 19 : 14), and are subject to the orders of a chief commander, it is nec-essarily implied that there are also subordi-nate commanders, and captains of smaller divisions. We often read in the Bible, of cherubim, Eze. 10 : 1, of seraphim, Isa. 6 : 1-6, of dominions, of principalities, of pow-ers, &c., Col. 1 : 16 ; all of whom we conclude, are different orders of angels. When the soldiers came to take Jesus, he said to Peter, " Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?" Matt. 26 : 53. A legion was the division of an army, numbering three or four thousand. Jesus said that his Father would send him more than twelve legions of angels if he de-sired it. This indicates that angels are di-vided into companies. We may further sup-pose that each company is subject to its com-mander, and he to one higher, and the latter to one still higher, and so on, till we reach the commander-in-chief, the Son of God. Thus all things go on in union and order, and the entire universe of God, except the region of Satan's rebellion, is preserved in the most perfect harmony. THE ANGELS ARE MINISTERING SPIRITS TO THE CHILDREN OF GOD. An angel signifies a messenger. Judges 2 : 1, margin. " Angel. The original word, both in Hebrew and Greek, means messen-ger, and is so translated. Matt. 11 : 10." Union Bible Die. We learn from the Scrip-tures, that it is the office 'of the angels to oversee the works of God, epecially the cause of God in this earth, to watch over his children, administer to their wants, and defend them from their adversary, the devil. As there is an " innumerable company of angels," some of them are always before the throne of God to go at his command Says John,, " And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels around about the throne." Says David, "The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heav-ens, and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion ; bless the Lord, O my soul." Ps. 103 : 19-22. Here it is declared that God has his throne prepared in the heavens. The angels are represented as standing before him, ready to go at his pleas-ure as messengers to all parts of his domin-ion. We have here represented a scene similar to that which we would behold in the court The angels have also the control over the elements. Thus, when the king caused the furance to be heated intensely hot, and the three Hebrews to be cast into it, the angel of the Lord came and stood and' walked un-harmed in the midst of the fire ! Not only so, but he protected those men of God so that their garments were not even scorched ! Dan. 3 : 19-27. The angels can also control the disposition of even the wild beasts. This we
