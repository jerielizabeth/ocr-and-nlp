TRAINING SCHOOL. 247 4. work is most increased, should know how to shut up these germ-admitting avenues, and cut off the con-nection with disease-breeding germs from under the house.. A clean building site, a dry basement and cellar, perfect plumbing, and absence of pipe connec-tion with the sewers in all the living and sleeping rooms, as well as the stopping of all cracks in the floor, are important measures which no housewife can afford to neglect. Home nursing means providing the home with the necessary measures for maintaining the health of the inmates. It is a, mistake to consider the physician  and the nurse as only necessary evils, to be called in when sickness invades the family. They should be educators of the fathers and mothers, and instruct them in the best means of preventing disease. The ounce of prevention is what fathers and mothers should be able to apply; but without the knowledge of what it is and how it is to be used, the pound of cure will always need to be applied and always prove a failure and a broken reed, a 'delusion and a snare, to those who lean upon it for deliverance from the thraldom of disease and death. DANGERS OF DARK PLACES. 0 Ł THE psalmist describes the dark places of the earth as " full of the habitation of cruelty." In a more restricted sense the dark places of the modern home are as likely to be peopled with cruel inhabi-tants endangering the life and health of the family. Dark corners in the cellar, filled with Łdecaying fruit and vegetables, damp, musty, and moldy, offer just the soil for the successful culture of disease germs. These cruel inhabitants, which torture our loved ones with pain, and burn out the lives of the innocent chil-dren with fever, swarm from these dark underground places in myriads of deadly disease germs, which do their destructive work before their presence is sus-pected. Mothers who love your children and are anxious to protect your family from disease and save your-selves from the strain and wearing anxiety of sick-ness, look into those dark places. Disinfect them and keep them clean. Remember that the agents of disease and death, like all other criminals, lurk in dark places. Under the unused bed in the spare room, often hidden by an elegant valance, or covered by a costly coverlet of immaculate whiteness ; in the dark closets, where soiled, partially worn garments are  allowed to hang indefinitely, without either sunning or airing, which they require to keep them free from bad odors due to secretions of organic matter cling-ing to them ; in the dark corners of the pantry shelves or the creamery; under the sink or commode; in every nook and corner, screened from the eyes of the household by doors and darkness,Š there is dan-ger in all these places. Dirt is especially dangerous in dark, damp, unused, unaired places, shut away from nature's great disinfecting agents,Š sunlight and pure air. As the mother is the home defender, and spends so much of her time within its walls, she should pos-sess the knowledge and ability to successfully apply it in routing these inside foes of the family health. Soap and water to cleanse all the floors and wood-work, whitewash for the plastered walls, and above all, personal inspection and prompt removal of all forms of dirt, will keep these enemies off ; and it will pay, even if the front rooms have to go uncarpeted and unpolished, and the spare-room furniture be of the plainest, cheapest make. The best cure-all for any disease is prevention. CHEAP, COMFORTABLE SICK-ROBES. -Old night-dresses may be neatly mended, washed, and laid away for use in case of sickness. They are soft and easily washed, and much more comfortable to wear than new ones. When the shoulders and sleeves are too much worn to mend, cut them off, using two old long nightdresses to make one short one. The dress thus abbreviated is a much more comfortable garment, especially in fever cases and for helpless patients, every unneeded inch of cloth being in the way. I  once knew an old lady, somewhat.of an invalid, who begged all the old nightdresses and cast-off white garments of her lady friends, and converted them into bedgowns of all sizes. All the neighborhood knew where to go in case of illness for comfortable, clean garments. This grandma E's box was a bless-ing to him who was ready to perish. She was poor, but did what she could to make the world better while she lived. Others might well go and do like-wise. f Ł
