58 YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. ferencesT;;Liii;;;;;1;;;;tru;;the-wi;- Saviour,--___ I found enough to engage my whole time ____—____-----_ ter, particularly in New York city, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Early in the spring of this year, Elders Himes and Fitch held a confer-ence in Providence, R. I. Here for the first time I became acquainted with Bro. Fitch. His clear ex-position of the prophecies relative to the second coming of our Lord, were listened to with deep in- terest. In connection with Elder Himes, their preaching deeply affected the hearts of the people, and a great many professed strong faith in the near coming of the Lord. It was truly wonderful to learn how fast professed Christians could believe the evidences of the near coming of the Lord from the teaching of the Bible and history, and then disbelieve on no better au-thority than "a sneer," "a laugh," or "how do you know ? nobody knows anything about it," etc. Some of my brethren of the Washington-street Christian church, also began to wane in their Ad-vent faith, and would say to me sometimes at the close of our social meetings, " Bro. Bates, we wish you would not say so much about the second com-ing of Christ." " Why," said I, " don't you be-lieve it is as true now as it was when Bro. Miller preached it here last year, and you believed it ?" " Well, we believe Christ is coming, but no one knows when. Bro. Miller taught that it would be in about 1843. But we don't think so. We like to hear you exhort and pray, but we don't like to hear you say so much about the second coming of Christ, and the time." About this time the church elected a pastor, which was a source of deep trial to those who were more deeply interested in the Advent movement. Several of these interested ones sought and obtained their dismission. I continued in deep trial on this point for several weeks, hoping for some change for the better. I besought the Lord for light in this matter, and that which was granted me was to quiet-ly withdraw and be free. I did so, and notified the trustees of the meeting-house that I was ready to dispose of my interest to them which I held in the premises. They declined my offer, which left me at liberty to dispose of it publicly, which I did at quite a sacrifice. I was now relieved from about twelve years' responsibilities and care, in aiding to build up and sustain a free church, who took the Bible for their only rule of faith and practice. Four of us, members of the church, had united and built the meeting-house at a cost of over nine thousand dollars, nearly three-quarters of which belonged to us at the time I withdrew. Some of my good friends that were engaged in the temper-ance and abolition cause, came to know why I could ii  not attend their stated meetings as formerly, and argued that my belief in the coming of the Saviour should make me more ardent in endeavoring to sup- press these growing evils. My reply was, that in 46r GOD hears the heart without words, but he never hears words without the heart. embracing the doctrine of the second coming of the Ł in getting ready for such an event, and aiding oth-ers to do the same, and that all who embraced this doctrine would and must necessarily be advocates of temperance and the abolition of slavery; and those who opposed the doctrine a the second advent could not be very effective laborers in moral reform. And further, I could not see duty in leaving such a great work to labor single-handed as we had done, when so much more could be accomplished in work-ing at the fountain head, and make us every way right as we should be for the coming of the Lord. In May, 1842, a general conference was convened in Boston, Mass. At the opening of this meeting Brn. Charles Fitch and 'Apollos Hale, of Haverhill, presented the pictorial prophecies of Daniel and John, which they had painted on cloth, with the . prophetic numbers, showing their fulfillment. Bro. Fitch in explaining from his chart before the con-ference, said, while examirtg these prophecies he had thought if he could get out something of the kind as here presented it would simplify the subject and make it much easier for him to present to an audience. Here was more light in our pathway. These brethren had been doing what the Lord had shown Habbakuk in his vision 2468 years before, saying, " Write the vision and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time." Hab. ii, 2. After some discussion on the subject, it was voted unanimously to have three hundred similar to this one lithographed, which was soon accomplished. They were called " the '43 charts." This was a very important conference. A camp-meeting was now appointed to convene the last week in June, at East Kingston, N. H., where an immense multitude assembled to hear the good news and glad tidings of the coming of our blessed Lord. I had not the pleasure of attending this meeting, but heard most stirring reports of what was accomplished there. Camp-meetings and conferences were now being multiplied throughout the Middle and Northern States, and Canada, and the messengers were pro-claiming in the language of the message, " THE HOUR OF HIS JUDGMENT IS COME !" Monterey, Mich., July 14, 1862. Good for Evil. A YoutraŁman intending to drown his dog, rowed into the river, and threw him into the water. The poor creature tried to climb up the side of the boat, but his cruel master always pushed him back with the oars. In doing this, he fell himself into the water, and would have been drowned, had not his faithful dog laid hold, of him and kept him above water till assistance arrived, when his life was saved.
