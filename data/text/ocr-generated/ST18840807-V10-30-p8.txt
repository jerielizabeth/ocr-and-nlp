URIAH SMITH, - - CORRESPONDING EDITOR. OAKLAND, CAL., FIFTH-DAY, AUGUST 7, 1884. The Bible Rejected. THE tendency of the age is not flattering to those who are looking for the conversion of the world, or who claim that the world is growing better. A spirit of lawlessness largely prevails; and this seems to pervade all classes, not even excepting members of churches. So far from thinking that we hazard anything in this declaration, we sincerely believe that certain positions taken by most of the churches of the day lead to the very state of things which we deplore. Observing men, spiritually-minded men, of all denominations, have expressed their convictions and their regret that there are many superficial conver-sions in this generation. The "revivals" do not lead to self-denial and cross-bearing; the converts mostly remain selfish and worldly, and follow the world in the paths of fashion and folly. Indeed, worldly fashions and methods are adopted by the churches to carry on their work. This is seen in their socia-bles, festivals, games of hazard, and almost every imaginable folly, to raise funds. They who have come up in the present genera-tion cannot realize it, as there is nothing within the range of their observation and experience with which to contrast it. But old revivalists of thirty or.forty years ago lamented it, and almost every re-ligious paper noted it. Professor Finney, than whom no one was better known as a revivalist, gave a reason for it, and we  have ever thought that he was correct in his judgment. He said it was be-cause of the growing practice of preaching the gos-pel without the law. Inasmuch as the Scriptures declare that "By the law is the knowledge of sin,'.' Mr. Finney said that no thorough conviction of sin was  produced by such preaching; that salvation was made easy to the sinner's conscience. And what was true in his day is true to a still greater extent at present. If the error was nega-tiveŠone of  l  neglectŠthen, it is positiveŠone of in-tentionŠno*. The law is not only neglected now; it is impugned; it is largelkrepudiated as Jewish, obsolete, superseded, abolished. There is a growing disrespect for the Old Testament. And this is true even among those whose church constitutions are utterly opposed to such antinomian delusions. Some years ago we were holding meetings in a certain locality in one of "the States," and among other subjects presented the claims of the fourth commandment. A member of the only church there arose and said they were bound to receive this testimony, as it was the Bible, and they, in their church covenant, had  -agreed to take the "Bible as the rule of their faith and life. Another member denied this, and said they had covenanted to take the New Testament only. A meeting was appointed to decide the matter, and the covenant being pro-duced it was found to contain "the Bible." Upon this, a motion was made to strike "the Bible" out of the covenant, and insert "the New Testament'' in its place, which was carried! The minority very properly left that church. It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear the members of the most strictly orthodox churches ask, when a text is repeated to them, "But, is not that in  the Old Testament ?" The New Testament speakers and writers did not hold the Old Testament Šalways referred to as "the Scriptures"Šin such light esteem. "Holy men of God spake as  they were  moved by the Holy Ghost." Have the words of the Holy Ghost become unreliable? That they are so considered is no wonder when the words which Jehovah himself spoke and wroteŠhis "ten words" Šare treated with contempt, and "Reverends " and "Professors" and "Doctors of Divinity" labor to prove that the decalogue is not suited to the "genius" and " freedom " of the gospel dispensation. In all these things  the authority of God over the minds of men is weakened. They who cast aside one part of the word of God will not retain deep respect for the other. Their religion, if they profess any, be-comes formal; a system of will-worship, not so much designed to glorify God as to exalt self. It should not be looked upon as a strange thing that unbelievers are bold in their denunciations of the Bible, when it is so constantly depreciated, and its plainest precepts evaded and made of n't effect, in the churches. In obedience to the demands of free-thinkersŠwho are often such in name, and no-thinkers in factŠthe Bible is turned out of the schools, and prayer is forbidden ! It is claimed that to read the Bible or to pray in the schools is to tres-pass on the rights of those who do not believe in the Bible and in prayer. Of course they who do believe the Bible and in prayer have no rights to be con-sidered ! But allowing all that is possible in the name of charity toward unbelievers, we ask, What must be the influence of this rejection of the Bible over the minds of the rising generation? Are they not unconsciously led to scorn it as a book unworthy of an honorable position among books? Are they not prepared to give willing ears to remarks of teach-ers and professors, such as are frequently heard in normal schools and colleges, wherein science and philosophy are exalted above the Bible ?  Is  it a matter of surprise that when they grow up they are found sitting in the seat of the scornful ? The remedy for this sad state of things is not to be found in legislative enactments or amendments to constitutions. It is to be found by an "amend-ment of life" among the ministers and members of the churches. Let the ministry exalt the word of God, and lead the members to humble obedience to its precepts, instead of presenting ingenious methods whereby its requirements may be evaded. Let them raise the commandments of God above human en-actments, and preach the statutes of Jehovah as above "police regulations" and political ends. Let them teach self-denial and non-conformity to the world, and impress upon the members that it  is a privilege to give the means which God places in their hands to carry on the work of God, and a sin and a shame for a  church to resort to tricks and games to draw money for church purposes from the ungodly and the profligate. Parents and guardians have not only an interest in, but a responsibility in regard to, these matters. Educational facilities are placed within reach of all; this is well. But the tendencies of the age are alarm-ing. The wise parent will look to the moral and religious influence which surrounds the youth. Too often, alas, the influence is altogether immoral and irreligious. The danger and parental responsibility are both too great to be lightly considered. Let the Bible take a high place in all your calculations for the young. Teach them to say, "By the words of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the de_ stroyer." Ps. 17 :4. The word of God, "the blessed Bible," is our only safeguard in these days of peril. As an instance of people's readiness to accept anything but the Bible, we mention an article which we lately read, lauding the new-found "Teachings of the Apostles," because they gave color to the idea that sprinkling might be substituted for immer-sion, and that the first day of the week was the Lord's day, and not the seventh. We can infer free_ dom of action in these respects from Tertullian, and other writers of an early age. But all that has no effect upon our minds. When we accept something  as authority beside the Bible, we shall take good care that it is in harmony with the Bible, and does not contradict it. Prohibition. IT  has been our belief for more than thirty years that prohibition is the only consistent position in which temperance reformers can stand. A reforma-tion is necessarily progressive, because a complete reformation of any great abuse is never made at a single movement. We are gratified to see the progress which has been made on this subject by temperance workers. More than thirty years ago we were invited to prepare an address for a county temperance society in Wisconsin. In that we argued in favor of pro-hibition; and as a result the address was adopted by a bare majority, the dissenters mostly withdrawing from the society and working thereafter only with the Sons of Temperance ! No longer ago than 1877 we were invited to speak to a "Blue Ribbon Club" in a village in southern Michigan, and we there spoke in favor of prohibition. At the close of our remarks a prominent member of the club arose and promptly repudiated our position, stating that that was not the object of the organization, and that they had no sympathy with such remarks. In 1878 we were a little more fortunate. Being invited to speak before a temperance organization in Newark, Ohio, we presented the subject in the same light. They gave us a respectful hearing, and we were in-formed by a member, a few weeks afterward, that our remarks had been the subject of discussion at every meeting held since they were made, and most of the members were becoming convinced that we were right. But quite different from this was our experience in 1879 in this city. A Mr. Haskell was holding a series of temperance meetings, and he invited us to speak a few moments at one of them, and we were so un-sophisticated as to broach our old theme of prohibi-tion, and advocate it. Mr. Haskell was not an ani-mated or animating speaker, but on that occasion he spoke with unusual vigor in denouncing our posi-tion, and holding us up as an illustration of the fact that a man of good intentions may run into great errors ! He did not, however, make any attempt to show the fallacy of our arguments, nor have we ever known any one to attempt that task. It has been a favorite cry with many that " prohi-bition does not prohibit." That the expression is a contradiction in terms did not seem to strike their minds. What but prohibition could prohibit any-thing? Prohibition or prohibitory laws do not prohibit theft and murder, or rather, they do not prevent these crimes; evil-doers break the laws, and it has thus far been found impossible to strictly en-force them. What then ? Shall we abolish our laws against theft and murder, and acknowledge that they have proved failures? Shall we " regulate " these crimes and put them under the restrictions of high license " ? And what has seemed most strange of all is that the dealers in liquors have been the leaders in making this cry, very kindly advising the temperance people to desist from their efforts in favor of prohibitory laws, as they would surely prove ineffectual. Of course no one could doubt their sincerity in giving this advice, for who does not know that they earnestly desire that temperance workers should choose the most effective methods of accomplishing their object? What unselfish philanthropists liquor-sellers are! But some recent occurrences have materially changed the tone of these kind advisers. The pro-hibitory law of Iowa is now in force, and we have noticed some most bitter outcries from those who have been wont to proclaim that "prohibition does not prohibit." They are complaining in the strong-est terms of  the  vigorous manner in which the law is being enforced in Iowa. But why do they complain?
