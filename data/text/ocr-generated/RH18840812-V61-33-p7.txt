He is the Saviour of all men in that he has made provision whereby all may be saved, but in a special sense is he the Saviour " of those that believe." 1 Tim. 4 : 10. The great God and our Saviour.ŠOne and the same person, Jesus Christ. Thus Christ is called " God our Saviour " in the tenth verse, and also in the fourth verse of the third chapter. Paul repeatedly uses this expres- sion. See 1 Tim. 1 : 1;  and 2 : 3, etc. Peter also speaks of " our God and Saviour," and also "Lord and Saviour." See 2 Pet. 1 : 1, margin, and 1 : 11. 1 PETER 1 : 5 : An incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance is reserved in heaven for those who are kept by the power of God unto sal- vation ; and this salvation, though concealed now and seen only with the eye of faith, is all ready to be revealed when the proper time shall come. As Luther says : " The inheritance to which you are ordained has been acquired long since, and pre- pared from the beginning of the world, but lies as yet concealed, covered and sealed ; but in a short time it will be opened in a moment and disclosed, so that we may see it. limittEws 11 : 39, 40 : These all.ŠAll the wor- thies mentioned in the chapter. Having obtained, etc.ŠLiterally, " Having been attested by means of the faith.'' Their faith testified that they were worthy to receive the promises ; but though wor-thy, they did not receive them ; but seeing them by faith they embraced them, and died confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Verses 13-16. The reason of the fact just mentioned is God's gracious regard for us, which has led him to adopt such an arrangement that all shall enter upon their reward,Šthe recep- tion of the promises,Šat the same time. All the people of God will be perfected together. - .- appearing of the Lord of glory, presupposes a high degree of spiritual life ; and, on the other side, is admirably fitted to nourish, to perfect, to purify that life." . Patiently waiting.ŠInspiration foresaw that there would be a period of waiting for Christ that would discourage some ; hence the numerous pas-sages exhorting the people of God to wait patiently for the coming of Jesus : " The Lord direct your hearts . . . . into the patient waiting for Christ ;" " Here is the patience of the saints ; " " Be pa- tient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord." Query : Can a man hope to wait pa- Ł tiently for the coming of the Lord who is impa-tient in his family or about his work '? O. C. L. And thou shalt Leach. them diligently. "-Dent. s:2 LESSON FOR THE FOURTH SABBATH IN AUGUST. (See Instructor of Aug. 1,3, 188.4.) (Object of Christ's Coming.) CRITICAL NOTES. JOHN 14 : 3 : See Instructor notes. CoL. 3 : 4 : Christ, our life.ŠChrist is the only hope of a future life for mankind. God himself is the only source of life ; he only " hath life in him- self," and "he hath given to the Son to have life in himself." John 1 : 26. Christ is the " bread of life " (John 6 : 48) ; he has the " words of eternal life " (verse 68) ; h is the " resurrection and the life" (chap. 11 : 25) ; eternal life, "the gift of God," comes through him (14.oln. 6 : 23) ; he has " brought life and immortality to light through the gospel " (2 Tim. 1 : 10) ; he is the " word of life (1 John 1 : 1) ; God has given eternal life unto his people, and "this life is in his Son." " He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God bath not life." 1 John 5 : 11, 12. "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life [by faith] : he that believeth not the Son shall not see life." John 3 : 36. Shall appear. ŠShall come the second time. Compare 1 Pet. 5 : 4, 1 John 2 : 28, and 1 John 3 : 2. Ap- pear with him in glory.ŠShall be "glorified to- gaiter" with him. Rom. 8 : 17. The refe——— is to the resurrection state, when the body, sown in corruption, dishonor, and weakness, is raised in incorruption, glory, and power. 1 Cor. 15 : 42, 43. At his coming Christ " shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glo- rious body." Phil. 3 : 21. Then " we shall 'be like him ; for we shall see him as he is." 1 John 3 : 2. 2 Timontv 4. : 7, 8 : A good fight.ŠThe word is in the original 6y6va ( agona ), and means a con- test, strife, contention ; whence comes our English word agony. Paul thus likens the Christian life to a warfare,Šan earnest, hand-to-hand contest (if we may so speak) with the powers of darkness,___ but it is a good and glorious warfare, inasmuch as it is waged for the right. Finished my course.Š Completed my Christian race. See 1 Cor. 9 : 24, 25, etc. Kept the faith.ŠGuarded, defended, and obeyed the great principles of the gospel committed to his care. Verse 8.ŠWith what unstudied beauty and grace, yet how forcibly withal, does Paul contrast the Christian course with the G-re- clan games, which constitute his favorite source of illustration. for the former I As he nears the goal, his eye is fixed upon the prize, which is not a " corruptible " crown of laurel, but an " incor- ruptibIe " " crown of righteousness," a " crown of life," a "crown of glory that fadeth not away." The righteous judge.Š" Clearly a contrast with the unrighteous worldly judge, by whose sentence he was now about to be put to death."ŠLange. In that day;Š,,  The apostle refers to the day of the last. personal Parousia of the Lord, whom now he no longer hoped to live to see on earth, while the interval between his death and that moment , is rolled up into a minimum."ŠLange. Compare 2 Tim. 1 : 12, 18, with 2 Thess. 1 : 10. This testimony is very explicit to the effect that the re- ward of the righteous is not conferred at death, but at the second coming ol: our Saviour, to which event the Christian should constantly direct his attention, as to the focal point in the plan of sal- vation. To this agrees also the testimony of Peter, chap. 5 : 4 : " And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away." TITUS 2 : 11-13 : The grace of God.ŠHis kind. ness and love, or pity (verse 4), the unmerited fa- vor with which he regarded lost mankind, and which was the foundation of the whole work of redemption. Bath appeared unto all men.Š Rather with De Wette, Alford, Ellicott, and the revised version, " Hath appeared, bringing salva- Lion to all men." The provision is universal : the gracious offer is for all. It is the will of God that all should " come unto the knowledge of the truth " and be saved (1 Tim. 2 : 4) ; but many will not come. THE QUESTION CORNER. WHY could not a corner of the "Sabbath-school Department " be profitably employed in answering questions that arise in connection with the Sabbath- school work 'I The answer to the question is so evident as not to need stating ; and the announce- went is therefore made that all questions pertain- . mg to the Sabbath-school work, addressed to the REVIEW AND HERALD., will receive prompt and careful attention. If they are thought to be of sufficient general interest they will be answered in this 'corner ; " otherwise they will be answered by mail if stamp be enclosed for reply. Here, to begin with, is a letter from a sister in Wisconsin who states that their school of about 30 members is poor, but they desire to get maps or books that will help to a clearer understanding of the lessons. They have classes in three differ- ent numbers of the " Bible Lessons," also two classes studying the lessons in the Instructor. They wish advice as to what helps to obtain. I will speak of those which are most essential, and will name them in what I consider the order of their importance. 1. The three volumes of " Spirit of Prophecy," or the "Great Controversy," together with the forth-coming volume, and "Sketches from the Life of Paul." These volumes throw great light upon the Scriptures, and should be carefully stud- ied in connection with every lesson. There are, or ought to be, several sets of them in every church, and the school ought to have the benefit of them without extra cost. 2. Two maps of Palestine ; one for Old Testa- ment times, the other for the New. They can be obtained, 41x28 inches in size, for $1.50 each. A much  finer map, 58x41 inches, will cost $3.00 each. 3. A Concordance. An abridged edition of Cru- den's work, sufficiently full for all practical pur- poses may be obtained for about $1.00. Then comes Cruden's unabridged for about $1.75, and Young's, the most complete of all, for $3.00. Be- sides a copy for general use in the school, every teacher--yes, every-  familyŠought to have a con-cordance for private use. 4. A Bible Dictionary. The best in one volume is Smith and Barnum's, costing $5.00 in cloth and, $6.00 in leather ; but a smaller one published by the Am. Tract Society is an excellent work, com-plete enough, perhaps, for ordinary use, and costs only $1.50. 5. The " Story of the Bible" is designed to bring the Scripture narrative down to the understanding of the young, and being finely illustrated is an ex-cellent help for those who have small classes. Cost, $1.00. "Palestine for the Young " is an- other excellent work, and could be profitably used in studying the maps of Palestine. Its price is only $1.00. Any or all of these helps can doubtless be oh-tained by addressing the State Secretary of your respective Tract Society. Many more excellent works might be mentioned, but these will do to begin with. C. C. L. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS. Christ our life.ŠRead again the passages re- ferred to in the " Critical Notes e  which show Christ to be our only source and hope of eternal life, and consider the questions, Am I truly a . child of God I and have I an abiding faith in the Lifegiver I Christ is "our life " if we have a living connection with him and our lives are de- voted to his service. He does not want us to beŁ lieve in a merely theoretical way that he is the Lifegiver, but to believe with a "frith that works by love, and purifies the heart " that he is our personal Saviour. Not only is he "our life" hereafter, but he is "our life " here. He is the only source of spiritual life. Our relation to him should be as close and vital as that of the branch to the vine. Indeed, this must be the case if we ever gain eternal life. .His life must flow into ours. We in ust daily feel the invigorating effects of a transfusion of his life into our own, or we shall miss eternal life. Spiritual life here means eter- nal life hereafter. Would you live eternally in the future IŠLive in Christ at the present. ' Glorified with him.ŠChrist was upon earth the first time in shame, subject to the insults of wicked men. They mocked and scourged him ; they even spit upon him, and took his life. But when he comes again it will be with the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Every eye shall see him ; and the guilty will quail with shame and fear be- fore him. So the true children of Christ will suf- for persecution, and be subject to the indignities of wicked men 'while passing through their earthly pilgrimage ; but they have this to comfort them, that when the chief' Shepherd shall appear, they will receive a crown of unfading glory ; when their Master is glorified they shall be glorified with him. Let us, then, be willing to suffer with Christ, that we may be glorified together with him. " If we suffer, we shall also reign with him." Loving his appearing.ŠIt is a terrible thing not to love the appearing of Christ. It speaks of an unconsecrated heart and life to scoff' at that event, or treat it lightly. One would think from the way the Bible speaks of the matter that a person could not be a good Christian who did not believe in, and love the appearing of, our Saviour. And such, no doubt, is the case. Paul says a crown of righteousness will be given to all in the great day "who love his appearing." What hope of a crown can those have who dislike his appearing, and scoff at those who are 'tasting unto that day '1 Says Lange : u The affectionate longing for the ŠThe day has ended and the sun has set, Unfinished is the task I planned to do ; I sit and ponder o'er with deep regret  The golden sunlight vanished from my view.  And thus full oft at last when life doth close, And toil is ended for the restless feet, ' And for the busy hands the long rePose, Ł The cherished work of life is incomplete. 0 Thou, who knowest-all from sun to sun,  From birthday morning to death's evening chill, Look on Thy children, with their tasks undone, In loving kindness, and forgive them still.
