BEHOLD how glorious! Behold The light of Christ's face; and such light! The Moslem, Buddhist, as of old, Ł Gropes helpless on in hopeless night. But lo! where Christ comes, crowned with flame, Ten thousand triumphs in Christ's name. Elijah's chariot of fire, Chained lightnings harnessed to his car, Jove's thunders bridled by a wireŠ Call unto nations, "Here we are." Lo! all the world one sea of light, Save where the paynim walks in night. What more? What sermons like to these, This light of Christ's face, power, speed, In these full rounded centuries, To prove the Christ the Christ indeed? Yea, Christ is life, and Christ is light, And antichrist is death and night. F Examiner. 4.  NURSO 0.      A Sketch of Indian Native Christian Life. IT is delightful to trace the beginnings of the new life in any soul; but some there are who awaken our special interest and admira-tion, and such, it seems to me, is the_ one whose story is briefly given below. Nursoo was, for many years, engaged in daring deeds of theft and robbery. Again and .again was he thrown into prison for his lawless acts. One day, while visiting a village near his ,own, he met Mr. H., a missionary, who was going about preaching in that district. The latter spoke a few words to him. Nursoo went his way, and the one who had spoken to him saw him BO more for several years; but the .Spirit of the Lord followed him. The question so kindly put, "Are you a Chris-tian, Nursoo?' with the added words, "You ought to be," sank into his heart; nor did his struggle cease till he had found pardon in Christ. He was 'baptized a little later; some eleVen or twelve years ago, and received into the Watwad church, sixty miles and more to the northeast of Sholapur. And now, when we visit that region, no one greets us more cordially than this same good Man. His heart seems to be overflowing with gratitude for having been told of Jesus, the Saviour. Often, on hearing of our arrival, this dear man hastens to our tent with eggs and fowls, rice and flour, too, perhaps. "But, Nursoo, we do not care for your good things," he is told over and over again ; "we come to bring you helpŠto tell you more of the better life." And the reply is ever the same, "If the Lord gives me these things, they are yours." At one time, after Mr. H. had been re-fusing some favor from him, Nursoo remarked, "I would be willing to take out a piece of my flesh and give it to you if necessary." One day, after the birth of his little son, when we were in tents near his village, Nursoo's heart was so full of gratitude that his gifts seemed to have no limit. It was hard for us to express our thanks. "Don't thank me," he said ; "thank .the Lord alone. He has prospered me, and I want to do for you who have come from such a distance, and have done so much for us." When told to lay by something for himself and family for a time of need, he replied, "The Lord has had compassion on me, a miserable sinner, and now I wish to do  all I can for others, for the poor and needy, and especially for the widow and the father- less." And this he has done, in various waYs. At a special meeting of the Watwad Chris-tians, a few years since, the widows being es- pecially invited, a garment was given by Nur- soo to each of the latter who. were present, ten or eleven in number, thus causing joy and relief to their hearts. Indeed, his home seems to be a place where the Christians, being ever welcome, love to go. A humble, modest man he always seems, of the lowest caste, too, being a watchman, or night guard, of his lit-tle village, and receiving in return for his serv- ices various perquisites for his support from the farmers there; yet his tall, upright figure, his pleasant, bright eye, and his kind, homely face seem really attractive. One day the question was put to him by Mr. H., "Nursoo, what are you doing now for Christ?" No answer. Again the same question, and yet no reply. The third time, too, and the simple answer was, "Nothing." But the poor man was evidently stirred in his soul. He went home and thought it all over. "I cannot read," he said to himself; "I am an ignorant man; but I can pray, and I'll do it." So, night after night, Nursoo, before beginning his duties as watchman, goes off into a field, where he can be quite alone (for his house has but one room, where the whole family cook, eat, and sleep), and there, prostrating himself, he prays earnestly for a blessing on his own family, and that the Lord's kingdom might come in the hearts of his neighbors and friends. And the fruit -has already appeared. Sev-eral of the families near him have come out and fearlessly acknowledged Christ as their Saviour, their conversion being traced to his direct influence. Indeed, several from the higher classes of the Hindus were for a time So much influenced by him that many of their relatives and friends consulted together what should be done. "Nursoo," they said, "if you go on influencing our young men in this way, and disregarding the gods we wor-ship, you will have to leave here, and then, if you have no work, what will you do? Will you go to the government official?" "No." "Will you go to your missionary?" "No," was the answer; "I will not trouble him or anyone. I will try some other means of liv-ing, but if I fail, I will just fold my hands meekly, and commit my life again to Him who gave it." The people seemed impressed by his reply, and, on thinking further of the matter, decided to have him remain in his work. And to-day he seems more highly re-spected in his village than ever before.ŠSe-lected. THE VALUE OF MISSIONARY SCHOOLS. Miss FREDRICKSON, a Baptist missionary at Rangoon, Burmah, writes as follows to the home officials in regard to schools and their relation to the work of saving souls -- "I do heartily believe in schools, because I see nothing else that can take their place in bringing the young under continued Chris-tian influence. . . . Of all the girls who have gone out from the school, forty-seven are now actively engaged in the work of the mission, mostly .in school work; some are Bible women, others are wives of native pas-tors, and many have married and established Christian homes. The customs of the coun-try are such that a young girl cannot go out as a Bible woman, because the heathen have no respect for them, and will say very un-kind things about them. When they go out as teachers, they have large opportunities for Christian work among the heathen, which they Could not gain in any other way. The school is the opening wedge. "The results of the school work are not to be measured always by figures and apparent  results.- We have lately—had a striking illus7  tration of that. A native of India, who was in the British army, ,a Mohammedan; was. baptized in Pegii, gOe up his work, and, came to Rangoon, and, is Working among  the Mo,,. hammedans here. He is an earnest worker,, and, humanly speaking, is doing a work no other can do, because he is finely educated,' and knows all about their religion and books, and knows the Bible, too. He was seven years in a mission school, and left it appar-ently as he came into it, a heathen. But he never forgot the scripture which he learned there, and the Holy. Spirit used it to lead to his conversion. "One of the girls from the school was at home during the vacation; her parents took her to the pagoda to worship. She xefused, saying, 'It is only brick and stone, and can-not hear or help me.' She is not a Christian, but her faith in idols is destroyed. I am convinced that the school is an important means of evangelization, and without it our work would suffer all along the line. The government schools are not turning out the material of which we can make Christian workers, nor are they such as we would wish to educate our Christians in." KAFFIR WESLEYANS. THERE are said to be over 30,000 Protestant Kaffir members in the Wesleyan missions in South Africa, and they are all professed ab-stainers from intoxicating liquors. The 'Wes- leyan Missionary Notices an account of the experience of one who gave up the use of both the native beer and tobacco:Š "He had gone home that night, thrown the beer away, and destroyed the pot; heaven came down into his soul, and it was very blessed. (mandikakulu); be assembled his fam-ily for prayer, and it was mandi kakulu; be Went to his place of private prayer among the rocks, and it was mandi kakulu, God himself filling his soul with the joy of salvation. In the night he awoke; still mandi kakulu; but, turning to seek a live coal with which to light his pipe, the ubanmandi (blessedness) van-ished, he knew not where or how; but there and then he had fought out the matter. His reason said, 'I have surrendered beer; surely tobacco is no sin!' His conscience answered, `You have killed the cow; now you must kill the calf.' Still reason argued, but again and again conscience replied,'You have killed the cow; now you must kill the calf;' and be could get no return of blessedness until his surrender was complete, and the last idol was put away; he had destroyed his pipe, and resolved that both beer and tobacco should henceforth be laid in absolute-  surrender on God's altar." Ł A HINT. A MISSIONARY of experience gives this sug-gestive hint, which is worthy of note:Š "Let me say to those who may be looking forward to work in India, make sure before sailing that you can give a reason for the hope that is in you. That reason will be in de-mand when you work among Hindus. "Both the study of apostolic Christianity and religions of India will be of use in un-derstanding better the nature of the problems which must be met on the mission field. Especially has the study of the early conflict of Christianity and paganism in the Roman Empire thrown light on the modern conflict in India. Both by the similarities and the differences of these two conflicts, are one's anticipations of immediate success sobered, while one's faith in the ultimate triumph grows more firm and abiding." IT requires more grace to suffer patiently than to serve laboriously.ŠT. Jones.
