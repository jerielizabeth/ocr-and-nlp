246 THE HEALTH REFORMER. A True Sentiment. "THE Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," in the Atlantic Monthly, says he firmly believes that if all the materia medics, as now used, (with some exceptions which he specifies) " could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be the better for mankind, and all the worse for fishes." Verily, when sentiments like these begin to prevail in high circles, there is hope for our cause. A. M. Apples. MANY persons do not value apples sufficiently as an important article of diet. Besides con-taining a large amount of sugar, mucilage, and other nutritive matter, this fruit contains veg-etable acids, aromatic qualities, etc., which act powerfully in the capacity of refrigerants, ton-ics, and antiseptics, and when freely used at the season of mellow ripeness prevent debility, indigestion, and avert, without doubt, many of the " ills which flesh is heir to." The operators of Cornwall, England, consider ripe apples nearly as nourishing as bread, and far more so than potatoes. In the year 1810Šwhich was a year of much scarcityŠapples, instead of being converted into cider, were sold to the poor, and the laborers asserted that they " could stand their work" on baked apples without meat ; whereas a potato diet required either meat or some other substantial nutriment. The French and Germans use apples extensively, as do the inhabitants of all European nations. The laborers depend upon them as an article of food, and frequently make a dinner of sliced apples and bread. There is no food cooked in as many different ways in our country as apples, nor is there any fruit whose value, as an article of nutriment, is so great. And old gentleman recently stated to us that every fall he used to have a severe sickness, but since he bought during the season a barrel of good apples, for himself alone, and ate the whole barrel in two or three months, he had every year saved himself from this sickness, without wanting a  doctor.ŠManufacturer and Builder. AVOID EVIL HABITS.ŠIt is related that an Indian once brought up a young lion, and find-ing him weak and harmless, never attempted to control him. Every day the lion gained in strength and became more difficult to manage. At last when excited by rage, he fell upon the Indian and tore him in pieces. It is thus with evil habits and bad passions. They are like this lion. If indulged in youth, they will cause us much vexation in after life, and may perhaps destroy us. Youth, remember, and beware ! Insanity and Crime. " INSANITY "  is often the excuse for wicked-ness. In many cases it is doubtless impossible to decide at what point moral accountability ceases and madness begins. It is certain, how-ever, that unbridled passions often lead to mad-ness, and there is no safety in giving free license to the animal part of man's nature. A recent English magazine puts forth the theory that many notable persons of past ages were insane ; and thus accounts for their wild and wicked deeds. He believes that Robespierre was made insane by the exciting events of the time ; that Louis XI. was insane both in his despotic cruelty and in his caprices ; and that Jeffries, the notorious English judge, was a raving ma-niac. He also asserts that Nero and Caligula were lunatics, and their cruelty and tyranny the outbursts of insanity. The capricious freaks of Heliogabalus are called madness, and the ambition of Alexander the Great a disease of the mind. ALL THE SAME FOR THE PATIENTS.ŠA good anecdote of Dr. Garth is told in connection with the Kit Kat. He paid a visit to the club one night, but said he must shortly go, as he had fifteen patients to attend. Some good wine, however, having been produced, Garth forgot all about his patients till reminded of them by Steele. Hereupon the jovial author-physician said, " It's no matter whether I at-tend them to-night or not ; for nine of them have such bad constitutions that all the physi-cians in the world can't save them, and the other six have such good constitutions that all the physicians in the world can't kill them. SCOLDINGŠOf all the disagreeable and use-less habits the world was ever troubled with, scolding is the most annoying. To hear a saw filed, to hear a steamboat wistle, to hear an ass bray, to hear a peacock scream, or an Indian yell, is music compared with it. Since we were a little child we have always felt a mortal ab-horrence to scolding. If we had been scolded as some children are, we know not as we ever should have been good for anything. Our sen-sitive spirit would have rebelled and wrought itself into a hateful, discordant thing. It is no wonder many children are bad. The good is all scolded out of them. It is stunted or killed by early frosts of cold, icy scolding. What a frost is to the spring buds, is scolding to all the best in the child heart. Scolding folks at home ! How miserable ! Lightning, thunder, hail, storm and winds, let them all come, rather than hurricanes of scolding. Let all the powers that be wage a war of kindness on all the scolders, that they may be overcome with a better spirit. ŠSel.
