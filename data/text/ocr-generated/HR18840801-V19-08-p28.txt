252 GOOD age? Ans. 1. The causes of epilepsy are various. It is a functional disorder, the disease being in some cases the result of hereditary pre-disposi-tion. In the majority of cases, however, it is a functional disturbance of the nervous system, due to a disorder of the stomach, or liver, or both. It is frequently the result of excesses of various sorts. In some cases the disease is the result of organic changes of the brain. Such cases are of course incurable. When due to other causes, with the exception of marked pre-disposition, it is usually amenable to treatment. An attack can sometimes be avoided, when the patient has sufficient warning, by a vigorous ef-fort of the will, by repulsive applications to the head, and by the use of certain remedies which are well known to the profession, and have long been in use for this purpose. Nitrate amyl is the most efficient of these remedies. One or two drops may be inhaled at the time the symp-toms of an attack make their appearance. 2. No ; carbonic acid gas is not particularly unwholesome, as it is the mildest of acids, and may be considered innocuous when taken into the stomach in the form of soda-water or otherwise. 3. Soda-water is rendered objectionable by the deleterious character of the syrups used with it, many of which are wholly innocent of any connection with the natural fruits from which they are named. Sleep.ŠA correspondent makes the following inquiries: 1. Why do animals sleep after eating, and is it good for them? 2. Is it better to sleep on the back or on the side; and if on the side, which side? Ans. 1. We have made some observations on the conduct of animals after eating, and are in-clined to .the opinion that the general supposi-tion that sleeping after eating is a natural condi-tion, is erroneous. The observations of phys-iologists show that digestion goes on very much more slowly during sleep than during waking hours. The horse, cow, and dog usually lie down after eating ; but our observation is that they seldom sleep soundly. The dog lies be-hind the stove after eating dinner, and closes his eyes in a sort of after-dinner reverie, but sel. dom gives the appearance of sleeping soundly. If the animal falls into a sleep, it is a troubled, dreamy doze, as is indicated by groans, growls, and other marks of disturbance. 2. As a rule, lying on the side is the best po-sition for sleeping. Which side, is a matter of in-difference, unless a meal has been taken within two or three hours, in which case, the right side is preferable. Mental Labor and Longevity.ŠThe ques-tion is asked : " How does mental labor affect longevity ?" Ans. Carefully prepared statistics show that mental labor is conducive to longevity. The active mental worker who takes reasonable care of his health, has greater chance of long life than the man who devotes himself to muscular pur-suits. Mental labor is stimulating to all the vi-tal powers, and conducive to the best health. Sprains. ŠA correspondent wishes to know if a sprained member should be exercised. Ans. The proper treatment of a sprain is rest, continuing until the swelling has disappeared. YawningŠSleeping with Head Covered. ŠA subscriber asks the following questions : 1. What causes yawning? 2. What would you do with a child who sleeps with its head covered, and what is the cause? A ns. 1. Sleepiness, as a rule. Sometimes it is the result of contagion. We have seen a yawn travel around a circle, each individual yawning in his turn. 2. The child should be taught to sleep with its head uncovered. Young children usually cover their heads to hide away from the "big black man in the dark," about whom they are told for the purpose of keeping them quiet when inclined to cry, or to make them tractable when disposed to be unruly. Nothing could be more cruel than the common custom of frightening children by stories about ghosts, spirits, and other mythical dangers which are supposed to lurk in the dark. Glucose as a FoodŠEnlarged VeinsŠShav-ingŁŠThe following questions have been pre-sented for answer : 1. Is glucose, as a food, healthful? 2. Are large veins a sign of heart troubled 3. Is shaving the beard detrimental to health? If so, why? Ans. 1. No. Glucose, or corn sugar, is not a natural product; and if it could be shown that glucose, in itself, is not harmful, it is rarely, if ever, free from mixture with sulphuric acid, which is recognized as deleterious. 2. Enlargement and pulsation of veins is an indication of one form of heart disease. 3. When a person has been accustomed to wear-ing a beard, shaving may facilitate the contrac-tion of colds, particularly a cold in the throat. It is also possible that frequent shaving may main-tain a sensitive condition of the face which will predispose to disease of the throat. We are not certain of this, however ; yet we are positive that a man cannot suffer more from the absence of a beard than a woman, who naturally has no beard, provided both live under the same condi-tions. The beard is undoubtedly a natural and wholesome protection for the face and throat, but probably its chief service is eesthetic and dis-tinctive of sex, rather than hygienic. Epilepsy Š Soda-Water.ŠA correspondent inquires as follows : 1. What causes epilepsy, and what can be done by the inexperienced to alleviate an attack? 2. Do you regard the car-bonic acid gas, with which various "temperance drinks" are charged, as a tonic to the stomach? 3. What do you think of soda-water as a bever- Ł
