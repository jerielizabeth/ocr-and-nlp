VOL. 19. BATTLE CREEK, MIOH., AUGUST, 1884. NO, 8 THE BLACK HOLE OF CALCUTTA. ALL of our readers have read of the Black Hole of Calcutta, where one hun-dred and forty-six men were imprisoned in a small, unventilated prison, in which the greater number died in a few hours, destroyed by the poisonous emanations from their own bodies. The following account of this horrible experience is from the pen of the commanding officer, Mr. Holwell, who was one of the few survi-vors : - 1G  Figure to yourself the situation of a hundred and forty-six wretches, exhausted by continual fatigue and action, crammed together in a cube of eighteen feet, in a close, sultry night in Bengal, shut up to the eastward and southward (the only quarter whence air could reach us) by dead walls, and by a wall and door to the north, open only to the westward by two windows strongly barred with iron, from which we could receive scarce any the least circulation of the fresh air. . . . We had been but a few minutes confined before every one fell into a perspiration so profuse you can form no idea of it. This brought on raging thirst, which in-creased in proportion as the body was drained of its moisture. Various expe-dients were thought of to give more room and air. To gain the former it was moved to put off their clothes; this was approved as a happy motion, and in a few moments every one was strippedŠmyself, Mr. Court, and the two young gentlemen by me, excepted. For a little while they flattered themselves with having gained a mighty advantage ; every hat was put in motion to gain a circulation of air, and  Mr. Baillie proposed that every man should sit down on his hams. This expe-dient was several times put in practice, and at each time many of the poor creat-ures, whose natural strength was less than that of others, or who had been more exhausted, and could not immedi-ately recover their legs when the word was given to riseŠfell to rise no more, for they were instantly trod to death or suffocated. When the whole body sat down, they were so closely wedged together that they were obliged to use many efforts before they could get up again. Before nine o'clock, every man's thirst grew intolera-ble, and respiration difficult. Efforts were made to force the door, but in vain. Many insults were used to the guard to provoke them to fire on us. For my own part, I hitherto felt little pain or uneas-iness, but what resulted from my anxiety for the sufferings of those within. By keeping my face close between two of the bars, I obtained air enough to give my lungs easy play, though my perspiration was excessive, and thirst commencing. At this period, so strong a urinous volatile ef-fluvia came from the prison, that I was not able to turn my head that way for more than a few seconds at a time. " Now everybody, except those situated in and near the windows, began to grow outrageous, and many delirious. Water! water! became the general cry. An old Jemantdaar, taking pity on us, ordered the people to bring us some skins of water. This was what I dreaded. I foresaw it would prove the ruin of the small chance left us, and assayed many times to speak to him privately to forbid its being brought ; but the clamor was so loud it became impossible. The water ap-peared. Words cannot paint the univer-
