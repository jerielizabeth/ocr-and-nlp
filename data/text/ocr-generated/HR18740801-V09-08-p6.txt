"""1.1.1110111MINPIIII  230 THE HEALTH REFORMER. to were chiefly vegetarians. Now if we were required to understand that these men were hygienists, we might have some occasion for modifying our views on the meat question ; but we ascertained some time since that hygiene and vegetarianism are by no means synonymous terms. A vegetarian is simply a person who eats no animal food. As no intimation to the contrary is given, we shall be justified in sup-posing that with the exception of being de-prived of meat, these six hundred laborers lived in a manner not differing from the mode of life customary with others of the same class in France. Now what are the general dietetic habits of the French I No other nation indulges so largely in the refinements of the culinary art as do they. Highly seasoned viands are habitual constituents of their bills of fare. Savory soups and stews, redolent with pungent herbs and ir-ritating condiments, are, special favorites with the native French, as every one is aware. Fine-flour bread, rich and innutritious pastry, indi-gestible pickles, and other unwholesome articles, also receive as large a share of patronage as in this country. Under such circumstances, it is quite possible that flesh food, when not excess-ively diseased, would be the most wholesome article of the whole dietary. We unhesitatingly express our firm convic-tion that animal food is unnatural for man, that it is unfavorable to longevity even when only the very best is eaten, and that its use is pro-ductive of a great amount of suffering on ac-count of its great liability to serious contamina-tion by disease. Notwithstanding this, we freely acknowledge that flesh is nutritious food, and that, in general, its use is not attended by nearly as pernicious consequences as is the con-stant use of condiments, tea and coffee, fine-flour, or even a great amount of liquid food. Flesh is not the best food. Fine-flour bread is still more inferior. We never recommend people to abandon the use of animal food and then attempt to subsist on the 'residue of their former dietary. The continuance of the use of flesh would be much preferable to this course. Neither would we hesitate to recommend the use of flesh food to a person whose circumstances were such that he could not obtain an abundance of wholesome vegetable food. In the case of the Frenchmen referred to in the paragraph quoted, we may fairly suppose  that sufficiency of good, nourishing food was not provided, so that their systems were illy nour-ished. Under those circumstances, the use of meat was doubtless beneficial ; but if the fine-flour bread had been exchanged for graham, and if the pickles, highly seasoned soups, and other injurious articles of diet had been ex-changed for wholesome, nutritious, hygienic food, without the addition of meat, we have not the slightest doubt but that still greater benefit would have been received. As an illustration of the wide difference be-tween mere vegetarians and true hygienists, we will give the following recipe which we find in a vegetarian cook book, and which, as will be seen, is composed of vegetable substances, but is, at the same time, one of the most indi-gestible and irritating compounds imaginable:Š "The pickle may consist of one quart of vin-egar, ground black pepper one ounce, ground ginger half an ounce, mace half a drachm, cloves one drachm, mustard seed one ounce, and a little salt." The same book directs that green walnuts should be allowed to soak in brine for a  week, and then be placed in the above abominable compound. This is vegetarianism, but is cer-tainly far from being hygienic. Indeed, a din-ner of ham and sausage, even with some risk of trichinae poisoning, would be almost 'prefera-ble to such a dish. But perhaps we have already devoted quite sufficient space to the consideration of this "Pill for the Vegetarians ; ", for upon close examina-tion it is readily seen to be wholly inconclusive, from the fact that all the benefit which was at-tributed to meat-eating may have been wholly due to improvement in sanitary conditions con-cerning which nothing is said. Science, experience, and common sense all concur, that meat-eating is unnatural and un-healthful ; and we shall continue to advocate this among other hygienic truths until some more highly potentized pill than the homeo-pathic pellet just examined is presented. AMUSING THE CHILDREN.-A Boston clergy-man, who believes in amusements, if properly conducted, says it is quite curious to note how many of our people have attended the circus the past week, only because they wanted to " please the children ; " but still more curious to observe that in very many instances it has taken two or three able-bodied men, with as many strong women, to look after one darling little boy or girl.ŠSe/.
