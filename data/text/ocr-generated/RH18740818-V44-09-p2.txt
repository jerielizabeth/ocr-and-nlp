66 t·egarded as forcible evidence of the imity of the Judgment. G. They are explained in a manner to the reader to believe them to be ative. 7. As it would be absurd to make a eral application, when a figurative tion is intended (as in the case of Joseph's dream, concerning the sun, moon, and eleven .stars, that of the fourth trumpet, and that of the symbolic woman of Rev. 12), so it would be absurd to make a figumtive plication when a literal one is intended. 8. And finally, in the case under eration, reason unites with Scripture in I! uiring that the leading sign.-; of so tant an invent be described literally, that they relate to things which all can ciate, that they may serve as a key which can be used in opening to other evidences, and a firm basis on which to build a ous and harmonious system of truth, which the most skeptical minds cannot fail to prehend, if they will take pains to ine it with that candor that its importance demands. Y. Object'ions against pt·eC'is,ion, etc. OB.T. l. The apostles wrote as though Christ might come in the apostles' days. ANs. This objection not only represents the inspired apostles as making wrong pressions in their writings, but it is l.'· opposed to the teachings of the apostles. Paul strongly cautioned the church of his time not to be deceived by spirit, by word, or by letter, as that the day of Christ was at hand. 2 Thess. 2. 4lBJ. 2. No man can tell the day and !tour of Christ's coming. ANs. This does not prove that we may not know when Christ is ncar, even at the doOI'S, or when we have reached the last generation. ,_ OBJ. 3. Christ will come to all as a thief. ANs. If this is genuine, then all will be lost; for a thief comes to ;.; troy. But it is to those who cry peace and that Christ comes as a thief. The watching, believing church are not in darkness, that the day of the Lord should overtake them as a thief. 1 Thess. 5 : 
2; Rev. 3:3. OBJ. 4. Christ says," Y e know not when the time is." Mark 13 : 33. ANs. The time Christ here speaks of is the " day and hour." See previous verse. OBJ. 5. The coming of the Lord will be like the lightning. Matt. 24: 27. ANS. As the lightning that cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west, so Christ is speaking of the publicity and extent of his coming by way of opposing those views which represent that coming to take place in a secret manner. Read previous verse. 0BJ. 6. Peter declares, "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a sand years as one day." 2 Pet. 3 : 
8. ANs. Peter is writing to connteract the influence of the latter-day scoffers who would say, " ·where is the promise of his coming ? " and to inspire confidence in the certainty of the Lord's promise concerning his coming. It is in regard to God's promises that a thousand years are with the Lord as one day. That is, what God has promised one thousand years ago will be as surely fulfilled as though he had promised it to-day. OBJ. 7. You were disappointed in 1844, and may fail again. The Jews who came out of Egypt were disappointed when, instead of entering into the land of Canaan three weeks after the exode, they remained forty years in the wilderness to be tempted. Was not the Lord leading them ? The disciples were also greatly disappointed when their Lord was crucified. Was the message which they had faithfully borne for over three years a false message ? There was to be a tarrying time, and progressive ment in the truth by the church, and many prophecies were to be fulfilled in the appointment, to give still greater force to the ad vent doctrine. Matt. 2;j : 5 ; He b. 10: 35-39; Rev. 10. 0BJ. 8. Why did not the apostles dwell more upon these prophecies and upon the prophetic periods ? Axs. The apostles wrote quite largely upon these prophecies as to be fulfilled in the future from their day. They laid stress on prophecies and times fulfilling in their (lay. Christ commenced his by saying, "The time is fulfilled." 1: 1:'5. He evidently 1·efen-ed to the nine weeks !'eaching to Messiah the Pr.ince. Dan. 9. We should also lay special stress upon the prophecies and periods fulfilling in our times. Why was not a Noah raised ADVENT REVIE"r ANl) IIERALD OF THE ... Vol. 44, No. 9. up .to preach theJlood in the days of Adam? And why did not a special message go forth on the immediate first advent of the siah in the days of David ? 0BJ. 9. The important thing is to be ready. ANs. Yes; but to be ready we must love Christ, and if we love Christ we shall long to see him, and shall respect and cheerfully welcome evidences of his speedy return. VI. Inconsistencies of the opposition. Truth is a unit, and those who defend it can present a connected, consistent and harmonious theory, while error is noted for its zigzag course, and those who tain it will naturally run into various consistencies and contradictions. .For instance, those who oppose us on the speedy return of Christ, will commence their opposition by saying, "Christ may come to-day, and he may not come for one or two thousand years;" but before they get through you will perhaps hear them plead that the world must be converted before the coming of Christ. If Christ may come to-day, how can they be positive that the world will be converted? How can they tell that Christ will not come in this generation? and why oppose us? Again, sometimes our opponents will claim that our points of difference consist in non-essentials, yet they will make these points essential in fiercely opposing our views. But tlJe worst feature of this claim is that it bears directly against the sacred Scriphues, and when made ately and in the blazing light of truth, we cannot regard it as being less than lege. One of our points of difference is, that we believe the prophecies may be derstood, while many say that some ecies cannot be understood. Thus they leave the impression that God undertook to give a revelation to man, but failed by putting into the Bible things that are not and can neve1· be a 1·evelation to fallen man. We claim it to be an important duty to proclaim the immediate coming of Christ in response to the many prophecies which show that he is near, and .that he should be preached as such. But those who oppose us say we should not engage in such a work, and thereby they lower and oppose the numerous scriptures which enjoin this work on the church. But in no one thing are the cies of our opponents more apparent than in their efforts to evade the force of the signs in the sun, moon, and stars. Some will take the position that these signs given by the Saviour were fulfilled, as corded by Josephus, just before the stmction of Jerusalem, and that the struction of Jerusalem is the tribulation spoken of in connection with the signs. But the fallacy of such views is clearly exposed by the followed facts:-1. This makes the signs appear before the tribulation, while Christ says, (liately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven." Matt. 24: 2D. 2. Josephus speaks of no such signs, but speaks of'signs very unlike these; as the sword hanging over Jerusalem, the gates of Jerusalem being opened without hand, and the man walking around the doomed city for days, crying, " Woe to this city," and finally saying, "Woe to me," when a stone fell upon him, and he died. But, the unusual darkness of the night ing, were the result of an eclipse. But in tracing eclipses back by astronomy, you have to halt this side of the dark day or beyond that Jay to find an eclipse. It could not be an eclipse caused by the moon, for an eclipse of the sun as caused by the moon can take place only at new moon; but that dru:·kness occurred at about the time of full moon ; so that men of science affirm that "the causes of these phenomena are unknown. They certainly Vlere not the result of eclipses." "For which no satisfactory cause has been Sear!-!' Gwide to edge. Noah WcbsteJ', in New Htwen Dacily Herald. Astronomy is also too much fot· our ponents on the falling stars; for it meets them by saying of the meteoric display of November 13, 1833, "The greatest oric display ever known." "We now eorne to by far the most splendid display on record. . . . 
In many districts the mass of the population were horror-struck, and the mm·e enlightened were awed at templating so vivid a picture of the alyptic image-that of the stars of heaven falling to the even as a fig-tree ing her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."-Asa. S1nith'f-i oTny, p. 23. The fact that these displays are cal does not lessen the foree of this derful exhibition. It is not to be expected that Jehovah shall lay aside the laws he has established, and diReard all natural means in accomplishing his wonders to fill the prophetic word. Not long since, 11 preacher in opposing us on this point : " Our earth in its circuit a1·ound the KUn passes through two belts of gases at diffel'ent points, and it passes through these gases with such velocity that it nites them, and the result is falling stars." But the question still recurs, Why was there such a wonderful display in 1833 ? Did the earth go faster through one of the belts that year? or did God add more gas for the occasion ? The hand of God was in that sign. Our views on this subject being able and scriptural, what is the nature of the opposition ? I do not now speak of man's motiYes and of the amount of light our opponents have. I leave these points between them and the Judge of all, who tries the reins and the hearts, and will bring every work into Judgment, with ery secret thing. Our message being a Bible message, we at·e shut up to the lowing conclusions :-1. The opposition is a war against God and his word. 2. It tends to calm the people in lief, so that they will not discern the signs of the times, and that the great day of God overtake them as a thief. 3. It encourages those who mock at the idea of Christ's immediate coming to mock on. 4. It encourages men to act as the es acted in the days of Noah. ;j, It destroys in the minds of those who maintain it the strong motive to ance, that is based on the fact that "the great day of the Lord is near and hasteth greatly." Zeph. 1:14; 2:1-3; Joel 2: 1. G. It grieves those who long to see Christ and faithfulJy proclaim his coming, and adds to their already arduous task of preaching unpopular truth. 7. And, finally, it unqualifies the masses to be in a state of readiness to exclaim at the revelation of Jesus from Heaven," Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us." Isa. 2.j : 8. Dear reader, I beseech you in the name ( .f Christ to be on the safe side. 3. The tribulation itself cannot refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, for, first, It was to be the greatest that had been "since the beginning of the world." But the destruction of the world by a flood was a far greater tribulation than the struction of Jerusalem. Secondly, The days of the tribulation were to be ened for the elect's sake, and except those WHEX I think of many a poor, days should be shortened there should no ing man, toiling from morning to night all flesh (of the elect understood) be saved. the year round for a wretched subsistence, But hundreds of churches of the elect out-ground down by dire poverty, with neither side of the land of Judea, in other parts of the opportunity nor the inclination for Asia, in Europe, and Africa, would have mental improvement, whose whole sum of been saved if every sonl in Judea bad per-knowledge is compTehended in being able ished. Row natural and easy the applica-to spell out with difficulty the plainest tion of the tribula:tion to the sufferings of parts of the Bible; when I think of such the church under heathen and papal per-persons, I thank God that it is only secutions, and to have the literal signs ap-sary to touch the hem of Christ's garment pear immediately after that tribulation, in order to be saved; that one or two accOI·ding to facts in history. This tribu-ple gospel truths-such as," Christ came lation was indeeq the greatest that the not to call the righteous, but sinners to church had experienced, or that they ever penta.nce, "Come to me, all ye that .labor would pass through. . and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you And no less futile are the appeals of so-rest, " ru·e sufficient, by the blessing of the called leained men to science to counteract Spirit, to save and comfort the soul. the force of the signs. To illustrate : Some with quite a show of learning will affirm WE account the Scriptures of God to be that the dark day of May 19, 1780, and. the most sublime philosophy. Let Him Alone. THERE, before the Saviour's gaze of tears, lay a city, splendid apparently and in peace, and destined to enjoy another half century of existence. And the day was a common day ; the hour a common hour; no der was throbbing in the blue, unclouded sky : no deep voices of departing deities were rolling through the golden doo1·s: and yet,-soundless to mortal ears in the pled air of eternity-the knell of her tiny had begun to toll: and, in the less dialect of heaven, the fiat of her doom had been pronounced : and in the realm knoweth and needeth not any light save the light of God, the sun of her moral existence had gone down while it was yet day. \Vere her means of grace ove1·? No, not yet. 'Vas her temple closed 1 No, not yet.. We1·e her services impm;sible? No, not yet. The white-robed Levites still throngc.-1 her courts ; the singers still mad c the heavens ring with their passionate anies and silver psalms; the high priest yet sprinkled, year by year, the gold of the holiest altar with the Llood of unavailing sacrifice. No change in her was visible to mOl'tal eyes. And yet for hel', from this ment even until the end, the accepted time was over, the appointed crisis past-the day of salvation bad set into inevocable night. It was with her as it was with the barren :fig-tree, on which, next day, the pronounced his doom. The leaf of her natural life was still glossy green ; the sun still shone on her; the rain fell; the dew stole down; but the fruit would grow on her no more, and therefore the fire was kindled for the burning, the ax lifted, which would crash on the bering trunk. She was not spared for he1· beauty ; she was not forgiven for her fame. And if it were so with the favored city, may it not be so with thee, and thee, and me ? What shall the reeds of the desert do, if even the cedar be shattered at a blow? Yes; the lesson of the tears of Jesus over Jerusalem as she gleamed before him in the vernal sunshine, a gem upon her crown of hills, is this: and oh! may we all have grace to learn it now-learn it even in this solemn week : that as for her, so for us, there may be a too-late; the door may be shut without a sound; the doom sealed without a sight; life may be over before death comes. It is not -(oh! mark this) it is not that God loses his mercy, but that we lose our capacity for accepting it: it is not that God turneth away from us, but that we have utterly paralyzed our own power of turning back to him. And then the voice sighs forth with unutterable ness, "Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone." Let him alone, 0 preacher, for he hates the words of truth! Let him alone, 0 'Vord of God, for he hath set his face as a flint against thee; let him alone, 0 conscience, for he is bent on murdering thee; his sins have become not willful only but willing; he has chosen thern,-let him have them. He has loved death more than life, and lies rather than righteousness, and vice more than virtue, and the world more than Heaven, and the lusts of the flesh er than the law of God. And the Spirit of God hath striven with him, and striven in vain; all, all hath been in vain: let him alone ; let him eat of the .fruits of his own works, and be filled with his own devices. -Sel. A Ffne Sermon Spoiled. THE Christian, of Quincy, Illinois, lates how effectually a fine "efiort" of a smart young preacher was spoiled by an unappreciating father in the ministry who endured the discourse with much fei·ing. The incident fairly illustrates the modern practice of spiritualizing texts of Scripture, and giving them a meaning eign to that intended by the inspired writer. Any judicious hearer is able to apply privately the same method of cure, and no opportunity of doing it should be neglected. A young gmduate of one of the theolo<ncal schools of the preached a0 very nice discom·se f1·om the following words: "Then, fearing lest they should fall upon rocks, they cast four chors out of the stern, and wished for the day." Acts 27 : 20. Said the young preacher, "The ship represents the church. The four anchors are faith, hope, love, and prayer. tians are the crew. The sea represents the QTeat ocean of life. The storm that is the trials to which we are dent here, and the island of Melita, where
