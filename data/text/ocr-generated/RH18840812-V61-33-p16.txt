Dear brethren, have faith in God I Ask him to help you to attend this meeting. Make no other  calculation but to go, and the Lord will open the  way before you. Good ministerial help will be se- cured, and ample arrangements made to accommo-date all that come. We would be glad to see every Sabbath-keeper in Northern Michigan at this meeting. Many are young in the faith and cannot estimate the benefit to be derived from such a precious privilege. Let all such come feeling assured of an ample reward both for time and expense. Come, brethren and sisters, and bring your un- converted children. Invite your neighbors to . come. Come filled with the spirit of the Master, and we shall have a heavenly reunion in Christ.  We have many friends and brethren in the southern part of the State. To these we would extend an invitation to come. Gladly- would we all at this annual gathering. Ł R. C.

Annual Report of Dakota Tract Society, ALICE. i. BEAUMONT,meet WE would urge our brethren and sisters to bring extra bedding and ticks, plainly marked, to help supply new friends of the cause and those who are not familiar with these matters. We trust that all will, so far as possible, provide themselves with stoves of some kind, if they wish them. We shall endeavor to secure as many stoves as we can from Syracuse for general use, but where it is conven- ient it is better for brethren to supply themselves. This notice may be too late for some to carry out the suggestions, but we request all to do what they can, especially those who come the last week of the meeting. All mail for those who attend the New York camp-meeting should be marked "Camp Ground." M. H. BROWN. REDUCTION OF FARE TO THE TRAVERSE CITY CAMP-MEETING. IF those attending this meeting who take the cars at Elmira, Kalkaska, Cadillac, Reed City, or Howard City, will write me at Spencer Creek, Antrim Co., Mich., I will send them an order for an excursion ticket which will cost one and one-third fare for the Ł round trip. Those taking the cars at intermediate stations can pay full fare to one of the above named places, and then present the order for excursion ticket. It will be neces_ sary to attend to this matter immediately. Excur- sion tickets can be obtained at Grand Rapids or at any station south of that place without orders. JOHN SISLEY. TENTS FOR MISSOURI CAMP-MEETING. THE annual, camp-meeting for the Missouri Conference has been located at Independence, ten miles east of Kansas City. Perhaps this is the most central place that could have been selected that is accessible by railroad from all parts of the Conference. We shall expect a large turn-out of our people from all sections of the Conference. The time for the meeting will be decided and published in the REVIEW soon. It. will probably be about the _first of October. The weather may be cool, and all should come prepared to make themselves comfortable. There will be no buildings on the ground, so every family should have a good tent. We have made arrangements with a firm in St. Louis to furnish all the tents we want, 12x14 feet in size, for $1.75 each, with freight added, which will make the net cost about $2.50. We shall want to know several weeks before the meeting, how many tents will be wanted, so we can have them on the ground in good season. Let every one who wants to rent a tent write to me immediately at Kingsville, Johnson Co., Mo., and their tents will be on the ground and pitched the day before the- meeting begins. Brethren we expect to have a ten days' meeting ; so don't come expecting to stay in your wagons when comfortable tents can be rented so cheap, and the camp made neat and tidy. DAN T. JONES. -Łmay to themselves a discount well worth saving.should THE IOWA AND ILLINOIS CAMP-MEETINGS. AFTER careful consideration, it is decided that Elds. Littlejohn, 'Van Horn, and S. H. Lane, will attend the Illinois camp-meeting; while Eld. 0. A. Olsen, and myself, and possibly Eld. Cudney, with the ministers resident in the State, will at- tend the Iowa meeting. We hope there will be a large attendance at both. I expect also to be at the Northern Michigan and the Ohio meetings. GEO. I. BUTLER. Ł SPECIAL FOR ILLINOIS. . IN harmony with the suggestion of the President of the General Conference, we appoint Sabbath, Aug.  16 day of fasting and prayer for the Illi- , as a  nois Conference. The circumstances under which  we are placed at this time certainly demand that we afflict our souls, and in deep humility seek our God and his special blessing. The day of the Lord hastens. Agencies are being employed to militate against the cause of God. Many of our people are so engrossed with the cares of the world that spiritual things are dimly discerned, and the duties and dangers of the present are not realized. The prophet calls for a trumpet to be blown in Zion, and a fast proclaimed. The burden of our prayers be that God will send us men of his own choosing who shall bear terais:the message that is most needed; that we may awake 0411e duties and responsibilities of the present hour ;',.that we have aŁdeeper experience in the things of God; that we, may be sensible of sweet communion with Christ; and know that he reveals himself unto us as he does not unto the world; and that a signal blessing may be given at our camp-meeting, re-freshinu6  our souls and bringing many to Christ. The Lord will be found of all those that seek him intelligently with a contrite heart. We desire that all our people, on the day named, after having sought in secret prayer a spirit of humility and longing for God, shall repair to their several places of worship; and, after opening the meeting, let the leader, or some one who may be appointed, read to the congregation the article, " Our Camp-meet-ings," found in Testimony No. 31, pp. 158-163. Let the readinub  be followed by a prayer and social .meeting, in which all should take part. May the Lord give us a special preparation for our camp- meeting. R. F. ANDREWS. ALFRED HOBBS. Conf. Com.

W. H. LITTLEJOHN. _ . NORTHERN MICHIGAN CAMP-MEETING. AN APPEAL TO THE BRETHREN OF THIS DISTRICT. HAVING seen nothing in the REVIEW concerning our coming camp-meeting, and feeling a deep anx- iety that this important meeting should he well attended, I take the liberty to make this earnest appeal. This meeting will be held, as previously noticed, at Traverse City, Aug. 27 to Sept. 1. Traverse City is one of the oldest places in Northern Mich- igan, and its beautiful location on Traverse Bay, one of the finest sheets of water in the State, with its numerous groves of oaks and evergreens, and many other natural attractions, make it indeed a lovely place. The camp will be located near the city, aBarding a fine view of the Bay, and is acres- sible both by land and water. Reduced rates will be obtained on the railroads and also on the boats. Let no one say, I would like to go to the camp- DIST. NO. 4, OHIO. AT our last camp-meeting pledges were made to different missions. There is still over $200 unpaid in this district. Let those who can do so hand the same to me when I call on their societies; and let ' those at Clyde and Green Springs hand theirs to the State Secretary. By so doing it will help the cause in a time of need. H. D. CLARK, Director.
