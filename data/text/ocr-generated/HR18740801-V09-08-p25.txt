THE HEALTH REFORMER. 248 great events to children. For one day they feel they are heroes. The special puddings are made expressly for them; a new jacket, trow-sers with pockets, or the first pair of boots is donned, and big brothers and sisters sink into in-significance beside " little Charley," who is " six to-day," and is soon " going to be a man." Fa-thers who have half a dozen little ones to care for are apt to forget birthdaysŠthey come too often. Sometimes they are too busy, and some-times they are bothered ; but if they only knew how much such souvenirs are cherished by their children years afterwards, when away from the hearthstone they have none to remind them that they have added one more year to the perhaps weary round of life, or to wish them, in the good old-fashioned phrase, " many happy returns of their birthday," they would never permit any cause to step in between them and a parent's privilege.ŠSel. Household Duties. " DEARY me," says a would-be young lady, " if you are going to talk about anything so low and common as housework, I shall put my hands over my ears." Well, it would n't be a bad plan for you to have them there a portion of the time if you could also have them over your mouth and eyes Ł we should then hear less sense-less talkŠan index of the lack of ideas occa-sioned by light, trashy reading. Everywhere we see a growing dislike for manual labor. Much is said about the boys who leave their father's farms for some more genteel occupation in the city ; but how is it about the girls 4 Possibly the individuals who speak so disparagingly of this custom of young men, have never seen their sisters who left mother to bake, and wash, and churn, and went to the city as clerks in dry-goods stores, or those who remained at home for their mother to wait upon, while they took lessons on the piano, crochet, knit tatting, etc. But it is said that mothers mold the minds of their children. Can it be possible there are mothers so foolish as to teach their daughters that labor is degrading' Possibly. Not long since, a fond mother said, referring to her daughter, "I always felt as if she had too nice a turn of mind to do house-work ;" and another remarked, " I had almost as soon my daughters would be supported by the town as to have them go out doing house-work." Is it so very necessary, then, that clerks in dry-good stores, milliners, etc., should have fine minds, and so very appropriate that those des-tined to be " the light of home," to cook, and make, and mend, should be those who do not know whether Columbus or Washington dis-covered America, or whether New York is in England or Africa 1 The time has been when ladies of rank did not consider it beneath their dignity to assist in performing labor in the kitchen;and how was it with our great great granmothers Some of them were certainly noble types of womanhood. Imagine one of them, the year after the Mayflower came to Plymouth, coming to breakfastŠwhich she had done nothing about. preparingŠin muslin wrapper, and hair in in-finitesimal braids, preparatory to frizzing ; and then, after daintily sipping her chocolate, and fretfully saying, " There isn't anything fit to. eat," repairing to her room to dress for callers. Such pictures were not so plenty then as now. But do those who look with so much con-tempt upon life's common duties, and studiously avoid them, enjoy the lives they lead ? The most benevolent wish some are ever heard to make is that they might die, others are usually-in Giant Despair's cellar ; one might infer from their persistency in remaining there, that they preferred its gloomy apartments to the palace Beautiful. It is not extravagant display, but real worth,. which in moments of calm reflection commands the highest respect. When duty calls a young woman away from that dearest earthly spotŠhomeŠthe fondest recollections cluster around the memory of the grandmother who with white cap and black dress used to sit quietly knitting in the corner, and the patient mother with her basket of mending, as father reads the weekly paper, while the music teacher, who used to come day after day, with rings on half her fingers, and bracelets on her arms, and lisp. in an affected manner, is almost, if not entirely, forgotten. Away with the idea that it is unladylike to. perform household duties. The ladyhood that will not stand the test of dish-water, or soap-suds, and the rubbing board, if necessity requires,. is not the genuine article. " It is not the posi-tion that degrades the person, but the person who dignifies the position ;" and there is some-thing wrong about the head or heartŠor both Šof the young woman who thinks herself too. fine a lady to share the mother's labors in mak-ing home what it should be for her father and brothers. Life's most common every-day duties may be-invested with much of beauty if performed with right motives, from a loving heart, and with ready, willing hands. It will be time enough to live above the clouds when we are placed there. Sawdust and moonlight are both very good in their places, but do not form very sub-stantial food or clothing. Let us never lose sight of the fact that "Life is real! life is earnest !" "And ever endeavor while passing slug, To make it as smooth as we can." os..
