A DOCTOR'S CHATS. 253 TEMPERATURE FOR MORNING BATH Š KEROSENE AS A LINI-MENT, ETc.Š Mrs. E. R. asks the following questions : " 1. What temperature is best for a morning bath? 2. Would you recommend the use of soap at every bath ? 3. If so, what kind of soap ? 4. Will Glen Sulphur Soap cure skin diseases ? 5. Is the use of kerosene as a liniment for rheumatism, etc., injurious? 6. Is the use of tamarack, balsam of fir, and such gums in kidney difficulty beneficial or otherwise ? 7. Can catarrh be cured by the use of the nasal douche ? 8. Does a cancer upon the face, in its first stages, resemble a scab which is sore to the touch ?" Ans.ŠI. Seventy to eighty degrees, or cooler if reaction is strong. Our custom is to take the water just as it comes from the surface pipe. The cooler the water, the more vigorous is the Ł tonic effect. 2. No. 3. When soap is used, the best castile soap is as good as any. 4. This soap is doubtless to some degree antiseptic, and as some skiiseases are due to germs, it is to that extent beneficial. • 5. No. 6. Not to be recommended. 7. There are other means more valuable than the nasal douche. We recommend the Sanitarium Volatilizes. Address Sanitarium Supply Company. 8. Sometimes. THE USE OF MEATS AND CONDIMENTS.Š W. W. C. asks concerning the attitude of the Sanitaflum toward meats and con- diments ? Ł Ans.ŠThe attitude of the Sanitarium toward meats and con- diments is uncompromisingly hostile. CRANBERRIES.ŠR. B. H. asks: " What do you think of cranberries as an article of diet ? Should they be strained so as to remove all the skins ? " Ans.ŠWhen well cooked, cranberries are digestible. They are, however, so extremely acid as to require so large an amount of sugar that their use must be avoided by persons with sour or dilated stomachs. CATARRH OF THE LARYNX Š GOITER.Š MrS. H. wishes to know : " I. Is a constant accumulation of phlegm in the throat an indication of catarrh of the larnyx ? 2. If so, please give advice as to treatment ? 3. What is the best home treatment for goiter ?" Ans. I. Yes. 2. We recommend the use of the Sanitarium Volatilizer and the application of a cold pack at night. 3. The cold pack is good for goiter. Hot and cold applica-tions are beneficial. Galvanism is a valuable remedy. Some-times an operation is required. These cases cannot always be successfully treated at home. KENNEDY'S MEDICAL DISCOVERY.Š M. B. desires informa-tion regarding the composition of the above preparation, and also regarding its efficacy. Ans.ŠWe quote the following statement concerning the com-position of Kennedy's Medical Discovery from the " House-hold Monitor of Health," which gives the ingredients of a great number of patent nostrums :Š " According to King's American Dispensatory, this much advertised remedy consists of sneezewort 1 oz., bitter-root 4 dr., boiling water 8 oz., proof spirits to oz., licorice root 4dr., white sugar 4 oz., tinct. wintergreen I oz." HURTFULNESS OF BRAN AS A FOOD. J. E. H. writes as fol-lows : " It is claimed by some personsothat the bran from wheat is valueless as a food, and that it is even injurious, acting as an irritant to the stomach and bowels, producing congestion and per-haps inflammation. Also, that its continued use overstimulates and tires out the bowels, and so produces constipation. Is there any truth in the above statements? " Ans. ŠBran is not nutritious, but is valuable to give bulk to food which is necessary for the maintenance of health. .Bran is not injurious, except in cases of chronic inflammation or catarrh of the bowels, or an irritable stomach. Ł MOUTH BREATHING.ŠMrs. E. G. writes that her child, six years of age, has the habit of breathing with the mouth open when asleep, and asks : " What would you advise me to do for the purpose of correcting this habit ? " Ans. ŠSend 75 cents to the Sanitary Supply Company for a simple means by .which mouth breathing may be prevented. In , case a child cannot breathe through its nose, it should have treat-ment for nasal obstruction. BURNING OF THE FEET.ŠH. A. B. wishes to know if there is any remedy for burning of the feet. Ans.ŠThe alternate hot and cold footbath is a good remedy for burning of the feet. A bottle filled with cold water is a con-venient means for relief when the burning is particularly trouble-some at night. GRAPE SEEDS.ŠW. C. C. asks if the stones and skins of raisins and grapes are injurious, if well ground with the teeth before swallowing ? Ans.Š No. THE STRENGTHENING OF NERVES AND MUSCLES, ETC.ŠE. E. D. inquires : " 1. If nerves heal or strengthen by rest, and muscles grow or strengthen by exercise, how can each be treated without conflicting one with the other ? 2. Is it beneficial for  a weak person to give himself rubbings and kneadings, or should  a stronger person give them ?" Ans.-1. Exhausted muscles, as well as exhausted nerves, re-quire rest, but exhausted nerves as well as muscles require exer-cise to give them strength ; so in both cases we must have, for a complete cure, first rest, then work. 2. Yes ; but more benefit is derived when the rubbing and kneading is applied by another person, not because of any personal magnetism or influence communicated, but because it can be given more efficiently. ORIFICIAL SURGERY.ŠE. T., Penn., asks our opinion of orificial surgery as a cure for constipation. Ans.Š Orificial surgery is a fad. The average orificial surgeon finds a patient in every person who consults him. Some of the most obstinate cases of constipation we have been called upon to treat have been previously victims of so-called orificial surgeons. Hemorrhoids and other real maladies affecting the lower portion of the alimentary canal require suitable treatment, but it is the height of absurdity to treat the rectum for headache, neuralgia, insanity, consumption, and every ill that flesh is heir to. Con-stipation is much more frequently due to some disorder with which the rectum has nothing whatever to do, than to any ailment of this portion of the body.
