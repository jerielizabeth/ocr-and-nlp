EVANS. (Baroda, Mich.) " FOR. he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his." Heb. 4:10. Paraphrased, this passage would read, For the individual who has entered into God's rest has ceased from his own works as God did from his. By some this chapter is supposed to teach the observance of " another day," under the gospel dispensation, than the original Sabbath of the Lord. Is this a contro-versy upon the Sabbath question between one who was a Hebrew, who was blameless as teach-ing the righteousness of the law, and those of his own nation and sect? Or is it a treatise on the gospel, its blessings, and how they are to be enjoyed? In the first chapter of Hebrews a description of the position and work of Christ is given. The second chapter tells of his humiliation in human flesh, and what was, by it, secured to man. Then we with the Hebrews are asked to consider him who was faithful, and to take heed lest in any of us should be found "an evil heart of un-belief," for many of those to whom the gospel was first preached " could not enter in because of unbelief." According to the great commission, the bless-ings of the gospel are the reward of faith. The gospel " is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." The power of God in creation and redemption is the same, and the Sabbath is as closely connected with the one as with the other, with this difference ; of the former it is a memorial, and of the latter a sign. By the sinless it could only be observed as a me-morial ; by the redeemed sinner it must be ob-served as a memorial and a signŠ as a memorial of the exercise of God's power in creation, and as a sign of the exercise of the same power in recreation. The Creator rested, and in viewing his work, was refreshed, ; therefore he asked his people to remember the rest-day of the Lord, that they, by contemplating his power, might find in the day the rest and refreshment which he had placed there. But the memorial was forgotten, and man departed from the Lord. Later, the Saviour called Moses to lead his people out of Egypt, and gave him this consoling promise, " My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest." Ex. 33 : 14. "His pres-ence is salvation " (Ps. 42 : 5, margin) ; the gospel " is the power of God unto salvation ; " and the Sabbath is the sign of that power. Therefore the presence of Christ is in the Sabbath, and he who finds it there, enjoys the spiritual rest which God intended it should bring to man. " Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." But in order that we may receive the power of which the Sabbath is a sign, and enjoy the rest which the gospel brings to the weary, we must cease from our own works as God did from his ; trusting not in our own works for salvation (Titus 3: 5), but in him who is our righteousness. " The work of lighteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever." Isa. 32 : 17. " For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel ; In returning and rest shall ye be saved ; in quiet-ness and in confidence shall be your strength." Chapter 30 : 15. The strength, or power, of the Christian is God's, and to save man from being deceived on this point, the Lord has given him a sign by which he may know, or be assured that he is worshiping the true God. Ezek. 20 : 12. "There remaineth therefore a rest [" keeping of a Sabbath," margin] to the people of God." Heb. 4 : 9. BABYLON'S FALL. BY ELDER L. G. MOORE. (Lansing, Mich.) " BABYLON is fallen, is fallen." Such is the solemn message of the angel from heaven, as re- corded in Rev. 18 : 1-3. Have we reached the time spoken of ? I think so ; and as proof will quote from the notices of the professed church of Christ in this city : Š ,‚CIIiI,DREN'S GRAND CARNIVAL. " One hundred children in costume appear in the fan drill, Japanese parasol drill, handkerchief salute, blue vail drill, gun drill, frog drill, nursery gallop, besides in scenes, tableaux, and pantomimes, to-night at the chil-dren's carnival, at the First Baptist church. Do n't fail to see it. " One hundred children in full costume, at the chil-dren's carnival this week. Admission twenty-five cents ; children fifteen cents. " Come and see the froggies dance Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay,' at the carnival to-morrow night. " 'Four froggies,' will dance Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay,' to-night at the children's carnival. If you never laugh, stay away." How much of the Spirit of God accompanies such an exhibition ? Is this training the chil-dren in the way of holy living ? If they go to " the bad," who will be to blame ? Is this the church of God ? 'T is professedly so. Another specimen from the same church : -- " A highly entertaining and artistic musical event is in preparation, and will be presented at the new First Baptist church, on Wednesday evening, March 21. It is called 'Cradle Songs of the Nations.' The best local talent has volunteered for the occasion, and the music, costumes, and settings will be unusually fine. Messrs. Holmes and Christopher are to sing Our Baby Beats Them All,' at the ' Cradle Songs,' on Wednesday even-ing, and they '11 have the baby right with them. This is but one of the surprises in store for those who attend this rare evening of song and scene. Eve's lullaby will be sung in a garden that will rival Eden, and other startlingly realistic features await the fortunate holders of tickets." It will be noticed that Mother Eve and the garden of Eden are to be outdone. Some more from the same society-4'A Butterfly Social ":Š "Butterflies, butterflies, large and small, something that will please you all, some to sing and some to play, some will attend you while you dine, some will see you home at nine. First Baptist church, Saturday evening, March 10, 1894." In the Presbyterian church, their " wonderful revival " was followed by an entertainment- de-scribed as, -- " 'An evening of fun with, two orphans,' consisting of selections by A. H. Perry, impersonator, and W. H. May, humorist, will be given at the Franklin street Presbyterian church, to-morrow evening. These gen-tlemen come well recommended. Music will be fur-nished by the Millard quartet." As a rule, the world's people sympathize with the fatherless and motherless. The church en-joys the fun. Here is something for the disci-ples of John Wesley to think about : -- "BILL OF FARE AT THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCII FROG SUPPER, MAY 31, 1894. Frogs' legs fried in butter Sliced ham Veal croquettes Biscuit and butter Baked beans  Brown bread Forty cakes to select from Quail on toast to order. Price 15 cents. " Ice-cream will also be served. Good music in at-tendance. Good time expected. All are cordially in-vited. " The Methodist Episcopal church's frog-catcher is hav-ing great success, At the present writing over six hun-dred have been captured. A good supply will be on hand Friday evening, June 1, from 5 to 8 P. at. All are cordially invited. "Remember the boys' frog supper, at the Central Methodist Episcopal church, Friday, June 1, from 5 to 8 P. M. If you do n't like frogs, have quail on toast to order. Ice-cream will also be served." Here is something from Grand Rapids, Mich. : Š "Rag Babies' Ball given by the young people's society at the Park Congregational church to-night. Admission free. Refreshments 15 cents." " AND THE BAND PLAYED RAZZLE-DAZZLE. "The band played Razzle-dazzle,' andTthe Rag Babies' sang 'Jack and Jill,' in the parlors of thePark  Congregational church last evening. The Wagnerian treatment of the theme, and the Byronic beauty of the couplet, made an instantaneous hit with the audience. Just what classifications should be given Rag Babies' it is difficult to determine, possessing as it does some of the features of burlesque, grand opera, and farce comedy." " SUNDAY-SCHOOL DANCE. " A DECIDED INNOVATION IN OUR TIME-HONORED CUSTOMS. " Here is a genuine novelty a dancing party given by a Sunday-school. Cards have been issued by the young people of the Universalist Sunday-school, for a dancing and pedro party, to be given Wednesday even-ing, Feb. 17, at Custer Guard armory. The music will be by Braun's orchestra, and an enticing program has been arranged." There is no apology due for giving the names of the churches, since the above is their own pub-lication. And yet there is no occasion for sing-ling these of the great number of churches that do such things. It is passing strange that churches that claim to have been set as a light to the world should for a few dollars descend into the low walks of popular pleasure. " Lov-ers of pleasures more than lovers of God ; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof ; from such turn away." Do what ? " Turn away." HEAVEN. BY ALICE M. AVERY 'HARPER. (Vernon. Mieh.) WHAT a beautiful place amid the jasper -walls of the new Jerusalem and city of our God, our home in heaven will be. No pain, no sin, no sadness, no death in all that heavenly land ! The day of resting and eternal praise is about to dawn. Welcome, welcome that glad dayŠthe day of eternal praise ! Courage, weary pilgrim ! Soon the long, dark night of error will be past ; soon the weary will behold the promised reward, take possession of the kingdom, and with saints and martyrs join in one glad song of praise to the Crucified of Calvary ; soon God's own chosen ones will enter in through the gates of pearl to enjoy its unfading beauties throughout eternity. There is rest for the worn over on the other shore. Precious promise ! Rapturous thought ! No weary wasting of the frame in all that land ; no burial trains are there. There no mourners go about the streets." Eternal youth will adorn each child of God. Those who enter there are robed in light ; and peace and quietness will reign throughout that land of 'eternal praise. PEACE IN CHRIST. BY MARY STRATTON. (Hartland, Me.) Is it possible in this world of unrest, to have peace like a river and righteousness like the waves of the sea ? God's word assures this if we comply with the conditions. "In the world ye shall have tribulation," but in Christ, peace. If our hearts are full of complaining and mur-muring, and we are calling the burden heavy, and the Lord a hard master, the world can most assuredly claim us. But if we have peace that the world can neither.give' nor take away all along life's journey, then it is Christ. Offenses must come, but having been forewarned, when they reach us, they fail to offend. Our earthly pros-pects may all be blighted, the world become a blank from which we can desire no happiness ; still God will be our sure refuge, and the peace remain. Under every circumstance the promise holds good, "All things work together for good to them that love God." We may not fully un-derstand God's providences, but we can trust-ingly look forward for a satisfactory solution of all our difficulties, and rest on the thought that God in his great love for his children, will do all things well. In the thickening perils of the last days, he will give his beloved peace here,; and by and by everlasting peace in his-kingdom. Ł
