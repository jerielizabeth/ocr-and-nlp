Otsego, Mich., July 10, 1864. . ionable sins ; for if you do, you condemn the works of others; and that is uncharitable. " Charity covereth a multitude of sins." Their definition of charity would be, to " Cover up all the sins you can, whether repent- ed of or not; coax the Devil to do as little evil as pos- sible." Peace, peace ! this is charity, religion, holi- ness, everything ! This has been preached so long that all the teachings of the churches summed up would read, "Conform to the world as much as you can, thus making peace." He who violates this truce of peace, say they, is uncharitable. But what is charity? The following from the Hand- Book of the New Testament, p. 136, is to the point : "Charity, from the exalted position which St. Paul has given it among the Christian virtues, has frequent- ly been perverted in its application, and placed in op- position to truth. But the proverb says, 'Truth is the greatest charity;' and as charity aims, or should aim, at the welfare of mankind, and as the welfare of man is inseparably involved in their reception of, and ad-herence to the truth, it follows that that which is most true must be the most charitable." This is the correct meaning of charity. If you see a person indulging in error or wickedness, tell him of it, and warn him of its consequences if persisted in, In short, be bold to speak the truth and reprove wrong at all times. So St. Paul taught. " Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth." 1 Cor. xiii, 6. Will they accuse St. Paul of being uncharita- ble ? Hear him again : "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, (accursed)." 1 Cor. xvi, 22. Remember that this is the same apos- tie who has just been extolling charity so highly in chap. xiii. John, the apostle of love, thus expresses his charity for those who willfully reject the gospel : "If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed." Listen to Stephen, filled with the Holy Ghost, as he talks out his charity for those who had rejected Jesus, and were now persecuting his followers : " Ye stiff- necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do al- ways resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers ; who have re- c the law by the disposition of angels and have  not kept it." Hear Jesus himself as he expresses his charity for the fashionable professors of his time, the scribes and Pharisees: "Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and hcnoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Here, then, we have examples of Christian charity. Now, whom shall we follow ? Shall we hold our peace when we see the false shepherds leading the people astray ? When we see them with their eyes blinded by the smoke of their burning sacrifice to their tobac- co god, their brain dizzy with the wine of Babylon, and themselves breaking the law of God, and teaching others to sin, shalt we be "dumb dogs" when we know that the wolves are tearing the flock ? No, nev- er ! But we will " cry aloud and spare not." But, says one, The sheep themselves don't like to be rescued. So with the man who is nearly overcome with cold ; his senses are all benumbed, his reason gone, and be wishes to lie down in the snow to indulge, as h e thinks, in sweet dreams. If he is permitted to do so he must inevitably perish. Now, we ask the ad- vocates for peaceable charity, what shall be done in this case ? Let him perish for fear of incurring his displeasure ? Or shall we use every means in our power to arouse him, let him feel and talk as he may ? Judge ye. The command to the faithful watchman is, "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trum- pet, and shew my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins." This is true charity to show a man his danger and arouse him to a sense of his condition. That charity which would hold its peace while a man was destroying himself, is a false charity. We must ever remember that " Truth is the greater charity." So then, brethren, if you love your neighbors, and would be charitable to them, cease not to warn them at all times, whether they will bear or forbear. If you succeed in awaking them to their danger, they will with gratitude acknowledge that you exercised toward them true Christian charity. D. M. CANRIGHT. Note from Bro. Snook. TO ALL THE DEAR BRETHREN AND SISTERS WHO HAVE ASSISTED ME TO PAY FOR My HOME: Permit me, my brethren and sisters, to acknowledge your kindness through the Review, and to say that my home is paid for, and that my notes and mortgage, held by Bro. White, have been redeemed. I return to you my most hearty thanks; and to my dear Bro. White, who has aided me so very much, I return most grateful thanks, and confess myself under many obligations, and hope that I may ever live in such a way that the cause I love may never suffer by me. B. F. SNoox. Interesting Extracts. No. 4. Š. BY ELD. M. E. CORNELL.  THE following extracts are from Prof. Stuart on Prophecy, as published in the Biblical Repository in A. D. 1832. Some of his remarks appear to be in- trestin e g and according to truth. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE PROPHETS. "I agree as to the fact, that the heathen seers were  rightly named papretc, from ualvouat, to rave; as Cicero has declared in his first book De Divinatione. But what an immeasurable distance, now, between a raving man or woman, uttering incoherent sentences ; or (which was more common) a dissimulating hypocrite, uttering cunningly and artfully and equivocally con-structed sentences and poetic riddles ; and a Hebrew prophet, animated by the strongest and deepest feelings of reverence for Jehovah, and a holy ardour in the cause of true piety ! is there ambiguity, flattery, self- seeking, enigmas, in the message of the latter ? None. Are not all these stamped on more or less of the heath- en oracles? They are. And such being the case, we would separate the Hebrew prophet from the heathen seer, not by discrepancies of a mere physiological or psychological nature, which lie beyond our ken in case they exist at all; or rather, which involve contradic-tions and impossibilities ; but bye rational, enlighten-ed, holy, excited, zealous state of mind, which raised the true seer unspeakably above all false ones, and did this by making him in a high degree like to the Author of his inspiration. Here is something palpable. The oracles speak for themselves. The ambiguities, enig- mas, swelling words, polytheistic precepts, and other like things, contained in heathen oracles, are a palpa-ble contrast to the Scriptures ; but they are not more so, than the condition of their seers was discrepant from that of the Hebrew prophet." THE ALLEDGED OBSCURITY OF THE PROPHETS DISPROVED. "What is prophecy?  That part of it with which we are now concerned is prediction. And what is prediction ? It is the foretelling of certain things which are to happen ; it is a revelation made through men, to men, respecting future things ; a declaration that certain events will take place. Now what is a declaration or revelation? If this be unintelligible, both to him who utters it, and to those who are ad-dressed by him ; if neither he, nor they, nor any one who comes after them, is able to explain the meaning of this revelationŠand this because it is in itself ob-score and unintelligibleŠin what tolerable sense can this be called a revelation? 1 admit that a multitude of causes might hinder wicked and carnal and ignorant men, from understand- ing what the prophets uttered. Prejudice, want of be- ing conversant with spiritual things, passion, and many other causes might interpose, and effectually prevent the carnal Jews from rightly comprehending the oracles of their prophets. But to say that neither the prophets themselves, nor the intelligent and pious men of their times and of succeeding generations, were able to understand what God had given them for the very purpose of making a revelation to themŠwhat is this but to say, that the purposes of the divine Spirit had been frustrated, for want of perspicuity in the language which he employed? And can we soberly maintain this? Either God did design to reveal something to his people, when he in- spired the prophets, or he did not. If he did ; then his design is frustrated, just so far as the prophecy is in itself unintelligible ; and how can we admit that the designs of the Holy Spirit should be frustrated? If he did not ; then what is prophecy but illusion ; a seem-lag to make a revelation, while in fact none is made, or even intended to be made ?" . Note from Bro. Sanborn. I HAVE now preached at Pleasant Grove sixteen times to attentive congregations. Last Sabbath, three were baptized and received into the church ; and in the evening we attended to the ordinances, and enjoyed much of the divine blessing promised by the Saviour to his people on such occasions. One more is waiting to be baptized, and others who are interested, we trust, will decide soon. The brethren begin to see the importance of a more determined effort to arise and gird on the whole armor, that they may quench all the fiery darts of Satan and his evil.host. May the Lord help them to overcome, is my prayer. ISAAC SANDogN, Pleasant Grove, Minn. Quarterly Meeting in wig. Bite. WHITE : bur Quarterly Meeting at Avon, Rock Co., Wis., has just closed. Many of the brethren that lived here have moved away, and the church is be- coming somewhat scattered, yet nearly all are firm in the truth. This meeting was well attended, and was one of profit and we trust interesting to all. We had no messenger, but the deep, heart-felt, and cheering prayers and testimonies from the brethren and sisters were such as tell of the spirituality of the church in this place. And although pestilence is in the land, and the wheat crop is genearlly nearly all destroyed, the brethren can look up and bless God ; for they can read on all sides, signs of the soon coming of the Son or man. JOSEPH G. WOOD. Brodhead, Wis. Ł True and False Charity. SUNDAY, June 26, Bro. Lawrence gave a discourse on the duty to preach the Word, and in showing why it was necessary so to do, of course he had to expose the popular sins of the time, both of the world and the professed church. When he had finished, a minister, who said that he represented the NI. E. Church, arose, and began to cry for " charity." After calling Bro. L. a hypocrite, an ignoramus, &c., he concluded thus : "You are all the time talking about the corruption in the churches. This isn't a Christian spirit. If you would have a little charity for others you would do much better." Then up jumped another one and echoed back, " Why can't you have a little charity ; " and thus he continued to sound upon that delightful word " chari- ty." Neither of them, however, pretended to deny the statements made in regard to the fallen condition of the churches. Indeed, the Methodist man, the next day, while in private conversation with me, acknowl- edged that it was all true. Still they plead for "char- ity, charity." Now, this is no new thing to us ; for wherever we go and begin to expose the popular sins of professors, the first thing we hear is the stale cry for charity. What do they mean by this ? They simply mean this : You must keep still; you must not expose these fash- s....lt
