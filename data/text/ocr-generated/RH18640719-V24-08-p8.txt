BATTLE CREEK, MICR., TRIRD-DAY, JULY 19. 1864. jaar THE FALL OF BABYLON.ŠWe are sometimes accused of being very severe in our exposition of the second angel's message of Rev. xiv, and especially in applying the term Babylon to the popular churches of the land. But there is nothing reproachful in the term Babylon. It is only a name expressive of a great fact which is apparent to every one, namely, that the different religious creeds of the Protestant sects of the day, as compared with each other, are all " mixture" and "confusion." The trouble after all is, in the fall. And if any think we are too severe in this respect, let them read the extract from the sermon of E, Bowen, given in another column, who deals with this subject in as strong language as any S. D. Adventist has ever presumed to use. Ste' Ix that organ of Spiritualism, The Herald of Progress, published by A. J. Davis and Co., we find the first announcement of the death of the son of J. C. Jackson of " Our Home," Dansville, N. Y. E. P. D. We think that a "neighbor" in the Christian sense, is determined by the same rule that Christ gave in Matt. xii, 50, to determine who was his brother and sister and mother; namely, whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven. par Last week we erased from our lists the names of ninety subscribers, who had not paid up to Vol. xxii. Many of these will pay up and renew their sub- scription. J. W. OW' It makes one feel strangely sometimes to have their paper stopped simply because they do not pay up. But some have to be jogged in this way before they can wake up and pay their debts. It would be much more pleasant for us and them if they were prompt. J. W. ger Next week we shall erase the names of those who have not paid up to Vol. xxiii. J. W. Ili We wish to send the Review to all who read it with interest and profit, whether they pay full price, half price, or receive it free. J. W. Several hundreds of our subscribers were marked free. Most of these are being erased, as the cost of stock and labor demands full pay, with the ex-ceptions of a few hundreds at half-price, to meet ex- penses. J. W. SEr Let the worthy poor have the paper! How? Ans. Churches and brethren can send in their names, with one dollar each for the paper, one year. But let the names come in, money or no money, of all who should have it. Then let the brethren donate for the Review to the poor sufficient to pay up for all who cannot pay themselves, and for those not paid for by personal friends. J. W. star We received the following from Western New York : " Inclosed find $10. Five I send for Review to the poor, and five A. H. 0. sends for the same pur-pose." These young men have set a good example for others. This will furnish the Review to ten families for one year. J. W. 4E632- Two thousand dollars are wanted to sustain the Eastern Mission. We claim the pleasure of giving twenty-five dollars of this sum. Receipts in this di- rection have been light recently. J. W. lam  What an excellent time to take shares in the Publishing Association ! Brethren and sisters who have not taken stock, will never find a better time. If you want information relative to this matter, send for pamphlet containing Constitution and By-laws of the Association. Your help is needed in these times of high prices, while our publications generally stand at former low prices. Whatever may be the times, hard or easy, God's work must move on. A few thou- TILE unscriptural doctrine of the eternal conscious suffering of the wicked has been a source of trouble and perplexity to many minds. We gather from an exchange the following respecting Dr. Cumming : "Ise his excellent work, 'The last of the Patri-archs,' Dr. Cumming gives vent to his feelings in rela-tion to the sufferings of the lost. The second chapter, page 41, relates to the laws of God, and the obedience of Joseph to the law under temptation. lie then speaks of the holiness of the law and its terrible penalty to the transgressor, and adds: 'The only part of the Bible that ever perplexes meŠabout which, however we may rest satisfied that what we know not now, we shall know hereafterŠis that which tells us that there is one nook in this grand universe where there shall be the wail of ceaseless sufferings, and the poison of irre-mediable sin. That is the most painful revelation in all God's word. One could wish, in our present unenlight-ened state, that it were not so," How much better to have a theory which by taking God as he says, and the Bible as it reads, avoids all these painful features, and gives us a consistent ground of faith to stand upon now, and a clean universe in the future.
