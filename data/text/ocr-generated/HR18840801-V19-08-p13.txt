TRIUMPHAL ARCHES. Spanning the highest point of the ancient Via Sacra, which leads from the capitol to the southern gate of the city, the route by which triumphal processions passed to the temple of Jupiter, rises the magnificent Arch of Titus, constructed of Grecian marble, and erected A. D. 70, to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem. Of all the gala days of ancient Rome, those on which the victories of successful generals and commanders were celebrated, were unparalleled in splendor and jubilation. Pageantry was a special feature of the occasion ; especially were the spoils of war and the trains of chained cap-tives paraded before the eyes of the people; and so we read that upon the occasion of the return of Titus from the war with the Jews, a hun-dred thousand captives, with sad, despairing faces, followed the train of the proud conqueror, bearing the most holy treasures of the temple at JerusalemŠthe great golden candlesticks, the silver trumpets, and other sacred utensilsŠas trophies of the conquest. Upon one side of the interior of the imposing arch erected to com-memorate this triumph, is traced in wonderful has-relief, a representation of this triumphal procession, with the captive Jews, the table of shew-bread, and golden candlesticks, incense vessel, and jubilee trumpets,copied in all proba-bility from the originals. On the opposite side is a relievo of the emperor, Titus, seated in a triumphal car, attended by Victory, who is in the act of crowning him with laurels. To this day no Jew will pass under this arch, but turns aside with averted countenance, and in detesta-tion spits upon it as he passes by. Rome abounds in triumphal arches; hut one erected in commemoration of the victory of Constantine over Maxentius at the Ponte Molle in 311, when Constantine declared himself in favor of Christianity, which spans the Via Tri-urnphalis, is said to exceed in magnitude any other triumphal arch in existence. It has three passages, but its delicately cut bas-reliefs and decorations, which were plundered from an arch originally erected in honor of Trajan, contrast strongly with the rude additions made in the time of Constantine. THE MARMERTINE PRISON. In connection with the triumphal arches, one can hardly help but think of the Marmertine Prison, the terrible place to which, as the tri-umphal processions began to ascend the capitol-ine hill, the most illustrious of the captives were led aside, and in its dark, damp dungeons doomed to die. It is one of the oldest structures in Rome, and consists of two vaults, one above another, the lower of which was originally reached only through a circular opening, or  "man-hole," in the stone floor. This lower chamber is ten feet wide, nineteen in length, with a height of less than seven feet, of which the historian Sallust says, " Its uncleanliness, its darkness, and its noisome smell, make it in-deed a truly disgusting and terrible abode." Here Jugurtha, king of Manritania, was starved to death ; here the accomplices of Cataline were strangled ; here Vercingetorix, the enemy of Caesar, suffered, and Simon Bar Gidras, the last defender of Jerusalem ; and here it is tradition places the scene of the apostle Paul's final im-prisonment, and where it is believed he addressed his immortal farewell to the Christian world. If this be the identical place, we wonder not that the damp, chill atmosphere of the dungeon made the apostle feel the need of the cloak which he had left at Troas. The papal legends assert that St. Peter, too, was imprisoned here, and that a spring of water which we saw in the floor of the lower cell burst forth miraculously to furnish water for the bap-tism of one of the jailors converted through his instrumentality. NATURE'S GRAND ENTERTAINMENT. FAIR Nature comes out with her annual pageants In the field, in the wood, by the highway side; The birds are her volunteer traveling agents, They sound her advertisements far and wide. The wide-spreading sky is her grand pavilion, Whose blue she nightly gems over with stars; Her vocal musicians she counts by the million; No discord her entertainment mars. She wears her gorgeous midsummer dresses Of purple and violet, crimson and gold; Bright flowers she wears in her sunny tresses; The wealth of her diamonds cannot be told. She spreads out her carpets of crimson clover, Her violet-embroidered robe she wears; With her cloudy lace curtains floating above her, What queen with our wildwood queen compares? Oh, come from the smoke-scented air of the city, On the soft lap of Nature your weary head rest; She waits to enfold you with soft arms of pity, Like a child on its mother's own cherishing breast. She stands at her flowery threshold to meet you. Come, breathe her sweet odors distilling so free. Her roses and lilies are smiling to greet you; Her choir chants a welcome to you and to me. Come out, drooping friends, ere the season is over; She woos you with music and landscapes most rare ; Come, kneel at her feet, her companion and lover, Drink gladness and health in her lifegiving air.
