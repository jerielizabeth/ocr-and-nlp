voice the sentiments of a large majority of the liquor-dealers of this city and Brooklyn, in saying we dare Archbishop Corrigan to enforce in letter and spirit the decree against the liquor traffic, just issued by Mgr. Satolli, the papal delegate. Let the archbishop do it, and watch the consequences." To this very spirited and unequivocal letter the archbishop replied in the following words :-- "New York, July 28, 1894. "Editor Wine and Spirit Gazette,Š " Sir: Returning to town yesterday I found on my desk a copy of your journal of July 25. In reply to your expressed wish, I have the honor to say that I loyally accept the principles laid down by his excellency Mgr. Satolli, both in their spirit and to the letter. More than this, no Catholic can refuse to accept them. As to the fear of the consequences, I have yet, thank God, to learn what fear is in the discharge of my duty. - Please to remember, however, that acceptance of principles is not to be confounded with the blind application of the same, on all occasions and under all circumstances. "Respectfully, "M. A. Corrigan, Abp." And that is to say that the archbishop accepts the principle, but he will carry it out only when and where he thinks it best and politic to do so ! Really, the last part of his letter practically nullifies the grandiloquent statement of loyalty to Satolli and to the cause of temperance with which his letter begins. The editor of the Wine and Spirit Gazette very properly declares that the archbishop's letter does not touch the spot, and that it is only a skillful evasion of the question. The application of the principles of temperance as they are understood at the pres-ent time is a new thing for Catholics ; hence a reform of this radical character will necessarily proceed very slowly ; and the probability that Catholics will within a short time confine them-selves to milk and water for drinking purposes, seems at this writing to be very remote. M. E. K. SUNDAY LAWS IN ENGLAND. [THE following from the Chicago Record will be of interest to our readers. The question of Sunday observance is coming to the front every- where. Š ED.] Ł 4' The Lord's Day Observance Society recently won a barren victory at Leeds, England. It appears that Mr. Wilson, an ex-mayor of the city, and his associate, Mr. Ward, leased a hall, known as the Coliseum, and arranged a series of secular and entertaining lectures under the au-spices of the local Sunday society, of which Mr. Wilson is president. The first lecture was by Mr. Villiers, the war correspondent, on his ex-periences at the Columbian Exposition, with lime-light illustrations ; and the second by Max 0 'Rell, on "John Bull, Sandy, and Pat." At this juncture, Mr. Henry Reid, a member of the Lord's Day Obervance Society, brought suit against the lessees, under an old statute passed more than a hundred years ago, in the reign of George III., for permitting and organizing a public entertainment on Sunday. The court in-structed the jury that it must find the defendants guilty under this obsolete act of Parliament, and then proceeded to deliver a scathing denunciation of the law which it was compelled to administer. The jury reluctantly brought in a verdict of guilty, and added a rider to it in favor of the repeal of the act in question. Thus an ex-mayor of one of the most important cities in the kingdom was fined $500, and classed in the same category as the keeper of a bagnio, to sat-isfy the bigotry of a handful of persons who were aided by an obsolete statute. The prosecu-tion, however, may have the good effect of wip-ing out the silly act ; for the day has passed, even in England, when it is longer considered possible to make men moral by act of Parlia-ment." AUGUST 21, 1894r ADVENT RATITEW AND SABBATH HERALD. 535 THE insanity of the policy which inaugurates and prosecutes such destructive episodes as the late strike, becomes more and more apparent as we observe and experience its inevitable conse-quences. Fire is recognized as a destructive agent. That which it consumes is gone forever. War, too, is a wasting desolation. Equally so with either are these senseless struggles in which one portion of the community seeks to destroy and lay waste those interests in which the welfare of both parties is mutual. The railways of the United States pay on an average more than sixty per cent of their operat-ing expenses to their laboring men directly ; . and a very large share of the remainder to other la-boring men indirectly. Three fourths of their enormous expenses go to the working-men. It is easy to see where the force of the blows struck at the railways must finally rest. The earnings of the railways during the six months just passed show a very great loss. One fifth of the railway corporations have passed into the hands of re-ceivers during the past year. If we can believe official reports, it is with our great railway sys-tems at present a struggle for existence. What about the wisdom of the employees who are do-ing their utmost to add to the great financial de-pression under which they are struggling? This question is not asked out of pity for the corpora-tions, but out of regard for the interests of the many thousands to whom the railroads are the sole reliance for a livelihood. The London Times fitly says that Debs and his coadjutors have done as much to harm the industries of America in a week, as the Confed-erate armies did in a month." These injuries are inflicted upon the laborers. The laboring classes need the continued sympathy and support of public sentiment. And the sense of good people is decidedly in their favor, until the course they adopt becomes devoid of sense, suicidal, and lawless. At that point right-minded people withdraw their approbation. We disown any partisanship in these mat-ters. To our mind the solution of the difficulty is in keeping out of it. The gospel of truth and peace furnishes ample employment and incentive to Christian hearts and hands. We would gladly see all who profess the principles of this gospel wholly animated by them. G. C. T. "To amend the Constitution in relation to hours of labor. "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following amendment to the Constitution of the United States be proposed to the legislatures of the several States, which, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution of the United States: Š same footing. No outdoor preaching or pro-cessions are allowed, so we can have no Salvation Army in MexicoŠthe law forbids; and no uniform is permitted in the streets, except to the police and soldiers." THE following joint resolution was introduced in the United States Senate on the 17th ult. :Š ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING AT IT. THE REBOUND OF THE STRIKE. Cm " JOINT RESOLUTION ,A111 " 'Eight hours shall constitute a legal day's work for persons doing manual labor. No person, association, or corporation engaged in mining, manufacturing, or in any other mechanical pursuit or public work, or in transportation other than watercraft, shall require or permit any employee doing manual labor to work for such person, association, or corporation more than forty-eight hours in one week, except in cases of emergency prescribed by law. Persons voluntarily and lawfully engaged in any of the above pursuits shall not be un-lawfully hindered or obstructed. " Congress shall enforce this provision by appro-priate legislation.' " Ostensibly this movement favors an eight-hours' working day, and is in behalf of laboring people. So far it is all right. For from the observation we have had of the practical working of the eight-hour rule in Australia, where it is fully accepted, we are favorably im-pressed, and would favor its adoption by mutual consent of employer and employee. But in this move we discover more than that. Forty-eight hours a week means six days of eight hours each. The ardent friends of Sunday-by-law being re-pulsed in their attempt to carry their point by direct assault choose this indirect way in which to accomplish their end. Congress, in order to "enforce this provision by appropriate legisla-tion," would necessarily limit labor to six days a week ; so the second and inevitable step would be to separate Sunday by legal enactment from the six working days. Congress is too far gone for this session (so let us hope), to act niacin this measure ; but it shows the prevailing and growing spirit of the times. G. C. T. CATHOLICS AND THE LIQUOR BUSINESS. THE recent decision of Mgr. Satolli in regard to Catholics selling liquor has stirred up much Comment everywhere. It should be understood that this decision of Satolli was simply the enforc-ing, by his authority as the American apostolic legate, a former decision rendered by Bishop Watterson. That decision is not nearly as strong as many think it is. The following extract from Bishop Watterson's decision will show his idea of regulating the liquor traffic : Š "If there are saloon-keepers in your parish who call themselves Catholics and yet carry on their business in a forbidden and disedifying way, or sell on Sundays, either openly or under any guise or disguise, in violation of civil law, and to the hurt of order and religion and the scandal of any part of the community, you will refuse them absolution, should they perchance come to receive the sacraments, unless they promise to cease offending in these or other ways, and to conduct their business blamelessly if they can, or get out of it and keep out of it altogether." It will be seen by the above that as long as a Catholic does not sell liquor on a Sunday, and does not carry on his business in a " disedifying way," he is all right ! It is not perfectly clear to a person uninitiated in the mysteries of the liquor traffic, how that soul-and-body-destroying business may be carried on in a way to edify any one ; but probably the priests of Rome, who draw such large sums of money from the Catholic liquor-dealers, will be able to formulate some rule by which it may be done ! The extent to which the power of that church will be used to prevent Catholics from selling liquor is further shown by a controversy between the editor of the Wine and Spirit Gazette and Archbishop Corrigan, of New York. Comment-ing on the decision of Bishop Watterson, and its confirmation by Satolli, the editor said : Š "Fully two thirds if not more of the retail liquor-dealers of the country are Roman Catholics. Some of these are liberal contributors to church funds. . . We
