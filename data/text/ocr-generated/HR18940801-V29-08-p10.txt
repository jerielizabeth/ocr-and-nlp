230 GENERAL HYGIENE. and consequently nurses trained in such hospitals do not always have an opportunity for acquiring thorough familiarity with these remedial means. This deficiency is certainly very largely compen-sated for by the superior opportunities offered by the experience and training in the treatment of emergency cases of various sorts. Notwithstanding, the hospital trained nurse, when she leaves the supervision of her instructors and starts out upon an independent career as a trained nurse, often finds herself longing for a more thor-oughly furnished armamentarium in her battle with disease and suffering in district and private nursing. A well-equipped sanitarium, provided with ample facilities for the administration of every form of hydropathic measures ; for the use of electricity in every form ; for the utilization of massage, Swedish movements, Swedish gymnastics, and the various forms of physical culture ; mechanical appliances for active and passive exercise ; diet kitchens and surgical wards with every facility for aseptic sur-gery, and for the application of all rational hy-gienic, as well as medicinal and mechanical agen-cies in the treatment of medical and surgical cases, is certainly an ideal place for the training of the nurse for working in the private home, in district nursing, and, in fact, wherever her lot may be cast. The course of training in such a school necessarily includes not only the subjects usually taught in hospital training schools, but theoretical and practical instruction in the therapeutics of water, electricity, massage, manual and mechanical Swedish movements, medical dietetics, scientific cookery, and a thorough course in exercise and physical culture. My experience has been that nurses appreciate the last-named feature as much as any other portion of such a course of training. The personal advantages which the nurse derives from the possession of strength, enduring muscles, perfect digestion, capacious lungs, a strong waist, a back that never aches, an elastic step, a dignified, graceful, and energetic bearing, are beyond estimate. The training in physical culture, massage, and Swedish movements gives the nurse full command of all the advantages to be derived from measures of treatment which operate through the muscular sys-tem in the treatment and cure of disease, and en-ables her to accomplish in many cases for her pa-tient what cannot be accomplished by drugs or by any other means. The resources afforded by electricity, especially the galvanic and faradic currents, are not at the full command of a nurse unless she has had months of daily experience in its use, and has learned well its potency and modes of application to the great variety of morbid conditions to which it is adapted. She must know more than this; she must have learned so well the secret of the battery by which the current is produced, whether faradic or galvanic, that in case the instrument fails to work (which it is quite likely to do when it is needed most), she can give it the magical touch which will unlock its potent forces ; or, if need be, she may construct out of the raw material a battery capable of accomplishing useful results. Sanitariums afford a specially favorable field for the study and application of medical dietetics. The absence of a regulation diet makes it possible to adapt the bill of fare to the needs of each indi-vidual patient with a degree of accuracy which cannot be attempted under less favorable condi-tions. Facilities for analysis of stomach fluids and other secretions give a basis for the exact study of the dietetic needs of patients, which affords the nurse educational advantages of no small value. But perhaps the most practical advantages of all derived by the nurse from training in a well-equipped and scientifically organized sanitarium, are derived from the daily and hourly experience in the use of hydropathic measures of every description. Water is a simple remedy which is universal, and is a most convenient means of utilizing those' most potent of therapeutic measures, heat and cold, which act upon the central nervous system, and through it upon the whole body, in a manner little less than mar-velous. The nurse who is able to take the result of such a course of training into the home, into her work as a district nurse, or to a foreign field as a missionary nurse, is equipped for work of the high-est usefulness, and feels a confidence in meeting every form of human malady not to be derived from any less thoroughgoing system of training. In the sanitarium, private hospital, and home, the nurse has the further advantage of an opportunity for the more exact treatment and study of her cases than in ordinary public hospital work, in conse-quence of the smaller number of patients usually placed under the care of each individual nurse. In well-organized private sanitariums, patients who re-quire nursing usually receive the whole attention of a single nurse, and sometimes of two nurses, one for the day, the other for the night. The application of so large a variety of measures of treatment gives the nurse abundance of work to do, even in caring for a single patient, and one which might not be considered of the most critical class, as for example, ≈Å
