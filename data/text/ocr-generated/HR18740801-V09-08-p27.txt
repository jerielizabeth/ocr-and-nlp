We will conclude this article by presenting a table showing the proportions of nitrogenous, carbona-ceous, and mineral elements, in some of the most common articles of food. It has been chiefly compiled from Dr. Edward Smith's excellent work on " Foods." The following table shows the number of parts of each element in a hundred parts of the whole substance :- Water.

WE often hear hygienists speaking of an im-poverished diet, and of the evils which result from such an undesirable thing. Upon endeavoring to ascertain what is meant by a diet characterized as impoverished, we are met by a wide diversity of descriptions. One person declares that an im-poverished diet is one which excludes all flesh food of any description. Another thinks that the term should be applied to a dietary which does not in-clude butter, milk, or eggs. Still another indi-vidual considers the prohibition of spices, salt, and other condiments as the chief characteristic of an impoverished diet. While others regard the liberal use of sugar, in its many forms, as quite necessary to save a system of dietary from the imputation of impoverishment. Among such a host of conflicting notions, how shall we decide this very interesting question ? Let us frame a definition for the term, and in so doing we shall solve the difficulty. An impover-ished diet must be one which makes impoverished blood. The blood can become impoverished in only one way, viz., by being deprived of some of the elements of nutrition. Then food which does not contain all of the elements necessary to supply all the wants of the body, to repair the wasted tissues and renovate the worn ones, will surely render the blood deficient in some of its essential constituents, and so impoverish it. It may be  possible, also, that although an aliment contains all of the necessary elements, they are in such a form or condition that they cannot be utilized by the system. The effect would be identically the same as though those elements were wholly lack-ing. We may say, then, as a definition or description of an impoverished diet, that it is one which does not furnish to the system a sufficient amount of the proper material to nourish and sustain the body. Owing to peculiarities of constitution and condition, as the result of disease or education, it often occurs that the bill of fare which is fully adequate to supply all the wants of one individual may be deficient in some particulars as food for another. Hence, we cannot describe a fixed, in-flexible dietary which must be invariably followed by every person ; we can only state general prin-ciples and leave each person to work out by in-telligent reasoning and observation, his own die-tetic regimen. But we must not omit to call attention to the many erroneous views which are entertained with reference to the nutritive value of certain articles of diet. Those who think their systems need but-ter, should remember that it is wholly unnecessary as food, being nothing more than a condiment. The same must be said of salt, spices, and even of sugar in any but very small quantities. All the real nutriment of our food is contained in the wheat, potatoes, corn, apples, and other fruits, grains, and vegetables which we eat. How, then, can a person be said to be subsisting upon an im-poverished diet when he has an abundance of such nourishing articles of food as graham bread, oatmeal pudding, delicious foreign and domestic fruits, and  a  score of other healthful aliments ? Certainly, none of the elements of nutrition are lacking, and they are all presented in an uncon-taminated state, wholly free from adulteration with irritating and indigestible condiments ; and, consequently, it cannot be urged that they are not in a condition to be easily and readily assimilated. It is doubtless true, however, that there is such a thing as an impoverished diet among health reformers. Who are living upon this kind of a diet, we will tell in the succeeding article upon making the change in diet. How to Make the Change in Diet. THIS is an interesting question to all who are really desirous of becoming thorough reformers. It is especially interesting, inasmuch as it has been the occasion of much discussion and diversity of opinion. A certain class of reformers say, Re-nounce at once and forever every article of diet not in strict harmony with the teachings of hy-giene. Another class of more liberal individuals advocate a gradual change. They say, Renounce your bad dietetic habits by degrees. Which is
