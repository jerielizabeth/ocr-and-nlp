AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 475 one hundred and fifty students, at an expense of about $35,000 including the land. Other buildings have been arranged, where students who attend the school can learn some one of six useful trades. This does not include gardening and the culinary department, etc. It is now expected that these buildings will be completed so that their dedication will be held thti first of October, at which time the fall term will com-mence, making a delay of a few weeks on ac-count of the buildings not being completed. The expenses at the South Lancaster Acad-emy are light in comparison with other schools, the entire expense including board and tuition not exceeding $3.50 per week. The True Educator, an eight-page sheet, is published monthly by the Academy, the type-setting, proof-reading, and press work all being done by those connected with the school. Those boarding at the Academy have advantages in the matter of tuition and learning trades not offered to others. A specialty is made of teaching the Script-ures in such a manner that a general under-standing of them may be acquired. There will be three departments in Bible study for advanced studentsŠthose desiring to fit themselves as teachers or for some other position of useful-ness,Šfirst Bible history, second theology, and third, the parables of our Saviour. Instruction will also be given in the best methods of mis-sionary labor, especially that phase of it which relates to correspondence and how to arrest the attention of the careless to those subjects which pertain to their eternal interests. This course of instruction will be adapted to older persons, and those who cannot follow set rules in text-books. There will be lectures from time to time on the subject of hygiene, illustrating before the class the adulteration in foods and giving in-struction upon proper ventilation and those subjects which can be made of practical use. This instruction will not take the place of studies commonly taught in such schools. Certain hours each day will be devoted to physical employment. The conductors of the school have already found by experience that while the student engages in some employment that calls into exercise the muscles of the body, as well as the judgment, he will accomplish more with fewer hours of study than he would without that physical training. We think any who have a spirit and burden of labor can be benefited by the Biblical course and by the lect-ures on these practical subjects. It is the design of those having charge of the school to make every arrangement in their power to carry out these principles which the most successful schools have found to be the true principles of education, and also to make the stay of those who come as pleasant as pos-sible. South Lancaster is one of the oldest towns in Massachusetts. Its broad streets, with stately elms on each side, its neat residences and verdant hills, make it as attractive a place as is often found in any rural district in New England. All connected with the school are expected to attend church on the Sabbath if able, and pay that outward respect to the worship of God which is thought to be consistent. Our only hope is in God. We acknowledge oar de-pendence upon him, and seek his guidance in the enterprise. We invite those who wish to learn more par-ticulars of the school to send for catalogue, and correspond with those connected with the school. All correspondence addressed to South Lancaster Academy, South Lancaster, Mass., will receive prompt attention. S. N. HASKELL. THE love of Christ is like the blue sky into which we see but dimly, and the real vastness of which we cannot measure. But in the near future all true servants will see " face to face."  IN IMID YE who sow with anxious yearning, And your tireless vigil keep, Waiting, watching, patience learning,.  "If ye faint not, ye shall reap." Though the harvest long delaying Cause you, sorrowing, to weep, Still believe this faithful sayingŠ"If ye faint not, ye shall reap." Ground now dead and barren seeming, Blooming shall awake from sleep; For the promise rises beamingŠ"If ye faint not, ye shall reap." Seeds of truth around you flinging, On fair mead and rugged steep, In your ears one truth be ringinŠ" If ye faint not, ye shall reap.' Fearless tread the path of duty, Joy shall cause your hearts to leap, When, from fields of golden beauty, " If ye faint not, ye shall reap." North Pacific T. and X. Society.

SECOND MEETING.ŠThe Committee 011 Resolu-tions being called on, submitted the following:Š WHEREAS, Portland is an important commercial center, from which steamer and railroad lines radiate to all parts of the great Northwest, and is also visited by ships from foreign lands, thus making it a point from which the present truth can be sent to all parts of the world; therefore, Resolved, That we proceed at once to establish in East Portland a ship and city mission, to be con-ducted on the plan which is adopted by our people in San Francisco, Boston, and other places. WHEREAS, The public reading-rooms, and the parlors and reading-rooms of our best hotels offer most favorable opportunities to place our papers be-fore the public, and WHEREAS, These papers if placed in a binder will be more readily accepted, and will also be preserved so as to be read by many persons, therefore, Resolved, That we recommend that our local so-cieties furnish these and similar places with the Good Health and the Siam OF THE TIMES, also that a binder be furnished for the SIGNS, and that wherever practicable the paper be placed in the binder by some member of the society. Resolved, That this society will accept the gen-eral agency of our subscription works, and that we will encourage workers to engage in the canvassing enterprise. Resolved, That for two weeks after,  this meeting we hold a class for the instruction of canvassers and colporters, and that we invite Eld. Wm. Ings to remain here and assist in conducting the same. WHEREAS, The necessary enlargement of our work calls for commodious rooms in which to keep our publications and do the work of the State So-ciety, therefore, Resolved, That we heartily approve of the action of our president in building the rooms now occupied as State depository and reading-room, that we now assume the expenses of the enterprise, and that we make it the headquarters of our ship and city mis-sion. The resolutions were taken up separately, and alter interesting and profitable remarks by Elders Waggoner, Loughborough, White, Ings, and others, they were unanimously adopted. THIRD M EETIN G.-- T he following additional res-olutions were presented by the ceminittee:Š WHEREAS, There are great responsibilities resting upon us in the opportunities we have to give the present truth to the people in this large Conference, and, WHEREAS, we have but few ministers and colpor-ters, therefore, Resolved, That it is our duty to engage more vig-orously in the work of mailing the SIGNS to per-sons who may become interested readers, and circu-lating our publications in our own neighborhood. WHEREAS, Experience has shown the good results of systematic and continued labor put forth in one lo-cality by the vigilant missionary workers, therefore, Resolved, That we recommend that each local society select so ne special territory to which to mail the SIGNS and to give it a thorough canvass be-fore leaving it for some other field. Resolved, That we put forth our earnest efforts to secure subscribers for the Sabbath Sentinel, and that we give it a wide circulation in all parts of our Con-ference. In response to questions raised, remarks were made by Elders Loughborough, Waggoner, and.  White concerning some of the leaders at Oak-land and Battle Creek, following which the res-olutions were adopted. The Auditing Committee presented the fol-lowing:Š "Your committee appointed to audit the accounts of the State Secretary has done so, and found them correct. IL D. BENHAM, Auditor."

REPORTS in Present Truth, indicate a pros-perous work in England. At Grimsby, whore the paper is published, several persons are de-voting their time to the missionary work, and the results are very satisfactory. Workers in other logalities aro also of good courage.
