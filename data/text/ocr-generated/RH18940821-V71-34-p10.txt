538 ADVENT .R_EYIENT AND SABBATH HERALD. "[VoL. 71, No. 34. every soul. No government can help, and none can hinder. Its pretended help is a damage, its opposition is useless. Government may make church-membership honorable, and thus induce hypocrisy, but no earthly power can make it easier for a man to confess and forsake his sins. The heart must be broken and humbled by the power of God's love before it can be cleansed and changed, and that power alone begins and ends the work. Christ both sends the convict-ing spirit and supplies the cleansing fountain. That fountain.is open and free to every one ; and if ministers of the gospel, instead of looking to the government as the source of help for the regen-eration of mankind, would stand by that fountain that was opened on Calvary, and would cry, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters," a work might be wrought that the world as yet has not seen. Blessed life-giving fountain I now open but soon to close, when the work of our great High Priest in the sanctuary in heaven shall be finished. " To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart." "Come to that fountain so pure and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet, Plunge in to-day and be made complete." M. E. K. SUNDAY OBSERVANCE. FROM copies of a local paper published at Sleepy Eye, Minn., kindly sent us by some friend, we learn that the Union Congregational church of that place has adopted and published a memorial which contains the following resolu tion among others relating to the better observ-ance of Sunday : Š "Resolved, That we, the undersigned Christian church of Sleepy Eye, Minn., do most emphatically declare, in the light of sacred scriptures and of the true Chris-tians in every age, that the playing of games, such as ball-playing, croquet-playing, billiard-playing, cards, chess, checkers, and all such games, for pleasure, diver-sion or otherwise, on the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, is unlawful, and degrading to good morals." The church calls on newspapers and other churches to co-operate in this reformation. A week or two later the Catholic priest of the town replied through the same paper. We give the second letter almost entire, because of its importance as a testimony upon the merits of the Sabbath question at this time. " REPLY TO SUNDAY OBSERVANCE. " It is stated that Sunday laws are civil laws, and have nothing to do with religion. They were born in a union of Church and State, and at a time when the rulers were Roman Catholics. The object of them was to en-force respect for a religious dogma, as their titles and wordings clearly show. When the separation of the Church and the State took place in the Constitution of the United States, there could, in fact, be made only a civil disguise of them, which, from time to time, had always been boldly thrown off; for all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty, and no person ought, by any law, to be molested in person or estate on account of his religious belief or his religious practice. "The imprisonment of the Seventh-day Adventists in several States and fines of about $55 in each of many individual cases for performing bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, prove that the government assumes the right to enforce a religious dogma of the Catholic Church. We have civil duties we owe to the State and to each other. The Bible numbers them all. But when the law of the State enforces on us a dogma, which we do not find in the Bible, and which is solely a Roman Catholic one, what will those Christians say to it who pronounce the Bible their sole teacher in doctrine and morals ? The Episco-pal Church, in her twentieth article of religion, admits that the church cannot ordain anything contrary to God's written word. The Augsburg confession in 1530 clearly admitted that the observance of the Lord's day had been appointed by the Catholic Church only. "The historian R. Baird writes : 'The rulers of Massa-chusetts put the Quakers to death and banished Anti-nomians and Anabaptists, not because of their religious tenets, but because of their violation of civil laws.  This is the justification they pleaded, and it was the best they could make of it. Wherever there is a union of Church and State, heresy and heretical practices are apt to become violations of the civil code, and are punished no longer as errors in religion, but as infrac-tions of the laws of the land. These defenders of the Inquisition have always spoken and written in justifi-cation of that awful tribunal; for who has not read of the Spanish Inquisition, of the Protestant Inquisition in England and Germany ? In fact, have we not here in this free country great and little inquisitors, who may denounce us to the government should we work on Sundays and thus incur the penalty of paying a fine of about $55 or ninety days' imprisonment? "The Catholic Church for over one thousand years before the existence of a Protestant, by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from Saturday to Sun-day because he who called himself the Lord of the Sab-bath, endowed her with his own power to teach. He that heareth you heareth me;' he commands all who believe in him to hear her, under penalty of beinfrb  placed with the 'heathen and publican;' and promised to be with her to the end of the world. She holds her charter as teacher from him,Š a charter as infallible as perpetual. The Protestant world at its birth found the Christian Sab-bath too strongly intrenched to run counter to its exist-ence. It had to acquiesce in the arrangement, thus implying the character and right to change the day, for over three hundred years. The Christian Sabbath is, therefore, to this day, the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church as spouse of the Holy Ghost, with-out a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world. " Those who admit the Bible alone as the teacher and guide in faith and morals, must know that it most emphatically forbids any change in the day, and calls for a perpetual covenant. It is an apostasy from an assumed fixed principle, as self-contradictory, self-stultifying, and consequently as suicidal as it is within the power of language to express.Š Geo. Par, Catholic Rector." BRETHREN. THE children of God are referred to by Paul as the adopted sons of God. " Having predes-tinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." Eph. 1 : 5, 6. It often happens in this world that when a child is adopted, the real children feel aggrieved, and though the parents who adopt the child are full of tenderness and love, the real heir or heirs do not take kindly to the one who was adopted. They want all the inheritance for themselves. This was not the course pursued toward us by the Lord Jesus Christ. He is not an adopted son. He is the " only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." He was the heir, the only heir of all things ; for by him the worlds were made. Glory unspeakable and enduring was his by inalienable right. But he did not think this the greatest thing to be desired. When he saw the human race whom the Father bad created through him gone astray and lost, he gave up all that glory, and to redeem the race, he took their nature and identi-fied himself with them. Not only did he become one like us, but he became one of us. Thus we read, "For both he that sanetifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one ; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren." Heb. 2: 11. Then, having redeemed us, he, as the generous Elder Brother, offers us a joint share with himself in his inheritance. " For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God ; and if children, then heirs ; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." Rom. 8 :15-17. Yes, those who are adopted into the family of heaven have a rich Father, and an Elder Brother,  who, having purchased them with his own blood, and bought back their heritage, calls them his brethren, and grants them a joint share with him-self, saying, " To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." E. K. ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. 403.Š RAISING AND PICKING HOPS. If it is considered Wrong to engage in raising hops for the market, would it also be wrong to engage in pick- ing them for those who do raise them? C. S. W. We prefer to let individuals answer such ques-tions with their own conscience. Those who think it wrong to pick hops should not do it. Their brother may be able conscientiously to do so. It is their privilege in a brotherly way to show him his wrong, but let them not condemn those who may not be able to see as they do. 404.-EATING THE SIN-OFFERING. In Lev. 6 : 25, 26 we read that the priest that offered the offering for sin should "eat it; in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation." What did the eating of it signify? and what does it mean to us? H. E. D. This question opens up a most vital and inter-esting subject, upon the merits of which we can here scarcely enter. The essential idea in the sin-offering was expiatory. There was a dif-ference in the disposition that was made of the blood and bodies of the offerings, according to the class of the offender. In the case of sin by the priest or congregation, the blood was taken into the sanctuary, and the body was burned without the camp. For the sin of an individual the blood was not carried into the sanctuary, but was used about the altar ; and the flesh was eaten by the priests in the sanctuary. A circumstance is recorded in Lev. 10 : 16-20 that throws some light upon the significance of this rule. After the death of his two sons, Aaron neglected on that day to eat the sin-offering. Moses ascertained that the goat had been burned, and asked of his brother the reason. Aaron's reply was dignified and satisfactory, to the effect that after the events of the day had wrung his heart, he could not consistently act before God as under ordinary circumstances. Moses in his inquiry says : " Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the in-iquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord ? Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ; ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place." Thus it would seem that while general or com-munity sins were transferred to the sanctuary, the frailties and sins of the individual were as-sumed by the priest himself. The priests were but a type of Christ. They " served unto the example and shadow of heav-enly things." Christ who knew no sin became sin for us. The Lord "laid on him the iniquity of us all." The sin was transferred to the vic-tim from the sinner. The priest ate the victim and thus became sin for the sinner. Does Christ, then, become a sinner ? ŠYes ; not by practice, but by imputation. The goat was the chosen of-fering for sin, though other less expensive ani-mals might be accepted. The flesh of the goat is not desirable food ; and from this fact we know that this provision was not simply to furnish food for the priests. The practice was signifi-cant of the deepest truths of divine revelationŠthe identification of Christ with humanity in its weakness and lost condition. G. C. T.
