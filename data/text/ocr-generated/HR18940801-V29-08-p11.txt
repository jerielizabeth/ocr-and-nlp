A MEDICAL OBJECTION TO DANCING. BY GEORGE L. BEARDSLEY, A. M., M. D., Birmington, Conn. 231 7 P. M., lunch ; 9 P. M., sponging or rrbbing of the spine and preparation for Ł the night. The treat-ment is varied from day to day by the physician according to each individual case 'or to suit chang-ing conditions. In carrying out such a program, the nurse will certainly find no time for idleness; and besides the treatment enumerated, there is a vast number of little things to be done for the patient, such as reading, writing letters, keeping visitors away, do-ing little errands, and above all else, " making sun-shine " for the patient. ge THESEUS, in " Midsummer Night's Dream," asks, " Is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour?" His idea of mirth is akin to that of many who prate about "innocent amusements" to kill time or put an end to the megrims, either caring not for, or thinking not of, the after-effects of a revel. There is often a greater good done to the tired brain by a game than by medicine, but it is of vital concern to the person to be entertained, that the sport has not too much rigor. Is dancing a jollity of this kind? This is the suggestion of the article now submitted. From a physical standpoint or on the issue of health, it is susceptible of proof that the muscular fatigue and strain incident to this sort of fun is detrimental to the bodily vigor and endurance of woman. Medical men, particularly specialists, often meet with patients who are nothing short of invalidism. They are walking valetudinarians who ought to be in a sanitarium, and would be, if they had money. A large percentage of the feeble, nervous, chlorotic girls and women who frequent a doctor's office are those who are obliged to eke out an existence with a body not put together to bear much of any burden, but who, because of a contracted purse, must all day operate a treadle or measure calico or tend a card-ing machine or teach school. The public knows almost nothing about the feeble energy of the major-ity of girls who work in our stores and factories for their bread and clothes, how small is their surplus of strength beyond what is necessary to a day's call on their nerves and muscles. The testimony of those who have particularly looked into the causes of woman's aches and invalidism agrees with the saving  of Pope that she is "fair by defect and delicately weak." Is it a marvel, then, that when such struct-ures are taxed by the wearying gymnastics of a ball-room, their savings-bank of health early becomes insolvent? Graceful dancing is no ordinary nor easy achievement ; it requires more than a relish for light music or a lively company. There are few who are really artists in waltzing ; and as in athletics, mus-cle and agility are sine qua non, so to lead a cotillon or to step a schottische time involves a quick adaptation of muscles that if weary or dull answer the motions of a light-tripping partner too slowly for grace. To dance becomingly and with ease, every joint ought to be supple, every nerve fresh, every muscle limber, the entire body in a state of exaltation, not from ex-citement, but physical bouyancy. And yet a great percentage of those who waltz or promenade at our public dances engage in the pastime at the conclusion of a day's toil without a moment for recuperation, and are not physically able to go through the steps. A highly intelligent lady who is of delicate health and a close student remarked to me recently that she danced because she needed the exercise. There was no gainsaying her need of recreation; but just how three hours' waltzing, Š and that is work emphat-icallyŠ in a poorly ventilated, crowded parlor, could be a refreshing "exercise" to one who must ply her calling the next day is hard to understand. It would seem like giving one who had lost her sleep for a week a night's round as watcher in a sick room. The girl who is compelled to labor all and every day for her board-money has gone through all the strain her machinery can stand, and generally
