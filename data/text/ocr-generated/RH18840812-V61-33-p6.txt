ALICE H. BEAUMONT, Sec. IT will doubtless be of interest to our people to learn that a mission has been opened in 'the great city of Philadelphia. This has been in prospect by the brethren of the Pennsylvania Conference for some time, but for certain reasons the work has been delayed. No definite plans had been made as to just how much means should be expended in the enterprise ; but it was thought best to begin  small at first, and let the work increase as the way should open in the providence of God. We have spent two weeks in the city, locating and planning m ore definitely. A large house for the mission, located on North 8th St., three squares from the principal central street of the city, has been rented at $500 per year. The building is well adapted for the purpose for which it is to be used. A merchant occupies the ground floor, the mission-house proper including the second and third floors. A large front room on the second floor is to be used fora lecture-hall, and a room on the same floor will be used for a reading room. These rooms e we have furnished with carpets, chairs, tables, etc., at a cost of a little more than $100. They look remarkably neat and inviting, and are well adapted for the work. The location is all that could rea- sonably be desired. Eighth street is one of the principal streets in the city. The Union lines of street cars center near the mission-house, making it convenient for people in any part of the city to reach it at one fare. On the whole, we have in this building and lo-cation more than we had expected could be obtained at the rate of rent we pay. What is needed immediately is more efficient help, Bro. J. M. Kutz and wife being the only ones here at present. It will not increase the rent to locate three or four workers here, as the build-ing is of sufficient size to accommodate this number, and more if necessary. 'We found on careful in- vestigation that to start the mission in any smaller way would be only a waste of money, inasmuch as the size of the city and its importance demands that a good mission should be started at the ear- liest possible moment. We trust God has directed in this matter, and that -very soon efficient help can be furnished. We hope that God's people throughout the coun-try will be faithful in remembering at the throne of grace the mission in this great city of nearly a million souls. D. B. OvIATT.
