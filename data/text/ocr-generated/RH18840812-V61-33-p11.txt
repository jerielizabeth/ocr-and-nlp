THE time of our annual camp-meeting, August 28 to Sept. 9, is near at hand. The place selected is on the beautiful grounds owned by the V. C. R. R. between North Avenue and Lake Champlain, within the limits of Burlington, the largest city in the State. The city and surrounding country will be thoroughly canvassed, and the meeting adver-tised to a larger extent than heretofore. Those who have charge of the work will labor to secure and provide accommodations for all who may attend ; and while we feel grateful for the blessing of God and the measure of success that has attended our annual meetings in the past, we hope and con-fidently expect, that our coming camp-meeting will be the largest and most important one ever held in Vermont ; and to this end we invite the co-opera-tion of all our brethren and sisters in the State. Besides the ministering brethren in our own Con-ference, it is expected that Elds. S.' N. Haskell, Uriah Smith, and E. W. Whitney, will be with us. Also Sr. White, as already noticed in the RE- VIEW, is coming from California to help us. While these servants of God, some of whom are nearly worn out laboring for the advancement of the cause we love, are coming so far and at great expense to meet with us, let us all show our appreciation of their efforts in our behalf by our presence at the meeting. Let us one and all seek the Lord with all our hearts, that his blessing may be with us in our preparation for the meeting, and that while we are gathered there we may be enabled to labor success-fully for the salvation of those who know not the truth. The meeting will continue ten days, and we hope all who possibly can will come at the com-mencement and remain till the close. Let us think of the toil and labor the servants of God are tak-ing upon themselves to give instruction and warn us of the near approach of the great day of God. And shall we not leave our homes and our worldly cares for a few days to listen to their words of love and encouragement ? We can not afford to lose these precious opportunities. We would extend to our brethren and sisters of the Canada Conference a cordial invitation to at-tend the meeting, also to those in New York who live on the borders of the lake. A large tent will be on the ground for those who are not otherwise provided for. Let none stay away who can possibly come. Bring your children, and invite your friends and neighbors to come with you. Free return checks are secured on all the rail-roads for those who attend the meeting, and arrange-ments will be made to carry passengers and bag-gage to and from the grounds. We also expect to secure a reduction of fare on the boats plying be-tween Burlington and the ports in New York, for the brethren who may attend from that State. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. DAY OF FASTING AND PRAYER FOR OHIO. ACCORDING to the suggestion of the President of the General Conference, we would recommend that all in Ohio whose hearts beat in union with the third angel's message, spend Sabbath, August 30, 1884, as a day of prayer and fasting. With humiliation of soul let us seek God together, ex-amine ourselves, confess our sins, and turn from every evil way, that the light of God's glory may rest upon his people and cause in Ohio. We have not seen the moviugs of his Spirit to that ex-tent which we have desired. Heaven is full of light ; God is waiting to clothe his people with power, and will do, it when we place ourselves where he can trust us with more of his Spirit. Shall not our camp-meeting be a "Jerusalem," a "Pentecost " 7 With " one accord " let us seek God to this end, and come up to this feast to work in faith as never before. CONF.

Tue Master has gone away From the earth where a while he wrought, And the shadows about him lay, To the glorious land of day, And we follow him in our thought. He has left, that there be no loss, In the land of his love below, Where the gold is mixed with dross, His servants to bear his cross And to teach till all peoples know. Each day when the morning breaks, Each worker, happy and strong, To the voice of his Lord awakes, And gladly his task he takes, And begins his work with a song. Each goes not whither he will, But whither the Master sends ; By the side of the flower-kissed rill, Or to climb the difficult hill Alone, or with troops of friends. And each in the setting sun Turns gladly his grateful thought To the day's work faithfully done, The triumph his heart has won, The deeds that his hands have wrought. And the Master pays each night The wages the man loves best, The comfort and deep delight That are his who does the right, The blessedness and the rest. But he keeps for the greater day His final award to men. Oh, happy indeed are they Who labor and do not stay, And alas for the idlers then I ŠMarianne Faritingham, ira Christian World. ILLINOIS. OBLONG, Ana. 4.ŠOur meetings are still pro-gressing, and the interest with some is increasing. Some have taken their stand on the Sabbath, and we hope for more. We expect to remain here another week, hoping the Lord will bless our ef-forts. Some opposition is rising. May the Lord help us. Pray for us. T. M. STEWARD. R. H. BROOK. VIRGINIA. LINVILLE, JULY 24.---We closed our tent meetings here July 20. Three have embraced the truth, and were baptized at the close of the meetings. Oth ers are almost persuaded, and we believe they will yet obey. We received S7.16 in donations. We will. next prepare for holding our camp-meeting, which commences Aug. 5. Pray for us that we may be humble in the presentation of the truth. . IL A. RIFE. B. F. PURDHAM. R. D. HOTTLE. KENTUCKY. BOSTON, NELSON Co.ŠBegan meetings the even-ing of July 17, with a congregation of fifty ; but several times since the number present has reached 250. The Sabbath question has been only par-tially canvassed. We cannot tell as yet what the result will be. We are in the midst of a wealthy farming community. They seem very kind in pro-viding for our wants. Received as donations $5.50. Have sold $15.50 worth of reading mat-ter. One excellent family, that of the miller of this place, have fully taken their stand on the truth. Our courage is good. S. OBSORN. W. H. SAXBY. VERMONT. EAST ROXBURY. ŠOur meetings still continue, but with somewhat abated interest. We note en-couraging tokens that the truth is affecting deeply the hearts of some, and a few are commencing to obey. We have had to encounter the most malignant spite lately, insomuch that we are obliged to take down our tent, which we are doing to-day. The school-house, where all meetings in the place are held, is open to us when not occupied. We shall therefore continue our meetings on the Sab-bath and three evenings in the week, until a thor-ough work for those accepting the truth has been accomplished. I. E. KIMBALL. July 80. G. W. PAGE. TEXAS. ARKADA, JULY 29.ŠLeaving Ladonia, and not having time to hold a meeting in a new field, we pitched the tent again at this place, and by visit-ing and other labor have endeavored to water the seedŁ sown and strengthen the things that remain. Have organized a Sabbath-school, and a leader is selected to take charge of the meetings for the future. Have sold during this visit about $45 worth of books and Bibles, and have obtained three subscriptions for the REVIEW, and two for Good Health. We leave about twenty-five adults keeping the Sabbath as the result of the divine favor and our very imperfect efforts. We feel thankful to God for his blessing we have enjoyed, and that sinners have been saved from their sins. Four were baptized. Closed meetings, Sunday night, and will go to Dallas till after camp meet- ing. R. M. Kt:worm. OHIO. GREENSELIRGH, TRUMBULL CO.ŠWe pitched our tent at this place July 23d, and commenced meet-ings the 24th. Have given fifteen discourses and held three Bible-readings. The people here are very friendly, and they, with the brethren and sisters of the North Bloomfield church, have sup-plied all our wants in the way of eatables abun-dantly. We expect, by the help of the Lord, a good work to be accomplished there. We have appointed a three days' meeting at the tent, commencing Aug. 15, and continuing ova Sabbath and SI:111-day. The President of our Conference will be present, and we 'hope all our brethren and sisters living near will attend this meeting. Bring bedding with you. We have two family tents pitched and two others that can be pitched. Come, brethren, and let us seek God's blessing. Your influence at this point in our meetings may tell much for the truth. W. J. STONE. 0. J. MASON. WEST VIRGINIA. (ix Bow, Pacurz Co.ŠWe commenced meetings at this place last Monday evening in a school-house. The town is thinly settled, and our congregations are small, but the interest and attendance are grad-ually increasing. At first we had some trouble in finding a home among the people, as it was believed that we were Mormons. Last evening we were invited to four places to stay all night. We are visiting from house to house, distributing reading matter, talking and praying with the people. We have had invitations to preach at other places near here ; and we trust that, by God's help, we may be able to present his truth in such a way as to lead precious souls to a knowledge of' it. Scattered over the hills and vales of West Virginia are many per-sons who have no knowledge of the third angel's message. Brethren, pray for us that we may be faithful, and that God may bless our efforts. W. R. FOB GIN. Aug. 1, A. A. MEREDITH. ARKANSAS. SPRINGBALE.ŠSinee our last report Eld. Bab-cock, presiding elder of the M. E. church, and Eld. Tupper, of the Missionary Baptists, have preached against us on the Sabbath question. The people were disappointed when they saw the weak-ness of their arguments and the contradictory nature of their positions. Both discourses were reviewed at the tent, and the result has again proved that men can do nothing against the truth but for the truth. Our friends are very much en-couraged. Fourteen new names have been attached to the covenant, making forty-five in all. Last Sabbath thirteen were buried with their, Lord in baptism. It was a good day for the cause here. The Lord is coming very near his people. Others await baptism next Sabbath. July 28. D. A. WELLMAN. J. W. SCOLES. axe.
