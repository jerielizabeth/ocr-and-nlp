trees and the seeds of the 
plants as his proper and only food. It 
was no 
part of hiA sustenance or 
pleasure that he i,hould 
eat the flesh of those 
tures that Go<l had subjected to his 
thority. Yet this was the only period in 
the historv of our race 
when man could use such 
food an,l have it absolutely free 
from disease. But God made man to eat 
fruits and not 
flesh; and to supply his 
wants caused that out of the ground 
should grow 
e~·ery tree that was 
pleasll.nt to the sight and good for food. Would 

that man had never lost 
Para.disc. Afte1· man's expulsion from the garden 
of Eden, the 
origin:tl law rela.tive to what 
he should 
cat remained in force until the 
close of the flood, 
a period of nearly 
1700 years. What 
was the condition of 
man during this 
1011g period of nearly one-third 
of our world's entire 
historv? Were not 
mankind a feeble race, 
di1ninutive in 
ure, sickly and 
i;hort-lived? And when 
God for wise reasons, after the flood, 
fered man to 
eat the flesh of animals as 
his food, did 
not:~ great improvement in 
the physical 
character, and in the 
ity of 
th~ race occur? ~:very attentive reader of the book of Genesis can answer 

these questions without difficulty. 
ing-the entire period before the flood, 
when ma11 was by law restricted to the 
use of vegetable food, the life of each 
dividual reached almost 
to a thousand years ! And to use the expressive 
guage of Moses, 
" There were giants in 
the earth in those 
days." And as the record shows UR, immediately after the 
use of 
animal food was permitted, the 
lives of men 
bPgan to be abridged with 
fearful rapidity. 
Men had abused their 
longevity, and hardened themselves in 

sin ; and for 
thi!1 very reason 
it may be, 
that God 
saw it best th at man's life should 
be shortened to a 
hand breadth. When God took the Israelites in hand 
to lead them to the land of promise, he 
designed to fee<l them himself, while in 
the wildemesi;, and to do it 
with such food as 
should best meet 
all their wants. 
This was the 
manna, food prepared for 
them by the 
angcl8 of God. But this did 
not satisfy their 
depraved appetites. They 
murmured for 
animal food, and God in 
his displeas,tre sent it. Had they 
ened to him he would have subdued their 
enemies under them and fed them with 
the finest of the 
wheat, that is, wheat of 
the be8t q ualitv, and Ł honey out of the 
flinty rock. The Hebrews would 
have Ł animal food, and 
as the next best thing 
that could be 
<lone, God gave them rules to distinguish between clean and uncle:m 
anim:ils, marking such distinctions as 
l1a\'e ever existed among the brute creation. 
God would have 
had Israel act in a 
very different manner, but he allowed 
them their choice. And when we come 
to the New Testament we do not 
find that the permission to eat 
animal food is 
withrawn, or that its 
use should be 
bidden. Yet there are many general 
rections and exhortations that have 
an important bearing upon 
this matter. 'When P:ml says (I Cor. x, 
31 ), 
er therefore 
ye eat, or 
drink, or 
ever ye do, do all to the glory of God," 
he certainly imposes on us a strong gation to use such food as shall be~t proŁ mote health, cleamess of mind and 
dom from 
disease. When he 
says, (I Cor. vi, 
12, 13,} 
ing of food, "All things are lawful unto 
me, but 
all things are not expedient," etc., 
he certainly means to teach that there 
are kinds of food not unlawful, that is, not 
forbidden, which it is for our best good 
to let alone. 
Nay, the apostle citing the very acts of 
Israel in lusting after animal food m the 
wilderness, and bringing upon 
thcm~elves the displeasure of God by 
so doing, says, "Now these things were our 
example~, to the intent we should 
not lust after evil 
things as they also lusted." 1 Cor. x, 5, 6. A few thoughts relative to the 
diency and wisdom of abstaining from 
flesh as food: I. God made man to eat grains and 
fruits. Such 
was the original design, and 
auch will be the 
final lot of the redeemed. 
2. The antediluvian period in which 
mankind were 
regtricted to veg-etable food was marked by the most wonderful 

gevity, and the most extraordinary 
opment of his 
phy~ical being. 3. Human life was shortened ately, and with fearful rapidity upon the 
introduction of animal food. 
4. God did not design this for Israel, 
and was grieved that they would have it. 
5. Animals are subject to 
disease as well as men, and it 
is not easy to detect 
this in the 
flesh when it is prepared for 
the market. It 
is not unfrequent, 
as we have good reason to believe, 
that fatal disease is originated by taking the 
flesh of diseased animals. 6. It is well known that no sooner do 
animals exhibit distinct 
marks of dieease,
