AUGUST 7, 1884. THE 'SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 473 The law is in the interest of good morals; of public peace; it will lessen the amount of crime, and of taxes; it will protect the young from the snare of the gilded saloon; it will secure food and clothes to the wives and children of those who have squandered their wages for the means of their own degradation. Can they complain of this ? No; this is all desirable. But above all this there is one harrowing thought which troubles them more than the approach of the cholera. What if, after all they have said, it should prove that prohibition does prohibit? The loss of such a precious theory is more than they can bear. Prohibition is fast coming into favor, and is mak-ing rapid strides toward success in almost every direction. Whether it will be materially benefited by separate party action remains to be seen. We do not say it will not; we have as yet no evidence that it will, That the nominee of the Prohibition party will receive a large vote seems improbable. That, however, is no real argument against the step they have taken. If it shall be the means of arousing the public to the importance of the subject, then good will be accomplished. There are difficulties in the way of uniting all the true friends of tem- perance in a separate party movement. The party, when fully formed, must avow some policy of Govern-ment beyond the sole question of temperance. We have seen how difficult it was for the two recent conventions in Chicago to adopt "platforms " suited to the demands of the interests of the whole country. A third party would have to meet this question very soon, and it is no relief to promise " reform " without a distinct policy, as the veriest demagogue in the land can take up this cry as well as the best re-former. In two States prohibition has been carried to suc-cess by the Republican party. In others it has re-ceived the strong support of the Democratic party. Whether the Prohibition party can secure these votes is a question. In Maine there is a probability of nearly all the votes going to the old parties, be-cause both parties are fully committed to prohibition. Success thus far has been achieved by submitting the question in the form of an amendment to be voted upon by all parties. Then every tt:uperance man could vote without sacrificing his political pref-erences. There is no doubt that prohibition can command a larger vote in that manner than in any other. A third party is pretty sure to put some " plank " in its platform which must alienate some friends of the cause, as was the case in California in 1882. In that case the prohibition vote was scarcely large enough to be noticed. Had the question been submitted as a separate one, to be voted upon by all parties without regard to political questions, the vote would have been very much larger. It will not do to say that this course has proved a failure in several States. It has proved successful in several States, and where it failed it was not so great a failure as a third-party vote would have been in the same States. To-day a third party cannot command so large a vote in those States as was given in favor of a Constitutional amendment when the vote was taken. It is for this reason we say we have no assurance that the present movement, or the third party, will greatly aid the cause of prohibition. Intemperance is a monster curse in our land. But it must yet be borne in mind that it is but one of many evils, and the reform sought for, especially by political organization, is partial in its nature. True temperance is a Christian grace, provided it be coupled with the other graces. Separated from them, it is no part of Christianity. We joyfully unite with all workers in the cause of reform, but we can never lose sight of the truth that a thorough reform outside of Christianity is impossible. This is our "platform;" for this we labor; in this we trust. And this we recommend. to all as the only source of per-fect peace and happiness, for "the life that now is, and that which is to come." Christ the End of the Law. (Continued.) IN our last article, two weeks ago, we showed how it is that "Christ is the end of the law for righteous-ness to every one that believeth." We wish to con-sider this matter a little further, for, as we then said, there is very much that might be said upon it. In-deed, the whole gospel is comprised in that one sen-tence; for the gospel is simply the good news of how men who have broken the law may be saved, through Christ, and enabled to keep it. In all our investi-gations let it be borne in mind that the righteousness of God is contained in his law (Isa. 51 :4-7), and that Christ is the end of the law only for righteous-ness, which is equivalent to saying that he is the ob_ ject of the law for obedience. We now call the attention of the reader very briefly to the seventh chapter of Romans. We have space to notice only a portion of the chapter. In that the apostle brings to view, wing himself as an illustration, the progress of a man from a state of worldly, carnal security, to that of acceptance with God. Let us follow him in his narrative. First we notice his statement in verse 7 that the law is not sin. This he proves by showing that it is the law which points out and forbids sin. Then, of course, it must be perfect. We can detect base coin only by using genuine coin as a standard. The parallel to this verse is found in chap. 3 :20, where he says:" By the law is the knowledge of sin." He continues, "For without the law sin was dead." Verse 8. This is the statement of verse 7 in another form. Before the law was brought to his knowledge, he did not know sin; it did not trouble him any. Although he did not know the law, he was a sinner, yet his sin, so far as his knowledge was concerned, was dead. "For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." Verse 9. Without the law (" the commandment") he was in a state of ease and carnal security, perfectly satisfied with himself. But when the law was ap-plied, it made his sin assume hideous proportions. He saw himself just as he was. "And the command-ment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." Verse 10. How is this ? The command-ment (law) was ordained to life; that is, its object was to give life, which it will always do to those who obey it. "The man which doeth these things shall live by them." Rom. 10:5. This was the ob-ject of the law, but now that the law has been vio-lated, it cannot fulfill the end for which it was de-signed; it can only condemn to death. Mark this well; around this fact the whole argument centers. And how did the apostle regard that law which, by showing him to be such a sinner, had condemned him to death ? Said he: " Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Veme 12. He acknowledged the perfectness of the law. And herein he showed his honesty of heart. He did not rail at the law, applying to it all manner of opprobrious epithets, and try to evade it or convince himself that it was abolished. No; he confessed himself a sinner, justly condemned by a perfect law. He recognized the fact that the law had done nothing to him; it had not created sin in him, but had simply brought to light that which previously existed. The effect of introducing the law is to make sin appear exceeding sinful. It is as a rod thrust to the bottom of a vessel of water, which roils the water by stirring up the sediment that lay in the bottom, yet it creates no impurity whatever. The dirt would be there if the rod were not introduced; therefore Paul did not complain, for he knew that the fault was in himself, and not in the law. So he exclaims: "For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin." In verse 9 Paul anticipates his argument, when he says, " And I died." This was the final result in  his case. What does he mean by this ? In the light of the preceding verse the answer is clear. When he was alive, it was when he was without the lawŠlawless; a servant of sin. Death is the direct opposite of life; therefore when the command-ment came, and he died, it must mean that he yielded to the claims of the law, and ceased sinning. And this will be the result with every one who is as honest with himself as Paul was. This is conver-sion. But as before said, the apostle anticipates in Ł order to place the effect side by side with the cause; he did not die without a struggle. We have now the man before us as a convicted sinner, and here is his description: "For that which I do I allow not; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I." Verse 15. This verse is introduced by "for," showing that it is a consequence of something that goes before. The preceding clause is, "But I am carnal, sold under sin." Now what is the condition of a man who is sold into slavery? He is unable to do anything for himself. He may be conscious of the degradation of his posi-tion, and longjo be free; but he is placed where he cannot help himself; his hands or feet are bound with a chain. Every sinner is in bondage. (See 2 Pet. 2 :19.) Before the law of God is held up be-fore him, he is unconscious of his slavery; when he sees its claims, he arouses to a sense of his condition. But his struggle to break the galling chain is fruit-less, because his long-continued bondage has weak-ened him. This struggle of the convicted sinner against sin is mentioned in several verses of this chapter. "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." Verses 16, 17. Here we have the case of a man con-victed of sin by the law, conscientiously trying to keep it, and yet continually violating it, even against his will. "It is not I that do it," he says; "I do not design to violate the law; but sin has bound me so long, and has such power over me, that I cannot get free." It is no longer from desire that he sins, but from the force of habit which he can-not break. And so the fruitless struggle goes on, until the man in an agony of despair, exclaims: "0 wretched man that I aml who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Verse 24. We cannot imagine a more horrible condition than the one here brought to view. In ancient times a criminal was sometimes chained to the dead body of a man, and forced to drag the putrefying carcass wherever he went, until the effluvium caused him to die a miserable death. Think of the desperate attempts such a man would make to get free, and how frantic he would become as he realized the impotence of his arm as com-pared with the chain that bound him. How his whole soul would go out in that piteous cry, "Who shall deliver me from this body of death ?" How many are there who have felt themselves in such a condition under the load of sin? It is in this condition the apostle (the repre-sentative of a class) finds himself. He feels that sin is about to sink him into perdition, and, con-vinced of the hopelessness of his struggle, he cries out for deliverance. " Who shall deliver me from this body of death?" Immediately the question is answered, and he again exclaims, this time with transports of joy, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." As soon as he realizes his own inability to meet the demands of the law, Christ is presented to his view, and he at once accepts deliverance from the only one who can give it. Christ strikes off the chain, and sets the prisoner free. Not only does he forgive past transgressions, but he helps us to break the chains of habit, and overcome the love of sin. And then the apostle continues: " There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." The reason why there is not, is told in the
