F III, I .1 In J! 232 THE HEALTH REFORMER. tiousness. Hysteria may have been the ulti-mate cause, which physicians assure us often leads its victim to refuse proper kinds or a proper amount of food, as in the case before us. But that a case like this in which the individ-ual refused certain kinds of food which the hy-gienic system enjoins, and refused a sufficient amount to nourish the system, contrary to its teaching, should be held up as one who has been sacrificed by the system, and as a warn-ing to prevent " others from becoming the vic-tims to the infatuation of the system of diet advocated and enforced in some of our religious papers," is passing strange. Either Mr. Pas-sett knows nothing about the system, or he is not to be envied as a reasoner. Our minds are not yet made so " weak " and " fanatical " by our system of living, as to accept such a mis-application for good common sense. This case should be a warning to any who may be in-clined to restrict themselves too far in the amount of food they take ; but it is not a warn-ing against the hygienic system, for it is con-trary to that system. It is further urged against the " system of diet advocated," &c., that God has made chil-dren and youth "omnivorous "  while growing and developing physically and mentally. What fearful characteristic this may be intended to describe, unless it is that during this time they would eat up Jupiter Ammon if they could get at him, we are unable to decide. That the health institutes of our land will close up, or the health journals suspend, or this grand reform collapse to any perceptible degree, as the result of this false note of alarm, we do not by any means imagine. U. S. Nature's Wants and Fashion's Requirements. " MAN wants but little here below." Strange to say, this seemingly erratic fancy of an En-glish poet has been concurred in and advocated by philosophers, physiologists, and physicians in every age. Moses, the mighty Jewish law-giver, deemed it not derogatory to his high mission when he essayed, besides governing, to regulate the diet of the Israelitish people. Formerly, entire nations have been content with one meal a day ; the demands of modern society render four or five necessary. No doubt the practice of taking but a solitary repast during the four-and-twenty hours was physically injurious, because of the quantity of food then consumed. Hence Celsus recommends those in good health to eat twice a day instead of once ; while, according to Sanctorius, who condemns the like practice, " the body grows more heavy and uneasy after six pounds of food taken at one meal than after eight pounds consumed at three ; and he who makes but one  meal in the day, let him eat much or little, is pursuing a system ultimately productive of mischief." Privation, moderation, and excess ! Each of these has its advocates and disciples. The peasantry of most European countries endure perpetual privation of necessity, not from choice. Mr. Thomas Carlyle conceives that a man may subsist upon fourpence a day. A physician residing at Malvern lately wrote a brochure in which he maintains that health and strength may readily be sustained by the mere outlay of sixpence per diem. History records that Alexander the Great, on setting out on a march, dismissed his cooks, observing that he carried with him superior assistants, viz., a long morning's journey to serve as an appetizer to his dinner, and a frugal dinner to give a rel-ish to his supper. In sooth, dietetics have long become a philosophy, of which school there are several sects, each of which battles stoutly for its opinions. Š Ordinarily, the inhabitants of this country partake of three meals a day, namely, break-fast, dinner, and supper. With many, what is called " tea " forms an additional repast. With regard to the morning meal, how greatly have we changed even since Queen Elizabeth's time ! Then a maid of honor, although highly bred, was not over-daintily nourished. Even the queen herself did not at all disdain a coarse repast. But then it must be borne in mind that our ancestors were hardier, possibly healthier, than their degenerate successors. Now, not alone the gentleman, but the artisan, breakfasts upon tea or coffeeŠluxuries which a century ago were procurable scarcely by the rich. What sort of a morning meal should be taken I This is a question which has caused some contention among those erudite folk to whom we are prone confidently to look up for guidance. Learned authorities are divided as regards the utility of a dry or a  liquid break-fast. Because, forsooth, Marcus Antoninus made it a rule to eat a hard biscuit when he got up, this practice has been advocated. But most respectable medical authorities concur that as the insensible perspiration is so greatly promoted by sleep, a liquid meal becomes ab-solutely necessary. But such may not suit every stomach ; for the stomach is occasionally a stubborn jade, that will persevere in its obstinacy, succumbing to no treatment, gentle or severe. It becomes as sensitive to the presence of certain kinds of food as do the olfactory nerves of a Roman lady to perfumes, creating sickness, and even syncope. Tea, accompanied with bread and butter or hot toast, for example, speedily creates heartburn in some people, owing to the oily part of the food becoming separated by the heat of the liquid. New bread is usually deleteri-
