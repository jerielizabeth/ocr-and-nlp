-r. PS;  J. VMŁ D Ł R: EMU' Mk CHEESE. ..4 NEXT to bread and meat, there is probably no single article of food which is more universally used among civilized people than cheese. This fact, however, cannot be regarded as a genuine passport to dietetic honors. That cheese has, from ancient times, been suspected of being more or less unwhole-some, is, however, evident from many well-known facts. Job, in his sufferings, mournfully compares himself to cheese. Shakespeare makes Falstaff, when convinced by the merry wives of Windsor, of his asininity, admit that he would be but justly punished if choked to death with a piece of toasted cheese. An old distich runs, Š " Cheese is a mighty elf, Digesting all things but itself." Well knowing that cheese is, in itself, difficult of digestion, the poet hoped to find some excuse for its use in the idea that it might, somehow, aid in the digestion of other substances. But our poet was not a physiologist, and hence may perhaps be excused for falling into so egregious an error. Cheese is not only not easily digestible, but swarms with microbes of various sorts which easily set up various fermenta-tive and decomposing processes in the contents of the stomach by which indigestion is induced, and various poisonous substances are developed, which, through absorption, become a source of contamina-tion to both blood and tissues. The following de-scription of making French Roquefort, which we quote from Harper's Weekly, makes it very clear why germs are present in cheese in such great num-bers, and why this substance so easily gives rise to digestive disorders :Š "The making of French Roquefort cheese is quite interesting. It is made of sheep's or goat's milk, and after coagulation, by the use of rennet, the curd is carefully pressed into shape, bandaged with coarse cloth, and dried on shelves. When well dried the  cheeses are carried to caves, where the bandages are removed, and they are carefully salted and left to ripen. In about twenty days they become covered with a white mold, which is scraped off with a knife. This process is repeated every fortnight for two months, the color of the mold changing from white to green and then to red, which ends the process." " Ugh ! " we imagine some of our readers to ex-claim, after reading the above description, in re-membrance of the delicate bits of Roquefort with which they have, at various times, regaled their depraved palates. We say depraved, for certainly no palate not depraved could possibly relish such a horrid mess. Limberger, another variety of cheese which is famous, or rather infamous, for its malodorous prop-erties, is not considered quite ripe until it is in the last state of putrefaction. Its manufacture was for-merly confined to Belgium, but cheese-makers in New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Illinois are said to have discovered, within the last few years, the means for pronioting decomposition to such a degree as to be able to produce a variety of Limberger which is considered by connoisseurs of things rank and rotten, as quite equal to the original article of Belgian manufacture. Moreover, cheese contains other things besides germs and the poisonous products of these mis-chievous microbes. Decaying animal matter of all sorts is an especial attraction to flies of various species which deposit their eggs on the mass of decomposing matter so that the young flies or larva' may find right at hand suitable food for their sustenance. This is nature's admirable arrangement by which decom-posing matters may be quickly disposed of. Cheese, like other rotting substances, thus attracts a certain species of fly, which in the larvx state, are known as skippers. Some of our readers, perhaps, are Ł ak, ( 248 )
