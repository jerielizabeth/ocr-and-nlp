474 THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. VoL. 10, No. 30. the resurrection of the just." The words of Christ, "Behold. I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be" (Rev. 22: 12), show that the resurrection, when the.  reward is given, is at the coming of Christ. And so again we have found that the righteous receive no reward till Jesus comes. This proposition, already proved, is sustained by many other plain declarations of Scripture. Let us once more refer to Paul's words to the Thessalonians: "For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of tie archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord." 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. Nothing can be plainer than this; the apostle has carefully guarded against any possibility of mistake. It is " the Lord himself" who comes. He conies, not secretly. but wish "a shout," and "with the trump of God," whose reverberations shake the earth. That mighty blast awakes the millions of sleeping saints,Šthose who have died in faith, not having received the promise.Šand they rise. This is the first thing accomplished. Then the living ones,Šthose who " remain until the coming of the Lord,"Šare caught up" together with them" (those who have just been raised from the dead) in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. This work of gathering the saints together is performed by the angels at the bidding of Christ. See Matt. 24: 30, 31. "And so," the apostle says, " shall we ever be with the Lord." The word " so " means " in this man-ner," "by this means." How is it, then, that we go to be with the Lord? By the resurrection of the dead, and the translation of the living. There is no other way brought to view in the Bible, by which we can be with the Lord. The doctrihe of the resurrection of the dead is not a product of the New Testament alone. When Abraham was called upon to offer up Isaac, he obeyed, "accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead." Heb. 11 :19. When Job was suffering not only physical torture, but the an-guish of being deserted and despised by all his friends and acquaintances, his faith in the coming of the Lord and the resurrection of the dead still sustained him. From his lips came this sublime ut-terance: "For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter (lay upon the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body [margin, though this body be destroyed], yet in my flesh shall I see God." Job 19 : '25, 26. Isaiah, in prophetic vision looking down the ages and beholding the troubles of the church, utters these consoling words: "Thy dead men shall live, to-gether with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead." Isa. 26 :19. Hosea, favored with a similar view, speaks as in Christ's stead, and says of the peo-ple of God: "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruc-tion." Hos. 13 :14. We have space in this article for only one more quotation. The prophet David, putting himself in the place of the church, and considering the perse-cution which it must endure "from men of the world, which have their portion in this life," anticipates the words of Paul in the eleventh of Hebrews, and says: "As for me, I will behold thy face in righteous-ness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness." Ps. 17 : 15. When will the saints be in the likeness of Christ? The beloved disciple says: " We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." John 3 :2. David, therefore, did not look for satisfaction until  the Lord's coming; but if he could have gone to Heaven at death, that certainly would have satisfied him. The following comments on Ps. 17:15, by Dr. Barnes. will be read with interest:Š " I shall be satisfied.' While they are satisfied with this world, I shall be satisfied only when I awake in the likeness of my God. Nothing can meet the wants of my nature; nothing can satisfy the aspi-rations of my soul, until that occurs. ' When I awake.' This is language which would be employed only by one who believed in the resurrection of the dead, and who was accustomed to speak of death as a sleepŠa calm repose in the hope of awaking to a new life. . . . The obvious interpretation of the passage, therefore, so far as its sense can be de-termined from the connection, is to refer it to the awaking in the morning of the resurrection; and there is .nothing in the language itself, or in the known sentiments of the psalmist, to forbid this interpretation. . . . 'With thy likeness.' Or, in thy likeness; that is, resembling thee. . . . I regard this passage, therefore, as one of the inci-dental proofs scat ered through the Old Testament, which show that the sacred writers under that dis-pensation believed in the doctrine of the resurrec-tion of the dead; that their language was often based on the knowledge and the belief of that doctrine, even when they did not expressly affirm it. and that in times of trouble, and under the consciousness of sin, they sought their highest consolation, as the people of God do now, from the hope and the expec-tation that the righteous dead will rise again, and that in a world free from trouble, from sin, and from death, they would live forever in the presence of God, and find their supreme happiness in being made wholly like him." E. J. W. fflissionam South Lancaster Academy. IT is now over two years since this school at South Lancaster, Mass., was first started. The scarcity of laborers in the cause of God, and a feeling on the part of many that the influence, of the common schools at the present day is not best calculated to improve the morals of those attending them, were among the consid-erations which led the friends of the enterprise to put tbrth efforts to establish this school. It began as an experiment, those in charge believ-ing that if they would have a school which should prove a success, it must be by adopting those principles which are adapted to call out the judgment, and fit individuals for usefulness in society. We have now passed through seven terms of the school, and we look back over its history with wrath satisfaction as to the results. Dur-ing the two years which the school has been in progress there have been over thirty conver-sions among those connected with it. Many came to the school unconverted, some of whom had little or no faith in the Bible. Most of these individuals have not only given their hearts to God, but have connected themselves with his work. In these respects God has most signally blessed the, school, and we feel to give him all the praise. and trust in his mercy and hope for his special blessing to accompany the efforts in the future. Two other schools have been started by teachers who came here to acquaint themselves with our methods of teaching. One of these schools is in Jamaica, Vermont, and the other at Rome, New York. The results of both of these thus far are very encouraging. Last winter, at a meeting of the leading brethren in the New England Conference, it was voted to raise the sum of $25,000, purchase land, and erect buildings suitable to carry out the design of those who led off in this enter- prise. Accordingly stock to the amount of over $12,500 was subscribed at the meeting, twenty-six acres of land were immediately purchased, and in the spring they proceeded to erect two buildings capable of accommodating following verses, in which it is said that he who is in Christ keeps the law of God; he walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;" in other words," he is a new creature." This argument is not complete without verses 3 and 4 of the 8th chapter: "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in,  the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." What could not the law do? It could not justify any man, and give him life. Wherein lay its weak-ness? Not in itself, but in "the flesh." It is the fault of man that the law condemns him, and not the fault of the law. The law cannot give life, be-cause it has been violated. And in this extremity what did God do? He sent his own Son. What for? That the righteousness of the law (i e., the law in its perfectness) might be accomplished by us. What we could not do while yet in bondage to sin, we may perform when we become free men in Christ. Righteousness is required of us, and that mean that there is something for us to do, for righteous-ness is simply right doing. But Christ says, " With-out me ye can do nothing." Our own righteousness, that is, the good that we attempt to do by our own unaided efforts, amounts to nothing. It is not right-eousness at all, but unrighteousness. When, how-ever, we join the strength of Christ to our weakness, we can truly say, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." IL J. W. The Resurrection. WE have seen that the object of our Lord's second coming is to take his people to himself. It has also been shown that Christ's coming is not at the death of saints, but that the only coining spoken of is a literal, personal coming in power and glory. From .1ohn 14: 1-3 we drew the necessary conclusion that if his coming (yet in the future) is for the express purpose of taking his people to himself, then none of his people can be with him until he comes. This fact is plainly stated by Paul in the eleventh of Hebrews. After having given a list of the faithful ones "of whom the world was not worthy,"Šthose who "through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of Ł the sword, out of weakness were made strong," verses 33,34,Šas well as those who "had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, more-over, of bonds and imprisonments," the apostle con-cludes thus: "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect." Verses 39, 40. This is an explicit statement that even the martyrs of old must wait for their reward until we who are alive receive ours. And this is exactly what our Saviour said. As lie was one day eating in the house of a Pharisee, he took occasion to give some instruction concerning hospitality. Said he: "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen. nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind; and thou shalt he blest; for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." Luke 14: 12-14. There is to be but one reward given. Of those who looked for a return for their charities in this life, who gave alms to be seen of men, the Lord said, "They have their reward." Matt. 6:1, 2. The ap-plause of men, or an equivalent for the gift. is all they need expect; but those who live lives of unself-ishness shall receive an everlasting recompense "at
