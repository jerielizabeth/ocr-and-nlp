AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 477 The Crater of Vesuvius. Da. C. L. GOODELL, at the First Congrega-tional Church, describes his visit to Vesuvius last month as follows:Š: "Leaving your carriage at the mountain rail-way, you enter the car. The ascent is very steep and at one place almost perpendicular. The road makes no curve. The car moves rap-idly, and in ten minutes you are within less than a half-hour's walk of the crater. You mount a chair, and four stalwart mountaineers bear you through smoke and steam, midst the rumbling of the volcano and the melted lava, to the very edge of the bowl, in which, as in a mighty caul-dron, the fiery mass seethes and rocks and thun-ders and foams. It is terrifically grand. The mountain seems filled with surging fire that rises up every half minute in awful explosion, throwing ap columns of smoke dark as midnight and streaked with lurid fire. This melted matter falls back with crashing,, fearful sound, lodging in part on the edge of the crater. Before you are recovered from one stunning sensation, another explosion breaks on you, more overpowering than before, the steam coming up through every crevice at your feet, and the whole summit is enveloped in cloud. The red lava, as it is thrown high in air in massive form, seems heated in the furnace of Vulcan, and as it falls back down into the boil-ing sea of fire, the sight is no more terrible than the noise is astounding. The crater seems like a mighty pit of liquid fire thrown up in burning waves from side to side, scorching, blistering, and tearing all before it. How can the mount-ain endure such a strain ? How can the eye bear such blinding brilliance of vast masses of fire? The crater is two miles in circumference, and you must make the circuit. The terror of the upheaving fire, and shower of ashes, and smoke, and stones, does not abate. The trem-bling of the mountain strikes terror into strong nerves. You remember the tragical death of the elder Pliny nearly 2,000 years ago, and the thousands that have been destroyed since. The explosions continue to deafen you. You remem-ber the lone city of Pompeii, where you have spent the morning, and you decide not to spend the summer there. It is the most sublime scene I ever witnessed. Nothing before ever made so deep and tremen-dous an impression. It is the most active vol-cano in the world. Smoke never ceases to float off from it as a long pennant from the head, and the crater never fails to show fire to those who visit it, and it may be seen almost every night from Naples. But on this bright day in March it spoke with a tongue of fire and a blackness of darkness never to be forgotten. Its words were red-hot bowlders, and its periods were rib-bons of crimson.ŠSt. Louie Globe-Democrat. The Mormon Temple. AT the founding of Salt Lake City, one square was set apart as the "Temple Block" for holy use. This vas intended to be not only the spir-itual but the geographical center of the city. On this ten-acre lot the Mormons held their first worship; here were built the structures now known as the Endowment House and the Assembly Hall; here, later on, the combined vol-untary labor of the members of the church erected the first tabernacle, and here were laid the foundations of the temple, which is still in-complete. This temple is to be a tall, many-turreted building of white granite, which is almost as white and crystalline as marble, and unexcelled as ma-terial for an imposing structure. The granite is brought from Little. Cotton-wood Canon, where it is split from enormous detached fragments that have fallen from the cliffs. It was for-merly hauled into the city by ox teams, but is now brought by rail. The templ3 was planned by Brigham Young. The style is one un- knov-n to architectural schools, but is said to more nearly resemble the Gothic than any other. The structure is of Cyclopean strength; its base, far below the surface, is sixteen feet in thickness, decreasing to nine feet in thickness at the sur-face. One course of the basement stones stands in the shape of a series of solid reversed arches. Above, the walls rise nearly seven feet in thick-ness to the present height of eighty feet, which is nearly to where the roof begins. There is no hollowness or "filling" or brick-workŠnothing but solid chiseled granite through and through, not only the outer walls, but in the partitions, the ceilings, and the stairways. The window openings are like the embrasures of a fort, and the heavily-walled compartments of the base-ment suggest the direst dungeons. All the externals of the building have a religious sig-nificance. It is said that Brigham Young's in-tention was that the building should last a thousand years. This enormous temple is not intended as a place of worship, but as a sacred edifice in which various ceremonies of consecra-tion, marriage, etc., shall be performed that are now celebrated in the Endowment House. For this purpose the whole building is cut up into little cloister-like rooms. The cost of the temple, which during thirty years has been building, is said to be, in round numbers, about $2,000,000. It is supposed that three years more time and another million dollars will complete it. It is doubtful whether there is in the United States another building so massive and genuine.ŠHarper's Monthly. Some Curious Facts. GOLD-BEATERS, by hammering, can reduce gold leaves so thin that 282,000 must be laid upon each other to produce the thickness of an inch, yet each leaf is so perfect and free from holes that one of them laid upon any surface, as in gilding, gives the appearance of solid gold. They are so thin that if formed into a book, 1,500 would only occupy the space of a single leaf of common paper; and an octavo volume of an inch thick, would have as many pages as the books of a well-stocked library of 1,500 volumes, with 400 pages in each. Still thinner than this is the coating of gold upon the silver wire of what is called gold lace, and we are not sure that such coating is not of only one atom thick. Platinum and silver can be drawn into wire much finer than human hair. A 'grain of blue vitriol of carmine will tinge a gallon of water, so that in every drop the color may be perceived. A grain of musk will scent a room for twenty years, and will, at the end of that period, have lost little of its weight. The carrion crow smells its food many miles off. A burning taper, un-covered for a single instant, during which it does not lose one-thousandth of a grain, would fill with light a sphere four miles in diameter, so as to be visible in every part of it. The thread of the silk-worm is so small that many of them are twisted together to form the finest sewing thread; but that of' the spider is smaller still, for two drams of it by weight would reach from London to Edinburgh, or 400 miles. In the milt of a codfish, or in water in which vegetables have been infused, the microscope discovers animal-culie of which many thousands together do not equal in bulk a grain of sand; and yet nature with a singular prodigality, has supplied many of these with organs as complete as those of the whale or the elephant, and their bodies con-sist of the same substance, or ultimate atoms, as that of than himself. In a single pound of such matter there are more living creatures than of human beings on the face of the globe. What a scene has the microscope opened to the admiration of the philosophic inquirer.ŠCas-sell's Saturday Journal. THE largest school in the world, probably, is the Jews' free school in London.

THESE volumes describe the great conflict between Christ and Satan, as illustrated in the history of man, his temptations, conflicts, victories and defeats, and the final triumph of right and truth with a crowning immortality. Volume one treats of the rebellion of Satan, the fall of man, and the lives of the patriarchs to the tame of .Solomon. Volumes two and three are devoted to the Life of Christ and the Ministry of his Apostles. Volu ne four contains sketches of the history of the Church from the destruction of Jerusalem to the close of time. These books are not argumentative, yet they throw much light on the sacred page. They afford especial encouragement to the Chris-tian, and are excellent to place in the hands of skeptics to convince them of Bible truth. The four volumes contain over 1,600 pages, and are furnished to the subscriber fjr $4.00 per set. Either volume may be furnished separately for $1.00, post-paid. See " State Agents' Directory," on page 430 of this paper, for names and addre s of our State Agents They will furnish you descriptive circulars, etc., upon application. Write to them.
