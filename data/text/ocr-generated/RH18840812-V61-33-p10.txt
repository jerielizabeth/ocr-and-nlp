522 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 10[VoL. 61, No. 33. and Aug. 1, 1884, some $23,000 in all has been paid on these pledges, leaving as much more un- paid. The REVIEW AND HERALD Office has during this time paid out over $20,000 of these funds to- ward sustaining the missions. With the excep- tion of the European Mission fund, which has several thousand dollars to its credit; the other three have but a few hundred dollars on hand ; and the English Mission has overdrawn its ac- count nearly $500. We state these facts for the benefit of our people everywhere, knowing their interest in these objects, that those who have made pledges, and have not paid them, may see the im- portance of doing so as soon as consistent. The themoney will be needed. The REVIEW Office, with — many drafts upon it, cannot carry these funds at the present time, when they are overdrawn. With all our building operations, which require so much means the present year, and with the heavy indebtedness of the Tract Societies and some of our other institutions to the Office , it cannot  reasonably be asked to carry more burdens. The pledges made on these four mission funds last year should be collected where they are due if possible. They were left in the hands of the different State Tract Societies for collection. Will not the Presi- dent and Secretary of each State Society look after this matter at once, and try to collect as many of them as possible, so that these funds may not be left empty, and our missionaries either be left in want, or the over-burdened Office be forced to carry them? We ask for this immediate attention and action. If it is looked after, as it should be, by the time of the camp-meeting in each Conference, thousands of dollars may be received, and the help will be ' greatly appreciated in this special time. G. I. B. In regard to the authenticity of this epistle as coming from the Barnabas who was the companion of Paul in his labors, learned men are generally agreed that it is spurious. Testimonies to this ef- fect might be quoted from Mosheim, Neander, Prof. Stuart, Dr. Killen, 'Prof. Hackett, Milner, Kitto, "Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,,,  E'usebius, Sir Wm. Doraville, and Coleman. From the last mentioned we give the following, which is in harmony with all the others :Š "The epistle of Barnabas, bearing the honored name of the companion of Paul in his missionary labors, is evidently spurious. It abounds in fab- ulous narratives, mystic, allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament, and fanciful conceits, and is generally agreed by the learned to be of no author-ity We are authorized by all these testimonies to treat this epistle as a forgery. And yet this is the only writing, except the New Testament, pur-porting to come from the first century, in which the first day of the week is even alluded to ; and Mosheim is one of the number of those who con- demn it. Where, then, does he find the evidence that in the first century "all Christians were unanimous" in the observance of the first day of the week, and that this custom was derived from the example of the church at Jerusalem, and the " express appointment of the apostles 7" Ts not the testimony of Neander more in accordance with the evidence from history, or rather the want of any evidence of that kind, namely, that "the fes- tival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was al-ways only a human ordinance " 7, The next writing in the order of time which is claimed as an evidence in favor of Sunday-keeping in the early church is the letter of Pliny, the Roman governor of Bithynia, to the emperor Trajan, writ- ten about A. D. 104. He says of the Christians of his province :Š " They affirmed that the whole of their guilt or error was, that they met on a certain stated day, before it was light, and addressed themselves in a form of prayer to Christ, as to some god, binding themselves by a solemn oath, not for the purpose of any wicked design, but never to com- mit any fraud, theft, or adultery ; never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up ; after which it was their custom to separate, and then re-assemble to eat in common a harmless meal." nothing of S d proves in favor Sunday This epistleand observance. Coleman candidly speaks of it as fol- lows :Š "This statement is evidence that these Chris- tians kept a day as holy time, but whether it was the last or the first day of the week does not ap-pear." Tertullian, who wrote A. D. 200, evidently saw nothing in this epistle in favor of the observance of the first day of the week ; for when speaking of this very epistle of Pliny he says :Š "He found in their religious services nothing but meetings at early morning for singing 'hymns to Christ and God, and sealing home their way of life by a united pledge to be faithful in their relig- ion, forbidding murder, adultery, dishonesty, and other crimes." Mr. W. B. Taylor speaks of this stated day of Pliny as follows :Š " As the Sabbath day appears to have been quite as commonly observed at this date as the sun's day (if not even more so), it is just as prob- able that this ' stated day' referred to by Pliny was the seventh day, as that it was the first day ; though the latter is generally taken for granted." Yes ; taking for granted the very point to be proved is the only means of defending a false po- sition. Although Mosheim depends on this letter Pliny as a chief evidence for Sunday observ-ante, yet he was aware that learned men were of a different opinion. On this point he very frankly says :Š "B. Just. Hen. Boehmer would indeed have us far from the intentions of the apostles to estab-  " Lastly he saith unto them, Your new moonsdren to understand this day to have been the same with the Jewish Sabbath." On this letter of Pliny, Eld. J. N. Andrews sums up the evidence as follows :Š "This testimony of Pliny was written a few years subsequent to the time of the apostles. It relates a church whica had been foundedto  by the apostle Peterh pro  . Itb  isbly  certainly far more probable that this church, only forty years after the death of Peter, was keeping the fourth commandment, than that it was observing a day never enjoined by divine authority. It must be conceded that this testimony from Pliny proves nothing in support of Sunday observance ; for it does not designate what day of the week was thus observed." R. F. COTTRELL. IMPORTANT FOR OHIO. THUS far we have been able to secure reduction of fare on the following railroads running into Columbus : Those coming from Bowling Green, II amler, Van Wert, Dunkirk, and all from the northwest part of the State, and those south of Columbus, should strike the C. H. V. and T. R. R. at the nearest point, and pay full fare to Colum- bus. They will be returned at one cent per mile over that road. Those at Clyde, Springfield, Yel- low Springs, and all near the line of the I. B. and W. R. R., will buy excursion tickets at regu- lar excursion rates. Those coming from Mendon, Walnut Grove, Bellefontaine, and St. Mary's, can obtain reduction of fare from Covington, Piqua, obtain reduction of fare from Covington, Piqua, and Urbana ; or any that desire to come over the lines of the P. C. and St. L. R. R., or the C. St. L. and P. R. R. from the west or east part of the State, can buy round-trip tickets at one-third discount by applying to me for certificates. Those from Nor- walk, Bellville, Corsica, Waterford, Newark, or all that wish to go over the B. and 0. R. R., can, by applying to me for a certificate, buy round-trip tickets at one-third reduction. These certificates must be presented to the regular ticket agent where you purchase your tickets. Those who fail to secure these certificates will get no reduction on these roads. Elders and leaders of the various  churches should send to me immediately for the number wanted, and see that every person, in and out of the church, who will go to the camp-meet- ing is provided with one. Those coming from Cleveland, Akron, and the northeast part of the State, will buy tickets at those points at one-third, perhaps one-half, discount over the Cleveland, Mt. Vernon, and Delaware R. R. Those at Well- ington, Spencer, Camden, and Wakeman, can strike the B. and 0. R. R. at Shelby and get the reduction by obtaining the certificates, or they can buy round-trip tickets on the C. C. C. and I. R. R. Those in the eastern part of the State will probably get a reduction over the N. Y. P. and 0. R. R. to Akron, where they will take the C. Mt. V. and D. R. R. If so we will notify them by letter. each church select two or three of its mem-bees s to come upon the ground with their small tent the first of the week to help put the ground ' readiness, and thus lighten the burdens. All should be on' the ground Wednesday night, that we may begin our meetings Thursday with no in- terruption. We much desire to see our leading brethren as early as Tuesday, that we may hold counsel meetings before the meeting begins. REMEMBER THE CHILDREN. Especial effiarts will be made to help the youth and children. We expect Eld. I. D. Van Horn will have charge of the children's meetings. Those present last year will not be willing that their chil- should lose these meetings for trifles. One sister writes : " I must go to camp-meeting with my six children. It will cost $23 for the R. R. fare, besides the expense on the ground. This means I Will have to earn. God willing, they must go." How many more mothers are there who feel a burden for their children 1 One church writes that " not a single family will be left at home." Make no preparations to return home till Tuesday, Sept. 23. Excellent help from the Ł THE SABBATH AND THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRIS- TIAN ERA.ŠNO. 2. Two eminent modern church historians, Mos- heini of the eighteenth century and Neander of the nineteenth, directly contradict each other in respect to the standing of Sunday in the first cen- tury. Of this century Mosheim testifies as fol- lows :Š Christians were unanimous in setting apart the first day of the week, on which the tri- umphant Saviour arose from the dead, for the solemn celebration of public worship. This pious custom, which was derived from the example of the church of Jerusalem, was founded upon the express appointment of the apostles, who consecra- ted that day to the same sacred purpose, and was observed universally throughout the Christian churches, as appears from the united testimony of the most credible writers." Neander says :Š " The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance ; and it was lish a divine command in this respect; far from them, and from the early apostolic church, to trans- fer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had begun to take place ; for men ap- pear by that time to have considered laboring on Sunday as a sin." Now all the writings that have come down to a us from the first 140 years of the Christian era, which speak of the first day of the week, are the New Testament and the so-called epistle of Bar- nabas. This epistle speaks of first-day observance as follows :Š and your Sabbaths I cannot bear them. Consider what he means by it ; the Sabbaths, says he, which ye now keep, are not acceptable unto me, but those which I have made ; when resting from all things,of I shall begin the eighth day, that is, the beginning of the other world ; for which cause we observe the eighth day with gladness, in which Jesus arose from the,  dead, and having manifested himself to his disciples, ascended into heaven."
