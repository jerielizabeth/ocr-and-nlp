THE HEALTH REFORMER. 29.3 Where Reform Is Needed among the Farming Community. BY W. T. CURRIE, A. N., M. D. PERHAPS some may not be able to see the force of the historical argument presented in my last article, and may ask why I speak as I do. History repeats itself. What has been, will be. The laws of God are unalterable, and he has inseparably connected certain results to certain methods of action. Therefore, when we have learned from the past the operation of any law, we know what to look for in the future. Mankind are by nature selfish. Now start any reform, and the very first thing that the mass of the people think of is whether or not they can gain some personal advantage by join-ing in the movement, and they are so greedy that they want this immediately. Commence a political agitation. Many will rush into it, hoping for some fat office or other emolument ; but just as soon as there are any signs of defeat, they will turn their backs upon the cause they were defending, and trample under foot the very men who had been their chosen leaders. No great reform can be carried on without a tone of moral earnestness on the part of those engaged in it. In war, a soldier is valued ac-cording to what he is willing to suffer for the cause. So it is in reform movements. The value of any adherent to the cause may be es-timated by the personal sacrifices he is willing to make. Personal reform brings to birth this spirit of self-sacrifice. It develops moral great-ness. It so fixes the minds of men upon the need of social and political reforms that they are willing to undergo great hardships to carry them through. Give such men efficient leaders, no mere money power, and no superiority of numbers, can successfully withstand them. Let us now notice some evils complained of by those leading in the farmer's movement, and then I will endeavor to show how personal re-forms will pave the way to remove these evils, and make success possible. We are told that the farming community are oppressed by capi-talists, who form rings for the purpose of con-troling the price of products, and that legislation favors these capitalists so much that the farm-ers, as a class, are in great danger of being re-duced to a condition of poverty and ignorance. Now, I do not apprehend that there is any danger that the farmers of this country will ever be reduced to a condition quite so bad as that of the ancient Roman husbandmen de-scribed in the history which I quoted. Still, the signs of the times give the greatest cause for alarm to the farmers as a class, and to the whole nation, for the reason that the safety and stabil- ity of any nation depends in great part upon the character and condition of its agricultural people. It does not require any great spirit of  divination to predict that, unless some change be made, the time is not far distant when a great portion of the lands of the West will fall into the hands of capitalists, and the real work-ing population of the country will be reduced to the condition of renters and dependents. This transformation is already going on in many parts of the country. In other parts, the Amer-ican population is being entirely supplanted by foreigners. These will occupy the land for a generation or two, when the same fate will over-take their descendants. Take any family among the farmers, and follow its fortunes. In the sec-ond, third, or fourth generation, the children of the richest will be reduced to the condition of renters. This kind of transformation is going on all the time, and it is no wonder that the farmers have sounded the alarm. But what is the source from which so great dangers are threatened I believe it is the ex-istence Of certain evils which have crept into the farming communities from the contact with the cities and towns adjoining. The evils to which I refer may be classed under the general head of luxurious living. I say this, I know, at the risk of being considered absurd. Some will even laugh at my proposition as ridiculous. They will tell us that the farmers are mostly too poor to afford any luxuries, and that they deny themselves many of the comforts of life that they may add something to their small capital. I grant that all this is true, and still I hold that my statement is correct. The farmers are not all poor. Some have become quite wealthy. As a rule, I believe they acquire property quite as fast as those en-gaged in any manual labor. But an increase of property does not always bring with it an increase of blessings. It often proves a curse. So often is this the case, that it is a question for serious consideration whether any commu-nity can become wealthy without becoming so corrupted by this wealth as to insure its cer-tain decline, and ultimate degeneracy and ruin. Unless some radical reforms are introduced into the farming communities of our country, just as fast as they become wealthy, they will be cor- rupted by luxury. But it is not the wealthy alone who are corrupted. The poorer classes imitate the rich, and are thus kept in poverty. This is one peculiar feature of American life. So, if the farmers could once succeed in put-ting down all the powers which oppose them, and gain twice the present compensation for their labor, although this would undoubtedly improve their appearance, according to the opinion of the world, yet it might not really improve their condition. Indeed, if the addi-tional amount of income were spent on corrupt-ing luxury, it would make their condition worse instead of better. But is it true that the farmers and their fam-ilies are corrupted by luxurious living I and, is
