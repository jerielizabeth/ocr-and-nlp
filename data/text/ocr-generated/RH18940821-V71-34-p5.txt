OUR SONS AS PI. &NTS. PS. 144: 12. BY '1'. Ii. WILLIAMSON. (Talln(adge, How does a plant grow up in its youth? Comely, and straight, and tall, and fair; Swaying in every breeze with grace, It looks e'en the dazzling sun in the face, As with conscious nobleness born of truth, And a fine, innocent air. These are Bible plants that I write about, Not noxious weeds by miry roads; Young palms that grow toward the stars, Supple, and lithe, and courageous as Mars, That can firmly stand though the battle's rout Is swept from the field by bayonet .goads. A boy or a man on whose strong arm A mother can lean with loving trust; Life soldier in the church of Christ; Ready either for work or sacrifice. Who will side with the weak 'gainst pain and harm, If that side be but true, and the cause be just. 0 glorious planting of God's own hand, Comely and pleasant, true and fair! Grow up to stand like monarch trees, Like hearts of oak that in tempest or breeze Reach kindly arms o'er the needy land, And your crowns of usefulness royally wear. HOSPITALITY. SoME years ago we used frequently to pass two homes, with the inmates of which we never be-came acquainted ; but which have each left a deep impression upon the mind. In one case the house stood far back from the road, and at the gate was a warning-board with, "Beware of the Dog !" printed thereon. There was no sign of _comfort or welcome on the premises. The back door was where the front door should be ; no tree with grateful shade, nor flower with winning beauty, nor any other sign, invited the traveler to stop. We were always thankful that there was no occasion for doing so, -for behind that board there seemed to be a savage brute of a dog; and behind the dog a man whose best friend was the dog. The next house faced the road ; it was a cot-tage whose door generally stood open, revealing homely comfort. Before the door were many beds of smiling flowers, which greeted the pass-ei-by with the fragrance of a pure and thankful life. A flourishing vine arched the gateway, upon which " Welcome" seemed to be written in living green. Looking beyond the bull-dog and the man, and beyond the vine and the flowers, we see prin-ciples. On one side exclusiveness and cold-hearted selfishness ; on the other hospitality, sympathy, and kindness. Christ came to earth a homeless stranger. His own received him not. To lay his head, he had no place. From the depth of a heart that knew loneliness and friend-lessness he fervently taught lessons of hospital-ity. He attaches to the smallest acts, as of giving a cup of water, an eternal reward. To his enemies he says reproachfully, " I was a stranger, and ye took me not in." They had turned him from their doors in the persons of his humble children. We are prone to excuse ourselves -from re-ceiving strangers to our houses, and in these days it would seem that some caution is de-manded. But to feed a hungry wanderer, who is somebody's son, to give him warmth at our firesides, and to cause him to feel the cheer of kindly words, the warm influence of Christian love, is a gift which every one who loves the homeless Jesus should not fail to bestow!  and to which the lowest of our fellow-creatures is -en- ° titled. But some of us need to learn easier lessons in hospitality. The lines of exclusiveness which we have drawn around our homes are between us and our neighbors. Our brethren and sisters stand outside. They are not invited to feel the warmth of our fireside companionship. Perhaps a meeting is in progress, strangers are there,, but we carefully avoid inviting them to our homes. 0, it is so much trouble. We have all we can do without them. There is no vacant room at Ł the table. And other excuses come up which seem to us to justify us in drawing closer our selfish exclusiveness. And we congratulate ourselves when the opportunity for being kind and cordial has passed, and we have escaped without having had to expend any of those precious qualities. Such is not Christianity. There is more of the '' beware " than of the flowersŠmore of self and less of Thee. G. C. T. " SOMETIME YOU WILL THANK ME." "MAMA," said Nellie Alton, half reproach-fully, "you can't have forgotten that it is just a week to-day since I received that invitation to Minnie Shelburne's party. You said at the time that you.did n't know whether I might accept, and I think I have been very patient not to tease you about it. Almost all the girls are going. Mrs. Doane has bought the loveliest silk for Car-rie and Jessie Ł, and Mrs. Hilton has three women sewing on Emma's dress. Here I am, not knowing whether I can go. Cousin Sue said she thought my mother a woman of great deliberation.' " " In years to come you will rejoice over the truth of that remark, my darling." " But, mama, please decide now, won't you ? " " I have decided, my dear. Last night your father and I had a long talk about the matter, and we agreed Š" " To let me go ? " cried.eager Nellie. " No, dear. Anxious -for your truest good, we were sorry we should have to disappoint ,you. But we cannot grant you a harmful pleasure." Nellie bit her lip, while her eyes filled with tears. "May I ask your reasons, mama ? " " Yes, dear ; and I feel that my sensible lit-tle daughter cannot but be satisfied with them. All the advantages you are now having tend to make you,,at some future time, a useful woman in society. To obtain their full benefit, your mind must remain undiverted from your studies, and yourself kept free from everything that will detract from your health and strength. Parties will excite you, deprive you of sleep, fill your mind with foolish fancies, retard you in your school work, and Make you thin, pale, and irrita-ble. We would sadly miss our bright, blooming Nellie. Do you wonder .we refuse to let you at-tend the party? " " But just once cannot hurt me," pleaded Nellie. " The one party, my child, will be followed by a score of them. If you go to Miss Shel-burne's, the other girls will wonder why you cannot attend theirs, and ill feeling will arise. We will talk no more about it now. Sometime you will thank me for my course. Are you sat-isfied ? " " I '11 try to be, mama," said Nellie ; but there were a few suspicious drops on -her eye-lashes. The night of the party arrived. Nellie had had a very trying -week at school ; for the girls thought of nothing else besides their fine prep- arations. She bore it bravely, and after tea sat resolutely down to her lessons, which were unusually difficult. Half-past eight found her closing her books with the air of a conqueror, while she exclaimed,Š "Now, mama, they 're all done, every one. May I run over and see Cousin Sue off ? " Consent was given, and Nellie entered her uncle's vestibule just as Sue was descending the stairs, in a cloud of lace and pink silk. She  felt a little choking in her throat, but said quietly, " Sue, you look lovely ; but to-morrow's French exercise is terribly hard." " And Miss Propriety Stay-at-Home has pre-pared for it, I infer. Are n't you sorry you can't go'? " said Sue, settling her flounces with a satisfied air. " Mother knows best," said Nellie, decidedly ; then she went home. While her sixth hour of sleep, sweet and restful, was passing by, poor, tired, cross Sue returned home, and wearily climbed upstairs to her room. Next day Nellie came home, saying, " I am at the head of all my classes. Some of the girls were late, others had headaches, all of them were disagreeable, and none of them had half prepared their lessons. Professor Marshly was very angry, but he thanked me for my good ex-ample to the others. You dearest mother ! '11 trust you as long as I live." Years afterward, two ladies were seated in a pleasant room engaged in coversation. One of them reclined on a sofa, and her sallow features and restless, dissatisfied manner marked her an invalid. The face of the other was bright with health and vivacity. Her sunny smile and cheery voice showed her a stranger to sickness and pain. " Nellie, my dear," sighed the former, " you can have no idea of the dreadful condition of my nervous system. I spend the greater part of the day on the sofa. The children are a perfect wor-riment, everything about the house goes wrong, and Ralph looks so discontented. I cannot en-joy society at all. In fact, the doctor says-  I had too much dissipation when young, and ruined my constitution with parties and late suppers. I would give my fortune for your good health and cheerful spirits." " Cousin Sue, I remember when you used to drive off to parties, and think scornfully of my quiet home evenings." " I remember, Nellie. Do hand me the harts.; horn and another cushion, and please lower that shade a little. There, thank you. Now will you inform me to what you owe your healthy, happy life ? " At this moment the door opened, and a silver-haired, sweet-faced lady entered. Nellie rose to meet her, and twining one arm about the lady's waist, she said, " Cousin Sue, my fitrfect health, my calm, happy mind, the good I am enabled to do for God and humanity, the comfort I succeed in giving to my husband and children, the knowledge I have of my heavenly Father and the love I bear him, I owe to the judicious care, the wise counsel, and the tender love and prayers of my mother." Selected. CORN. BY MRS. D. A. FITCH. (Sanitarium Cooking School.) ALTHOUGH it is not now our privilege to eat of the corn of heaven, as did the children of Israel, we may make large use of the corn of earth provided by Heaven, a food holding a place in the original bill of fare, and one, too, which contains the elements necessary for the maintenance of the body. In its natural state, it contains eighty-five per cent of nutrition ; but if first fed to animals and then taken in the form of flesh food, a large percentage of the nutriment is lost, since the best of these foods contain only one third the amount found in the grain. Thus much more land is required to support a flesh-eating people than those who subsist on the natural products of the earth. For this and other reasons the people of God will soon be found partaking only of the foods best suited to their needs. On page 49 of "Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," we read : "Again and again I have been shown that God is trying to lead us a
