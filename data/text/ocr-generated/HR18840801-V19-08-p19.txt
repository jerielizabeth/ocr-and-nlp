GOOD PIMArirPi. 243 One evening we made an excursion down into the poorest quarter of the city. We could not see that it looked much different from the rest, however, as Naples certainly contains more poverty to the square rod than any other city we ever saw or heard of. But perhaps in the "poor quarter," the poverty is a trifle more impoverished and more numerous than else-where. Here the lazzaroni of Italy appear in all their glory, which consists chiefly in dirt, disease and deformity, vice and vagrancy, rags and rascality. Never were we surrounded by such a set of ruffianly rag-muffins as gathered round our carriage when we came to a halt in the very heart of the most poverty-stricken portion of the poorest city in Christendom. Our cab had stopped just before the stand of a mac-aroni vender, who carried on his business at the edge of the side-walk, supplying his customers from a big pot, which he kept boiling by a little charcoal fur-nace. Thinking it would be the wisest policy to se-cure the good graces of our villainous looking spec-tators, we, through our guide, instructed the mac-aroni man to supply the crowd with boiled " pipe stems" at our expense. The thing was understood at once, and the mob made a rush for the macaroni vender which threatened to annihilate him. The poor fellow managed to keep his feet, however, and ladled out dish after dish of the limber food, which was no sooner dished up than devoured by the hun-gry fellows, who fought and scrambled for the steam-ing food as though it was the first atom of nourish-ment they had seen for a month. Sometimes, in the scramble, the pewter plate was upset, and the mac-aroni was squirming around on the dirty side-walk in consequence. But a little dirt, or a good deal, is evidently of small account in this country. At any rate, it did not seem to diminish the lazzaroni appe-tite in the slightest degree, and the slippery food was quickly rescued from the pavement, and by the aid of the fingers of both hands, which were con-stantly thrust into the wide-open mouth, disappeared into the unknown region of a lazzaroni stomach. We paid our bill, seventy-five centimes (fifteen cents),Šand drove off, leaving the wriggling, wrang-ling mass of humanity fighting for the last half inch of macaroni. Where else in the world is food so cheap as in Italy! and yet the poverty is so extreme that even the cheapest food is almost beyond the reach of thousands of persons in the larger cities, especially of Southern Italy. This brings us to the subject of beggars, of whom the first thing we may say is that the beggars of It_ aly beggar description. One soon learns to recognize the Italian beggar, however, as he is omni-present, hovering about the doors of every hotel; swarming at the entrances of all the churches; peopling the in- terior of many of the sacred edifices; exhibiting his hideous deformities at every corner; darting upon you from hidden recesses, and from behind the bro-ken pillars of old ruins; jostling you in the crowded  streets, where men, women, and children, horses, wagons, and carts, are all mixed in inextricable con-fusionŠcrying forever " Signore, Signore," in the most plaintive voice, and with a countenance repre-senting a picture of the most agonizing suffering, and the most despairing woe, and constantly rapping his lower jaw with his hand to signify his hunger. The beggar of Naples is the most numerous inhabitant. Covered with vermin, not more than half clothed by his filthy rags, pensive by habit, a hypocrite by trade, Šfor the majority of them are able-bodied, but too lazy to work,Šthe average beggar of this benighted country is a disgrace to his profession; and the daily contact of the traveler with him is well calculated to harden his heart, and destroy his little remaining faith in humanity. No doubt many of the beggars really fare better than the honest, laboring people who toil all day for a small pittance. In a good many instances, these beggars have been found to have ac-cumulated considerable sums, although the majority probably spend the most of their gains in the pur-chase of lottery tickets, the sale of which is encour-aged by the Government, which holds a monopoly of the lottery business. Another time we will tell our readers our impres-sions of Italy from a health standpoint. A Possible Cholera Outbreak.ŠThe chol-era is raging in Southern France, and it is predicted by Prof. Kock that it will ex-tend to all Europe. The disease may also find its way to this country. Now is the time to get ready for it. Here are a few things to do : Avoid stimulants of every description. Exercise care in diet, to maintain a healthy condition of the stom-ach and bowels. To this end, flesh-meats, condiments, iced cream, and ices of every description should be avoided. The diet should consist mainly of milk, fruits, and grains. Clean up the premises. Disinfect and fill up the old privy vault. Look carefully after the drinking water, to see that it is not contaminated by poisonous organic matter from your own or your neighbor's vault, cess-pool, or sewer. A recent in-vestigation made by an Eastern health board, discovered one hundred and fifty wells thus poisoned, in two hundred and forty examined. Be temperate and cleanly, breathe pure air, eat pure food, drink pure water, and you need not be afraid of the cholera.
