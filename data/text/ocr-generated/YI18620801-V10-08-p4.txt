Name a prophecy which is not yet fulfilled. Mention some that are now fulfilling. ,r ;4 60 YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. YOUTH'S them "get into the sunshine" quickly as possible. INSTRUCTORŁ This I love to see. A sullen, mute, pouting child has by far the most unhappy disposition in the world. Nothing makes happiness more perfect to the pa-rent's heart than the cheerful, innocent counte-nances in the home circle. I would love to hear what each little one would say, could I ask them, what is the true source of happiness. May be some would call it play, or a ride, or a fishing excursion, or some other amuse-ment. But I will tell you what I think it is. The great fountain of all good and true happiness, is God, the creator of all things. Now there may be a source of happiness within every heart, small or great. A real fountain from which will flow all those little heavenly rills so essential to happiness ; just like the purling streams gushing up from some hidden fountain, rippling gently along, scattering blessings as they go. How beautiful they are. What would earth be without them? A dry desert. We could not live without them. Just as these lit-tle streams gush from the greater fountain, so may streams of love, cheerfulness, contentment, faith, and a multitude of others, course through the chan-nels of your hearts. To keep these little streams running, you must go to the great fountain for sup- plies. It is ever full and free. Prayer is the only way you can find access there. Seek some quiet spot and there ask God for those pleasant streams of happiness. Then let trouble come, let its dark floods flow down like the wide breaking in of waters, but your source of happiness fails not. Dear children there are scenes of trouble coming such as you nor I have ever known before. Al-ready we see it, and sometimes our hearts tremble; but let us believe that the wings of the Almighty overshadow us, and we are safe. Improve all the little golden privileges you have,Šthe Sabbath School and meetings. Let the Sabbath be a delight to you. I am glad to know by the response that comes back from many little hearts, that they love the In-structor. As month after month comes and goes, I trust its influence is not lost upon them; and when God's great harvest is past, oh may it have gathered in many tiny sheaves into the heavenly garner. M. D. A. For the Youth's Instructor. What shall I Say ? N taking up my pen again to write to the little Instructor friends, my thoughts have visited them East, West, North, and South. As I have seen the world fast filling up its cup of iniquity, and signs thickening that trouble such as we never knew of is right upon us, I have thought much about the true source of happiness. I have often questioned how we may possess it, young and old. I know children love to be happy, and many of What Next ? MONG the curiosities in the great Exhibition in London, says the American Messenger, is a machine for microscopic writing, which executes writing, or beautiful and complex curves, with wonderful precision and minuteness, though they are invisible to the naked eye. A cir-cle the one-hundredth part of an inch in diameter, which to the eye appears a mere point, will contain five circles of the three-hundreth part of an inch, in one of which, about the size of a transverse sec- AV;
