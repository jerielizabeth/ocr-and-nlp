GOOD 1-1MArirrisl. 233 and drinking. Intemperance may mean energetic action kept up too long in any one part to the injury of the rest or some other part. Teetotalers are apt to think that they can get wrong only through energetic drinking. But hard study will concentrate nervous power on the brain, and in consequence, weaken a man's stom-ach, as well as too much drinking. This is, indeed, the simple explanation of the common and well-known fact of so many literary men suffering from indigestion. Many of our great men have died at a comparatively early age from this over-balancing of energy. I do not doubt that a very great number, probably the great-est number, injure their bodily framework through excessive drinking. But this is only one form of intemperance. The les-son, the general lesson, for taking a broad and general view of the subject of the human body, is that God meant us to study it, and avoid undue pressure upon any one part or function which might bring damage to another part. The sys-tem is a natural balance, which we cannot disturb without loss. We need prudence in all things. My only objection to tee-total nostrums is thisŠthat being partial, they are not philosophicalŠnot based upon principles of a sufficiently wide application to be considered philosophically. I have no doubt good is done by total abstinence or temperance in drink, because harm is done by the opposite. But I have noticed so great a tendency to something like fanaticism or infatuation among .temper-ance advocates, that I have an opinion that some of them, having put the gag upon drink, have run riot, and injured their own constitution in other ways. Temperate in what they drink, they have fallen into a want of temperance in what they say. It is of little use to preach tem- perance in drinking, if we do not practice it in speaking. Let us, then, be temperate in all things, as well as in what we eat and drink. You will not misunderstand my remarks. I am no opponent of tem- perance societies. They do a partial good in so far as they restrain men from ex-cesses who could not be otherwise re- strained. But I am wishful to-night to take a wider philosophic view, advocating care for the whole man." ŠCalisthenics may be very genteel, and romping very ungenteel ; neverthe-less, the one is but the shadow, and the other the substance, of healthful exercise. MOTHERS. THERE is one class of the community for whom a vegetarian diet is necessary, even though all others refuse to abstainŠwomen who expect to become mothers. The habits of an expectant mother have great influence on her offspring ; women who live on a gross diet, and indulge in every food for which they have an incli-nation, entail a gross habit of mind and body on their infants. If women have any bad habits, they should repress them at that time ; they should fight against self-ishness, self-indulgence, cruelty, and ill-temper, because indulgence of these pas-sions entails the same dispositions on their offspring ; and under such circumstances they add to the world, not a blessing, but a curse. Women who are expecting to be-come mothers should live purely. They should look alone to fruit and the cereals for their diet. They should be careful that no blood is shed for them, and that no cruelty is practiced that they may feast; for such practices bring pain and misery on themselves at the time of birth, and cause evil dispositions in their children. We read of many illustrious births in the Scriptures, wherein the women were warned to live purely, and these injunc-tions had a far higher meaning than many at the present day understand. When chil-dren were set apart to be prophets and messengers to the Divine, the mothers were commanded to abstain from all gross living ; for how can mothers produce any-thing but gross creatures when gorging themselves with dead carcasses, drinking wine, indulging in laziness and ill-temper? What could children of such mothers be but mere animals? Mothers who are af-fectionate and loving, who wish to keep their offspring, and who wish them to grow up a blessing to themselves and to their neighbors, spare the young of the creatures that God has made ; do not rob the ewe of her lamb, the cow of her calf, or the hen of her chickens; spare to them the joys of maternity, if you wish to enjoy yours ; and though others may be the cause of shed-ding blood, let it not be shed for you. If you are wise and temperate and merciful, the little ones will come without pain to yourself, or anxiety to others, and you will not be troubled with those awful dis-eases which afflict flesh-eating mothers; you will have no little coffin lids to close down, and your offspring will be full of life and intelligence, free from disease and de-formity.Š Vegetarian Almanac.
