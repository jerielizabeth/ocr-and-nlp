244 GOOD PIIRATirPl. DANGER OF BATHING WHEN HEATED. THE London Lancet gives the following timely warning of the dangerous risk in-curred in bathing when heated and per-spiring:Š " A fine young fellow, a trooper in the 3d Dragoon Guards, then on the march from Edinburgh to Manchester, took ad-vantage of the night's halt to have a dip in the Wear near that city. Being strong, and a good swimmer, he took an oar, at which he worked for some time in the sultry evening till he came to deep water, and in a suitable place took his plunge. That he was immediately seized with cramp is evident from the statements of his companions, who, alarmed at his cries, hastened to render assistance, but he had sunk before they reached him, and he never rose again. When the body was recovered, a considerable time afterward, it bore every evidence of the cause of the disaster. It was described as being "twisted "Šthat is, contorted ; while the vessels of the head, especially in their gorged condition, pointed to congestion, in fact, to stagnation, of the circulation ! That this young soldier lost his life by bathing when in an overheated condition, is quite clear. "It would be well if soldiers and civil-ians would remember the lesson conveyed in the classical case of Alexander, quoted by Dr. Jones from Quintus Curtius, viz.: It was in the middle of one of the hot-test days of a burning summer that Alex-ander arrived on the banks of Cydnus. The freshness-,  and clearness of the water invited the king, covered with sweat and dust, to take a bath. He stripped himself of his clothes, and, his body all in a sweat, descended into the river. Hardly had he entered, when his limbs became sud-denly stiff, the body pale, and vital heat seemed by degrees to abandon him. His officers received him almost expiring in their arms, and carried him senseless to his tent.' " ŠAnxious thoughts disturb digestion. Toothsome Beef.ŠA writer in the Rail-way Review thus describes the manner in which live stock are transported to East-ern cities. Such food is undoubtedly tender and toothsome, but no one would seriously undertake to defend it as health-ful food for human beings :Š " The present fashion of transporting live stock is barbarous in the extreme; and if the cruelties perpetrated upon dumb beasts which are to be used as food were known, public sentiment would sup-press 'the whole business in short order. The writer recently saw a live stock train, upon one of the trunk lines, which made him heart-sick. The cattle were crowded into a car as closely together as they could stand ; it was a hot day ; all the animals were gasping for breath ; some, exhausted, had fallen, and were lying upon the filthy floor under their fellows. Whenever the train started, it jerked them back ; and when it stopped, it threw them forward. In this way they were to be carried a thousand miles, and when they arrived, bruised, sick, and fevered, at their jour-ney's end, the survivors were to be butch-ered to furnish meat for human beings." Ł Salt and Digestion.ŠDr. G. Hurson, a French physician, has been investigating the effects of salt and other condiments upon digestion. His experiments show that salt, in any but the most minute quan-tities, very materially impedes digestion. Even so small a quantity as 0.5 grammes, or seven and one-half grains, is sufficient to retard digestion; and the larger the quantity, the greater will be the gastric derangement. ŠA German writing master has devised a method of curing writer's cramp which he claims to be infallible. It consists in a combination of massage and gymnastics, or active and passive movements. ŠThe amount of water required daily by the average citizen for all purposes, is estimated by Dr. Parkes as about twelve gallons.
