58 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. may have anything to conceal ; then I shall not regret" the little trees."---Young Cru-sader. THE OHIO'S PETITION. Ova Father who in Heaven art, Give me a grateful, contrite heart, Make me a gentle, loving child, With temper meek, and passions mild. Oh! make me worthy of thy love, Send down thy Spirit from above; Increase my joys, soothe alllmy woes, And let me on thine arm repose. From early morn to dewy night, Be thou my heart's supreme delight; Direct my steps, control my will, And bid each angry thought be still. Dear Saviour, from thy throne on high Regard me with a gracious eye; Forgive my faults, my follies hide, Be thou my strength,Emy guard, and guide. Our Father who in Heaven art, Give me a new, and guiltless heart, Cleanse me from every secret sin, That I a golden crown may win. Through all life's dark and thorny ways Teach me thy tender love to praise, And when at last my race is run, Oh ! may I hear thee say, "Well done." Chromos. THERE'S no excuse for bare, gloomy walls now-a-days. Every cottage, and almost every shanty can afford some lively, bright, colored picture, that will comfort and brighten the lives lived out there. Thanks to a wonderful new way of mak-ing pictures, you can buy as pretty a picture for five dollars as you could a few years ago for five hundred. In fact, you can buy a copy of the five-hundred dollar picture so exact and perfect that you can't tell the dif-ference, and even an artist has to look sharp. The works I speak of are chromos, and the reason they are cheap is because of one lit-tle circumstanceŠthat grease and water won't mix. It seems rather funny that a simple thing like that should be the cause of such a wonderful effect, but I'll tell you how it is. What makes an oil painting expensive is, that an artist spent years in learning to paint, and then weeks and months on each picture. Every line and dot and shade is the work of his fine brush, and there are two or thre coats of paint over every part of the picture. The chromo is very different. It is not painted, but printed from Acme plates. The first thing, in making one, is to prepare as many of these plates as there are colors and shades of color in the picture. The stone is of a peculiar kind, which likes, or absorbs, both grease and water. It is sawed into plates, and polished by rubbing with sand and water. Still they are not smooth enough. The sand is washed, off, and again polished with fine pumice stone, till you can see your face in it. They are then examined with a Inicroscope, to see that there are no tiny holes, for one would spoil the picture. When perfectly smooth, they are set up slanting, in frames, and the artist goes to work. On the first stone, he draws, with a sharp pencil of a sort of chalk, every part of the picture that is to be of one color. Suppose he wants to make a picture of a girl with brown hair and eyes, red cheeks and lips, and blue dress. He will need at least four stones. On the first he will draw with his pencil, every part that is to be flesh color, face and hands, being careful not to touch a finger to the polished stone, for the least finger mark would injure it. On the second stone he would draw the red lips and cheeks; on the third the brown eyes and hair; and on the fourth the blue dress. The chalk pencil is greasy, you know, and so evereline of the picture is drawn in grease on the four stones. Now comes a man who washes off the stones. The water soaks in everywhere ex-cept where the grease lines areŠwater can't soak into grease. The next man takes a sponge and coolly washes out the chalk lines, so that the stones look entirely clean : but though he washed off the chalk, the grease, which had soaked into the stone, is still there, as firmly as ever. The next man pours gum-water over it, to stop up the pores of the stone. It does this nicely except where the sturdy little grease marks are, and there it can't get in. Now comes the coloring : over the first stone is run a roller covered with flesh-col-ored paint. Oil paint is greasy, of course, so where the gum-water is, the paint won't stick, but on every line of grease it leaves its mark. Over the second stone goes a roller of red paint, leaving a pair of lips and cheeks on the stone. Over the third a brown roller, to color the eyes and hair; and over the fourth a blue roller, for the dress. Now all that needs to be done is to print on the same sheet of paper an impression from each of these stones. The first stone prints in oil paint, a fair complexion and pair of hands; the second a pair of lips; and so on through the whole four. Imagine how careful they must be to have them match each other. If they did not, the girl's eyes might be planted in the middle of her cheeks, in a very unpleasant way ; or her hair an inch or two above her head, as though she'd been scalped by an Indian. Most pictures have many more than four tints. Not only every color, but every shade, has a separate stone. Ordinary pictures have from fifteen to twenty-five stones em-ployed, yet the lines are all soft, and the col-ors shade into each oilier like the original painting. Our best airomos even imitate the threads of the canvas, so that one must look on the wrong side to see if it be oil painting or oil chromo. For those of us who do n't care to look on the wrong side of things they are just as beautiful as the expensive original.ŠLit-tle Corporal. The Shipwrecked Sailor. MANY years ago, in one of the Sabbath-schools in England, there was a boy so wicked and depraved that he was expelled from the school for his bad conduct. He was a source of great grief to his widowed mother. After awhile he went on board a ship and became a sailor, entering into all the vices so common among sailors. During one of his voyages a fearful storm overtook the ship, and on a dark and fearful night it was wrecked. All perished except this wicked young man. Floating along in the darkness, his feet at length touched a rock. He climbed up and found a resting-place. But every returning tide covered this rock several feet with water. In his distress he cried to God, promising to de-vote his life to his service if spared. He re-membered one solitary text of Scripture which he had learned in Sabbath-schoolŠa very singular text, not often quoted, found in Numbers 23: 9. "From the top of the rocks I see him." This text came to him with wonderful force as he sat on the rock, far from land. He prayed God to send a ship to rescue him from a watery tomb.  Confessing his sinfulness, he cried to Jesus to save him. Morning dawned; in its gray light, far in the distance, he discerned a ship, no bigger than a man's hand. As it drew nearer, he made signals, waving his jacket. They res-cued him. Grateful to God for his mercy, he fulfilled his vows. As soon as possible, he returned to that Sabbath-school from which he had been expelled, and told of his wonderful deliverance from deatlf, and of his conversion to God. A thrill of joy went through that school. He became a devout, sincere Christian, and rejoiced in that Re-deemer who did such great things for him. Is it not written, " His way is in the sea, and his path in the great waters, and his footsteps are not known"? Truthfully and beautifully has the poet Cowper written : " God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm." Blessed are they who sow beside all wa-ters. The seed is the word of God. In-corruptible and imperishable, it abideth for-ever. Let every Christian worker implant as much of God's truth in the heart as pos-sibleŠeven where there is obduracy and great wick6dness. Does not the Master say : " Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days "?ŠSel. Faith. DURING the war, there was one house that stood by itself, and the people who lived in it were very much afraid. At the close of one day, the enemy drew near the place ; and as night came on, the darkened sky was lighted up with the glare of fire, almost as red as blood ; and the guns also were heard rolling frightfully. It was win-ter, and the weather was cold and stormy. The good people were afraid of being robbed, but more of being turned out of house and home during the coldest season of the year. The grandmother that lived with them had much comfort and courage too, because she trusted in God. She took up her prayer-book and read to her children and grandchildren a prayer in which were these words, "May God build a strong wall and keep off the enemy from this dwelling." One of the grandchildren who had been listening very attentively, thought it was too much to ask of God to build a wall, and that they ought not to-pray for a thing so impossible. But the grandmother said, It does n't mean to take the words just as they are, but it means, "May God keep us from the enemy as if our house were sur-rounded by a wall !" But if God was really willing to build a wall round our house, do you think it would be impossible with him? Meanwhile, the night passed away with-out a single soldier of the enemy reaching their house. All the family wondered at it. But when they went to the door in the morning, opposite the very spot where the enemy were camping, the snow had drifted up by the wind as high as a wall, so that it was impossible for any one to come through ft. They all thanked and praised God. But the grandmother said, " See, God has indeed built up a wall to keep off the en-emy from our dwelling. Let this be a lesson, never be discouraged or afraid, but ever trust in the Lord, for he has given his an-gels charge concerning thee.' "ŠSel.
