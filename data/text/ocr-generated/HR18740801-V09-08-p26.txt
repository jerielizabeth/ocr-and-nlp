850 THE HEALTH REFORMER. DIETETICS. Food.Å No. 2. ALL living things, be they animal or vegetable, -require nourishment of some kind. It is this which distinguishes most clearly between dead and living matter. The two great classes of ob-jects possessing life, animal and vegetable, do not require the same kind of sustenance. One feeds upon the crude, inorganic materials which abound in the mineral kingdom ; the other can only sub-aist upon the elaborated and refined products of the vegetable kingdom. Thus it is seen that the two classes are complementary ; or, rather, that -the latter class is subservient to the wants of the former. The plant receives into its circulation, through its leaves and roots, such materials as ammonia and carbonic acid. In nature's curious labora-tory, these dead substances are endued with life, being arranged into new forms of organized mat-ter, such as oil, starch, sugar, and gluten. These substances, called proximate principles, are com-bined in various proportions and in a great variety .of modes in the numerous edible substances with which the vegetable kingdom abounds. None of them are ever found existing alone. That is, ,gluten is never found in an uncombined state ; indeed, it is quite difficult to separate it entirely from its connection with other organic substances by any artificial process. Starch and sugar, also, are never produced alone. The various fruits and grains are mostly composed of the four proximate principles mentioned. Thus, wheat, rice, barley, rye, corn, and the other grains, are almost entire-ly composed of starch and gluten, the former ele-ment being largely predominant over the latter. Vegetables usually contain much less solid nutri-ment than grains. Fruits contain much starch, little gluten, and usually a large share of sugar. Nuts contain a larger proportion of vegetable oil than most fruits or grains, besides a large quanti-ty of starch and some gluten. As before mentioned, these substances are called proximate principles, or elements. This name is given to them because they are obtained from the organic substances in which they occur without being subjected to any chemical process which will destroy their vitality and render them inorganic. 'Thus, starch is obtained by simply crushing the kernels of wheat and then washing the bruised mass upon a coarse cloth or seive. The pasty mass remaining after the conclusion of this process is gluten ; while the starch accumulates at the bottom of the vessel containing the liquid which has been employed in washing. Thus, both starch and gluten are obtained nearly pure by the same process. Sugar is obtained by simply evaporating the watery portion of the sweet juices of fruits or plants, or the sap of certain trees, or even some  vegetables. This evaporation may take place with considerable rapidity, at an elevated tem-perature, as in sugar-making, or it may be car-ried on very slowly and at ordinary temperatures, as in the manufacture of raisins. In the latter article it may be usually found in little masses be-neath the skin. It also occurs in dried dates in a similar form. Oil is usually obtained by mechan-ical pressure, by which means it is made to escape from the cells of the vegetable substance contain-ing it. Many seeds are very rich in this product. Some well-meaning hygienists have contended that sugar was an inorganic substance, like sand, pounded glass, etc. ; but this position cannot be sustained by scientific reasoning, and is contrary to well-established scientific facts. One of the most conclusive evidences of this is the fact that it is subject to fermentation, a change which only organic substances are capable of undergoing. The true position of sugar is that of an interme-diate substance between inorganic matter on the one hand, and organized structure on the other. Sugar is formed in the plant for the purposes of growth. According to the statements of our best vegetable physiologists, the saccharine element is elaborated in the leaves, whence it is transported to those parts where growth is taking place, being there organized into cell structure, or woody fiber. It is evident, then, that its relation to the plant is that of prepared food, or partially-organized ma-terial. It is this fact which explains what to many people is wholly inexplicable ; viz., how sugar can be made from saw-dust. The saw-dust was made from sugar in the first place, and the re-formation of sugar from it is only a retrograde process. The same is also true with starch. Sug-ar is sometimes stored up in the plant in the form of starch, into which it has been transformed by the vital activities of plant life. When wanted for use, all that is required is its reconversion into sugar, which is readily effected. The proximate elements which have been men-tioned are composed of primary elements identical with those composing the earth, the air, and water. Their wonderfully different properties, when or-ganized, are supposed to be due to their peculiar arrangement, though how, cannot be explained. Gluten is composed, essentially, of carbon, hy-drogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Starch and sugar are composed of nearly identical proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The oils are usu-ally composed wholly of carbon and hydrogen, containing no oxygen. It will be observed that only the gluten contains nitrogen, while all con-tain carbon. Gluten and all articles resembling it are termed nitrogenous substances ; while sug-ar, starch, and oil, are called carbonaceous com-pounds. Each class supplies a particular want in the system, as we shall show in the next article. In addition to the proximate elements men-tioned, there are certain mineral matters con-
