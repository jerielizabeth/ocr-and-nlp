THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 59 "BLEBS THE LADS." Among the PlantsŠFlowers. NEXT in order to leaves, in the unfolding of the beauties of the plant, are flowers, " the stars of earth." Of graceful forms and delightful fragrance, and rich in brill-iant and delicate colors, they are the glory of the vegetable world. The names given by botanists to the dif-ferent parts of the flower are so often met with that it is well to understand what is meant by them. Let us take the rose to pieces, and examine its beautiful and per-fect construction. The green cup, or calyx, is composed of several leaves called sepals, which enveloped the tiny rose-bud till it burst them apart, and now supports the corolla, or flower. The fragrant rose leaves are the petals that form the corolla. Within the corolla are the little yellow thread-like stamens surrounding the pistil in the center. All these are found in a complete flower. See how perfect is the texture of those petals. The richest velvet looks coarse and common compared with that soft, velvet-like surface. The contrast between man's best work and the beautiful creations of God is very great, the one so very imperfect, the other so faultlessly correct. Long years ago, upon a mountain in Pal-estine, our Saviour, looking probably over the fields stretching out to the view, bright with the brilliant-hued lilies of the East, taught one of the sweetest lessons ever given to mall. He said, " Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow ; they toil not, neither do they spin : and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like, one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, 0 ye of little faith ?" It seems as if God would keep this lesson of trust before us by placing flowers .all around us wherever we go. They smile upon us from our gardens and lawns, look in at our windows, whiten the roadsides, and gem with starry blossoms even the grass. The pond lily sits as queen of the waters ; high up the mountain side or on the edge of the precipice, delicate blossoms remind us that, " He who careth for the flowers will much more care for us." They brighten every season of the year, from the time the early snow-drop lifts its head above the ground in spring, through  all the succession of summer and autumn beauties, to the chrysanthemums and geran-iums that blossom in winter. In France and some other countries are large fields of flowers that are cultivated for manufacturing perfumery. Hundreds of tons of orange flowers, roses, cassia, jas-samine, and violets, are raised yearly for this purpose. When the flower harvest comes, men, women, and children, go out into the fields to gather the fragrant blos-soms. This is pleasant out-door work. How we would like to be out in the flower fields, seeing the lovely sight, and breath-ing the odorous air ! When we see the autumn flowers fading away, it brings to us the thought that we, like them, are frail, and will soon fade away ; they teach us not to love this world too well, or make our plans for life too con-fidently, for our stay here is short. But we look for them again, bright and beauti-ful as ever ; so we hope, when faded and withered here, to bloom anew in Heaven ; and flowers become not only types of our dying, but "Emblems of our own great resurrection, Emblems of the bright and better land." ŠS. S. Advocate. The Fear of Giving Offense. Ł IT is certainly very desirable that Chris-tians should possess pleasant manners, a gen-ial spirit, and all the nameless graces which constitute an attractive deportment. They cannot too assiduously cultivate them, or mourn too deeply the so frequent want of them. Nor can it be denied that, in their efforts to do good, they should avoid giving needless offense. And yet, it seems to me, many persons make this fact a wretched ex-cuse for their indolence or indifference in stimulating others or in bringing the truth to bear upon the minds of men. "Did you try to persuade Mary Green to come to our prayer-meeting? She seems thoughtful, and you have so many opportun-ities of influencing her," says Sarah Brew-erton to Louisa Dunn. " No, I didn't," replied Louisa, " and I do n't intend to do it either; it might give offense, and then I should do more harm than good." And yet this same Louisa did not hesitate, a fortnight before, to offend Jenny White by keeping a piece of music longer than was courteous. "Jenny will be hopping mad with me if I do n't return this music to-day ; but then she'll get over it, and the air is so lovely I must learn it thoroughly before I send it back," were her remarks upon the occasion. " Mr. Steele, did you converse with Mr. Jones about his son, as you intended to do ?" says a friend. "No," replies Mr. Steele, "I concluded, after all, it would be better not to ; it might offend Mr. Jones, and giving offense is no way to recommend the gospel." And yet Mr. Steele had no cgmpunctions about mak-ing a bitter enemy of a neighbor by building a barn in a situation to ruin his prospect and depreciate his property. "A man can't stop bettering his fortunes for every fellow who chooses to take a grudge," was his com-ment. " Oh ! Miss Harcourt I I am so glad to see you," said Edith Gray to a lady somewhat older than herself, but of whom she was very fond. "I want to try my new piano for you. I exchanged my old one for it, and paid a hundred dollars to boot. I have been learning the hymn, Nearer, my God,  to thee.' Would you like to hear me sing it ?" " Very much," replied Miss Harcourt. After conversing a while, Edith went to the piano and commenced singing. When she finished the first verse, Miss Harcourt turned to her in an earnest way, and said : "Do you really want to live nearer to God, Edith ?" "Of course I doŠyes, indeed," replied Edith. She went on with the hymn. Just as she had sung the lines, "Steps up to Heaven, All that thou sendest me, In mercy given," the door opened, and in walked her sister Milly, a child about seven years of age, with a parcel in her hand, through which peeped a blue ribbon. " 0 Milly !" exclaimed Edith, turning quickly round, "you have got my new sash; you naughty girl, why did you touch it ?" " I brought it in for Miss Harcourt to look at," said Milly. " A good excuse," said Edith Ł "but you must n't take my things again, MalyŠnow, remember. It is a lovely shade, Miss Har-court, is it not?" she continued, turning to that lady. "Aunt Fanny sent it to me for the assemblies. It was so kind of her, for I have been out so much this winter, my things are just as shabby as can be." "Are the assemblies very pleasant?" asked Miss Harcourt. "Charming this year," replied Edith. "I am on the go all the time." "Do you find them 'steps up to Heaven' ?" asked Miss Harcourt. " Why, n-o, I can't say I do exactly," re-plied Edith, blushing and looking very much confused. Miss Harcourt saw that her remark had made an impression, and concluded to let it take root without adding anything more. So she rose, saying : " I must really go, Edith ; I have an engagement." When she had taken leave, Edith returned to close the piano. "I suppose Miss Har-court do n't approve of my gay life," she said to herself. Well, it does seem absurd to sing, Nearer to God' and lead the life I do. But parties are so fascinating. I must go to one more at any rate, for Aunt Fanny will be awfully offended if I do n't, after she has sent me a sash and gloves." " Stop now. Choose ye this day whom you will serve," pleaded conscience. After a hard struggle with herself, Edith resolved to amend, and retired to her room to pray for strength to remain firm to her purpose. It was difficult to resist the entreaties of her friends, but she came off victorious. About three months after this, two ladies were walking together from church, when one of them said : " What has come over Edith Gray ? she seems so much more in earnest than she used to be. She has re-sumed her Sunday-school class, and shows great improvement in every way." Now, if Miss Harcourt had been so afraid of giv-ing offense as many seem to be, how differ-ent might have been the result ! In many things we offend all. Let us set a watch at the door of our lips that we offend not in word ; but oh ! do not let us cloak out luke-warmness in the cause of Christ with the specious plea : " We fear to give offense." ŠChristian at Work. TRUTH. WHY should you fear the truth to tell? Does falsehood ever do so well? Can you be satisfied to know There's something wrong to hide below? No; let your fault be what may, To own it is the better way. Ix the Bible, a very nice tale we are told That when a good man was grown very old, Two grandsons were brought very near to his bed, When he prayed unto God for the children, and said, "Bless the lads." Just so let us pray that the God of all grace May lead all our boys to walk in his ways, That they may grow wiser and better each day. Let all who now love them forget not to say, Bless the lads. For our boys are the hope and the joy of our life When they keep out of mischief and quarrel and strife, When they grow up more loving and gentle and true, Then for them we would gladly the good prayer renew, "Bless the lads." May our lads love the Saviour, and through all their days Live only to serve him and show forth his praise ; And then we may hope Jesus will at the last, When weeks, months and years on earth are are all past, "Bless the lads."
