238 OC)r)      GROWTH. BY MARY MARTIN. THE best part of every man's education is that which he gives himself.ŠWalter Scott. I have made as much of myself as could be made out of the stuff.ŠRichter. There are many kinds of growth aside from the vegetable and animal, the varied forms of which awaken a deep and absorb-ing interest in the mind of the student of nature. Every one should possess a knowledge of the laws that govern the physical structure which God has given ; but we are no less "fearfully and wonder-fully made" morally and mentally than bodily, and it is of this formation that we wish to speak more particularly. There are many young people of both sexes who are perfectly satisfied with the position and personal gratification which is theirs by inheritance, without making one individual effort to secure that which lies beyond. There can scarcely be' a more pitiful sight, unless it be the lower forms of vice, than that of a man or woman accustomed to the luxury which wealth affords, when overtaken by a re-verse of fortune. Not more than one out of tenŠperhaps I might safely say a hun-dredŠhave had a course of training in practical life or mental discipline that will enable them to pass the trying ordeal of a financial crisis, and grapple with the stern realities of life successfully. This is because there has been a failure to build on all sides. The cube is not a cube at allŠscarcely a square, for there has been growth only in certain directions. Then there is the " bone and sinew of the world,"Šthe laboring classes,Šwho, we may safely say, rarely take in this subject of growth in its varied and broad-est bearings. How many accept what seems to them the inevitable; and because circumstances are not as favorable as they could wish, consider it useless to aspire to what they cannot attain, and spend all their time and thought upon " What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" Symmetry can only come by uniform development of each part; and unless.  the mind comes in for its share of atten-tion, we have a one-sided character. The prize-fighter may be a fine specimen phys-iologically, but the better part of the man has been neglected until we have a creature so animalized that higher, holier thought shrinks from his companionship. The world has produced representative men and women in the fields of art, science, and literature, whose life-work might have been an inestimable blessing to mankind had not their brilliant achieve-ments been more than counterbalanced by a lamentable deficiency in fine moral distinctions. If the entire effort is con-centrated upon the physical nature, we have simply an animal; if upon the intel-lectual, we find a knave; if the spiritual, a fanatic Ł but let each receive its legitimate share of attention, and a noble man or woman is the result. But how shall this be attained?ŠBy thought, by practice, by unceasing effort. It is not enough to suppress a tendency in one direction, but there should be a corresponding cultivation in another. The weeds are not only to be uprooted, but the good seed must be sown, and the tiny germ protected by.sufflcient warmth and moisture, until the latent life develops, after which much pains-taking will be necessary in supplying conditions, if hope is ever rewarded by flower or fruit. The nineteenth century intellectual par-agon smiles at Pythagoras's theory of transmigration; and yet, who knows that the idea may not be simply a perversion of a self-evident truth, of which we are re-minded by each recurring springtime. The seed which we cover in the moist earth must perish before the new blade emerges ' Ł and as all vegetable growth is preceded by decay, so must it be in the realm of mind as well as matter. The death of the seed or tuber from which the farmer reaps his harvest is emblematical of the process essential to the finest char-acter building. Original tendencies must be broken up, and cultivated habits erad-icated ere the germs of a fairer, nobler growth can thrive in the garden of the heart. The sturdy yeomanry of New England devote their tillage land, not only to the cultivation of corn or wheat, but various cereals, fruits, and vegetables ; while a thousand little things that go to make a home are not neglected. Thus while few amass fortunes, most secure a competence. It remains for ambitious settlers in the new States and territories to lay out ev-ery acre to some one crop, and realize a fortune, or, failing, become disheartened nondescripts. Concentration is one of the most useful attributes, while too great diffusiveness will render "null and void " the creations
