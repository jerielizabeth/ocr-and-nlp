No transaction, 'scapes his eye, Not one sigh, or groan, or tear, Not one idle word passed by, All must be recorded there, Now one kneels before the throne; If his heart is far awayŠ Thus the record is set down, Thus 'twill read at that great day. Swearer pause! that awful name, Just about to leave thy tongue, Will appear in words of flame, When thy soul with fear is wrung. Ye who to the poor deny, Of the plenty to you given, Tremble! for that anguished cry, Is recorded high in Heaven. Though great power may here be gained, To defraud, and cheat, and wrong ; Trample on their fellow's claim,Š Still that pen is moving on. Though the action may in part, Screen the thoughts that move them here, Every motive of the heart In that record will appear. Sinner pause ! ah ! pause with dread Let this question claim your care: When the judgment books are read, Will your name be mentioned there? Solemn warning! Solemn thought! Sinks the heart in deepest gloom ! Mercy then cannot be bought, Fixed for aye, the sinner's doom! C. M. Wimas. Charlotte, Mich. Tobacco Using. No. 7. TOBACCO ON HEALTH. Oun seeming misfortune about this pernicious habit Što which allusion has already been madeŠis, it re-mains so long doing its fatal work without being per-ceived. If its doings could speak out as readily and as loudly as those of alcohol at this day, many a life might be saved that is now being sacrificed upon its cruel altar. The time has been when alcohol did its work unperceived. It walked boldly among men of the first respectability with its arrows of death, without being considered a destroying angel, but rather an angel of mercy, exer-cising good-will to man. Now its cloven foot is seen, and the demon tries to hide himself. He is still doing a fearful work, but not with so bold a face, nor in so reputable a circle. It is somewhat amusing, as well as painful, to see the monster now retire behind a large screen, or in a back apartment of the dram-shops; or down, out of sight, in the basement of respectable hotels; in order that he may carry on his work unblushingly, and that his friends, who would be glad to preserve their re- spectability and their drams, may associate with him with much less embarrassment. But as yet the Devil's great. agent, tobacco, goes shamelessly forth, without the external signs of blood upon his skirts. Not because no blood is there ; nay, his garments are full of the blood of his victims ; but the world has thrown over him the long red vail of fashion, which shields his real character and the marks of his doings. But my prayer before Heaven is, that the vail that covers the sins of this incorrigible mon-ster may soon be torn asunder. It seems to me, that time is not far ahead; that a revolution will soon take place; that men of common sense, of thought and re-flection, will wake up and concentrate the forces of public opinion, to dispel the darkness that hovers over this enormous evil, and wipe its foul stain from the face of human society. A few men are disseminating light upon the subject. It is to be hoped others will enlist their powers in this warfare. Every medical man is called upon, for the highest good of humanity, to which the profession dedi-cates itself, to carry alamp in his hand that will shed light upon the subject. Every minister of the Gospel ought to "cry aloud and spare not," against an evil habit that not only destroys the bodies of those who are required to present themselves living sacrifices upon the altar of Christ, but in benumbing the highest susceptibilities of their souls; an evil habit which, like alcohol, stands in the way of those whom they would persuade to become reconciled to God; an evil habit that is costing the members of the church not only a large amount of their physical and moral energies, but an enormous amount of money, which, in the Christian treasury, would do immense good to a benighted world. There never has been a time since tobacco came into popular use, when men, possessed of a spirtt of hu-manity or of Christian zeal, were so loudly called up-on to come to the help of God and the rescue of the race in this matter, as at the present time. Americans are using it more extensively than any other people. It is estimated that the consumption of tobacco in this country is eight times as great as in France, and three times as great as in England, in proportion to the population. The habit is increasing. There is a larger number, in proportion to the population, who are using it now, than at any former period. It is being used earlier in life than formerly. Our fathers began to use it later in life than the present generation of men. Now it is used very early. Young boys are chewing and smo-king. It often seems to me that if laying my own life on the altar of humanity could save this rising genera-tion, and those that may follow them, from this,  dread-ful destroyer, the offering should freely be made. To see the boys in our streets crippling their vital energies in the very buddings of life, with this Bohun IJpas, is truly appalling. This is the time, if ever, to lay in a good stock of health and soundness. If the vital forces are crippled now, they are probably crippled for life. Its withering influence at this pe-riod, on the brain and nerves, and the electrical currents that flow constantly through them, and on the serous and mucous membranes which gather this electrical fluid, is far greater than at any other age. At this period especially, are needed all the avails of the ner-vious energies, for accomplishing the full and perfect developments of the different organs of the body ; and for ushering in the completions of manhood. But per-haps a more fearful view of the matter still, is its de-structive power transmitted from parent to child. (To be continued.) "sŁ Ł  Picture of a Fallen Church. WE present the reader this week, with some further extracts from the sermon of E. Bowen, D. D., Episcopal Methodist, from which we gave an extract in Review No. 6, present volume. Nothing but the most marked and alarming apostasy from the spirit and power of primitive religion on the part of the Methodist church, could call forth such rebukes from the lips of one of its friends. With respect to intemperance, we may not have kept pace with the English Wesleyan connection, whom a correspondent of the Christian Advocate and Journal represents as a community of incipient drunkards. They, being a little older than we, might be expected to have got a little ahead of us in their devotion to Bacchus. But, however we may have fallen behind them in the use of wines, beers, and other intoxicating liquors as a beverage, still, in that nastier form of intemperance which consists in chewing, smoking, and snuffing tobacco, we can scarcely be out-done. With many among us, the use of this poisonous weed has become an inveterate habit., defying all remedy ; their appetite, by long and unrestrained indulgence, having gained the complete mastery over them. In vain are they expostulated with on the subject by relatives and friends, and by " their superiors in office," whose godly judgments they have solemnly pledged them-selves to "follow;" all sense of the indecency of the practice, and of its offensiveness to all decent people, having become extinct. Still they continue to bow at the shrine of their Bacchanalian idol, and pay him their eager, filthy, slobbering devotions. The ap-palling criminality of a practice which has wasted more lives, not to say more time and money, than any other species of intemperance ; and of insulting every-body they approach, by compelling them to stand aloof with seeming incivility, or inhale the stinking, pestiferous atmosphere they carry about them, gives them no concern. They even regard their guilty in-dulgence as an accomplishment, without which they would scarcely be qualified for respectable society ; and scoff at the vulgarity and superstition of those who presume to make it a question of morals. None except some poor, old asthmatic, under the delusive notion of the medicinal virtues of tobacco, could be seen using it in the early days of our church without. a blush ; but nowŠthe Lord have mercy upon usŠthere are many belonging to the church; of preachers not a few; who can set aside the teachings of physiology, morality, and religion, upon the subject, with a sarcastic sneer; look with an air of self-complacency upon their offensive tobacco-using habits, and " glory in their shame." But the strongest and m ist lamentable evidence of our defection from God is, that having lost the life and power of religion ourselves, we now persecute it, in others. It is by this work of hell, more than any-thing else, that we become identified with fallen churches; for these alone assume the prerogative, 42J
