HOME GYMNASIUM. 235 with little muscular effort. It is thus not necessary for the muscles to be in constant play to keep the body balanced. This is a great disadvantage, since the muscles which hold the body erect, balancing the chest and shoulders upon the pelvis, by the same effort and at the same time perform a most useful office in holding the lives, spleen, stomach, bowels, and other important internal organs in position. Thus when these muscles become weakened through disuse, we have, as the result, a relaxation of the abdominal walls and a prolapse of the abdominal con-tents,Š the spleen, pancreas, liver, stomach, etc. It is thus apparent that there is a great significance in this rigidity of the back Šit always means a weak, relaxed condition of the abdominal muscles ; and this means weakness, disease, nervousness, in fact an endless multitude of maladies. Thus we see that it is of vast importance that the elasticity of the joints and cartilages of the spine should be maintained. This can only be done by proper exercise begun in childhood and continued through life. It is important that the youthful flexibility of all the joints and muscles should be preserved ; and this may be done by constant exercise. The marvelous per-formances of acrobats have given rise to the idea that these men are double-jointed. This is, of course, not true. They have simply preserved the flexibility of their joints by constant training. The acrobat is put in training when he is a small boy. Professional acrobats usually have one or two small boys with them who participate in some of their performances. These small boys are the apprentices of the acrobats. The acrobat begins his professional work at the age of eight or ten ; it is too late if he waits till he is twenty-five or thirty years old. The story is told of Pompey, the famous Roman general, that he had so  maintained the elasticity and strength of his muscles by continuous exercise that he could run, leap, and carry heavy burdens equal to the most robust of his soldiers. Hufeland tells of a remarkable dancer, Galeria Copiola, an Italian woman, who made her first appearance on the stage as a professional dancer at the age of ninety, and who appeared before Augustus in that capacity some years later. Just think of a danseuse one hundred years old ! Another advantage of exercise,Šgeneral, regular, systematic exercise,Šis found in the fact that it coun-teracts the deforming tendency of occupations and bad positions. As the result of the bad position usually assumed in sitting, especially in a rocking-chair, the chest falls in, and posterior curvature of the spine is produced. Half an hour's daily work in a gymnasium will bring back the shoulders, restore the natural curve to the spine, and bring the chest forward and the hips back into a normal, symmet-trical position. The daily use of such exercises will largely counteract the effects of bad positions. A person whose occupation causes a certain set of mus-cles to be constantly employed should take general, systematic gymnastics, to counteract the deforming tendency of his occupation. Every occupation, no matter what it is, and though it may supply an ample opportunity for muscular work, if it re-quires the long-continued use of particular sets of muscles, has a tendency to develop deformity, be-cause the muscles which have been in constant use have become too strong for the rest of the body, and so pull the skeleton into some misshapen position. We must counteract this tendency by the develop-ment of those muscles which are not used in the daily occupation. Spinal curvatures and posterior and lateral curvatures, coming from bad positions, are all curable by proper exercise if begun in time. I SCHOOL ATHLETICS IN RELATION TO MENTAL TRAINING. IF A Ł THE mere circumstance that discussion has long been and still is active in seeking to define the true position of physical exercise in relation to mental training should suffice to prove the essential nature of the connection which binds together these diverse methods of education. Each is in its own place indis-pensable, and this fact happily is in a greater or less degree recognized in every school curriculum, even the most humble. The reason is not difficult to find when we consider how closely and inseparably asso-ciated is the health of the mind with that of the body. It is not in the nature of things that we  should be capable of sustained and vigorous mental activity unless due provision be made for the purifi-cation and nutrition of tissue, including that of the brain, by means of an active blood circulation. The relation between the latter and the muscular energy, requires no explanation. It is true that bodily activ-ity does not confer mental power, or even encourage mental exertion. It is also true that exceptional powers of mind have displayed themselves in persons physically weak ; but neither of these admissions affects our present argument, which maintains the certain advantage resulting to all mental processes,
