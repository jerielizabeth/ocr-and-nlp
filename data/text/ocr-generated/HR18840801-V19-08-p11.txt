&DOD PIMArAT'131. 235 onds after the flash of lightning is seen, and remembering that sound travels at the rate of 1,120 ft. a second, we may cal-culate that the point of the thunder-cloud which gave forth the flash is 2,240 ft. dis-tant. Now, according to the same law as gravitation, sound diminishes in intensity from the center where it originates ; that is, under ordinary conditions, at double the distance it is drily one-fourth as loud, and at three times the distance, it is a ninth. Thus it is if we want to shout to a friend at a distance, in order to condense the vibratory circles we use a speaking-horn, or put our hands together to shout through them. This is fully exemplified in the case of long speaking-tubes used in offices and large buildings, by which means we can speak to a person in a distant room or part of the building. The vast utility of the speaking-trumpet and the ear-trumpet may be readily gathered from the consid-eration that the sounds are reflected from the sides of the tubes, and, in the case of the ear trumpet, are brought to a focus at the end which enters the ear. A striking example, showing that iron, for instance, a batter conductor of sound than air, may be seen if the ear be placed to one end of a long iron tube, and a sound be transmitted through it from the other end, when a double sound is produced, for the reason that the iron conveys the sound more readily than the air, and the second sound (namely, that conveyed by air) takes more time to travel. When we speak of a solid vibrating, it must be remembered that such actually takes place, otherwise the air would not be affected. For instance, the metal com-posing a bell is solid ; but it is a fact that every time it is struck, it really changes its form, and the particles composing it are thrown into motion. And this may be the more readily understood when we re-member that no two particles of matter are in actual contact, for there are minute spaces existing between all those combi-nations of matter which are parts of the universe, as we know it ; and this, too, in the case of such substances as ivory and granite, the component parts of each in re-ality are in a state of separation, and are, moreover, in constant motion. Thus it is that as the bell vibrates, the air to a cer-tain distance round it is compressed at each vibration. The air then expands again, and, in so doing, repeats the pressure on the air next in contact with it, and so on ; and as these concentric circles increase in number, their force is diminished, and the  sound gradually dies away. In the case, then, of a bell's being struck, these vibra-tions of air are produced as just shown; and this air, reaching the ear in an agi-tated state, acts with similar effect upon the drum, and the mind thereupon re-ceives the impression of sound. It has been often noticed that previous to a thunder-storm the air appears to be unusually quiet; and this may be accounted for from the fact that the air is suddenly and very greatly rarified, and, as before remarked, the denser the air the louder the sound, so under these altered condi-tions the power of the air to produce sound is greatly diminished.ŠHealth. WHICH ARE THE HEATHEN? THE esteemed and honored Mrs. B., re-cently a missionary in China, tells of a significant incident, which occurred while she was laboring among the " benighted " Celestials. One day, while she was hold-ing her class of native women, one of them picked up a copy of Harper's Bazaar, which lay upon the table, and looked long and intently upon the deformed women pictured on its pages. At last, she spoke with flashing eyes, and, point-ing to the attenuated waists of the " model figures," said, " LifeŠsqueeze---wicked." Then, dropping the paper, she seized her own substantial waist, and said, " Life here Šheathen woman no squeeze. YOu say we heathen Šwe squeeze feet. No lifeŠfeet. No wickedŠsqueeze feet. But life here "Špressing her bosom reverently, " Christian woman squeeze God's life." Mrs. B. was obliged to admit that the " Christian " women were, indeed, behind their heathen sisters in this respect. ŠIf we consider the amount of ill-tem-per, despondency, and general unhappiness which arises from want of proper diges-tion and assimilation of our food, it seems obviously well worth while to put forth every effort, and undergo any sacrifice, for the purpose of avoiding indigestion, with its resulting bodily ills ; and yet, year after year, from the cradle to the grave, we all go on violating the plainest and simplest laws of health, at the temptation of cooks, caterers, and confectioners, whose share in shortening the average term of human life is probably nearly equal to that of the combined armies and navies of the world.ŠRichardson.
