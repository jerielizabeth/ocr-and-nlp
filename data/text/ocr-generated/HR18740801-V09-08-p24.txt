248 THE HEALTH IEFORMER. TEE "BEST ROOM " THERE was a parlor in the house, a room To make you shudder with its prudish gloom. The furniture stood round with such an air, There seemed an old man's ghost in every chair; Each looked as it had scuttled to its place, And pulled extempore a Sunday face, Too snugly proper for a world of sin, Like boss on whom the minister comes in. The table fronting you with icy stare, Strove to look witless that its legs were bare, While the black sofa, with its horse hair pall, Gloomed like the bier for comfort's funeral. Two pictures graced the wall in grimmest truth, Mister and Mistress W. in their youthŠNew England youth, that seems a sort of pill, Half wish I dared, half Edwards on the Will, Bitter to swallow, and which leaves a trace Of Calvanistic colic on the face. Between them, o'er the mantle, burg in state, Solomon's temple done in copper-plate ; Invention pure, but meant, we may presume, To give some scripture sanction to the room. Facing this last, two samplers you might see, Each with its urn and stiffly weeping free, Devoted to some memory long ago More faded than their lines of worsted woe; Cut paper decked the frames against the flies, Tho' none e'er dared an entrance who were wise, And bushed asparagus, in fading green, Added its shiver to the Franklin clean. When first arrived, I chilled a half hour there, Nor dared deflower with use a single chair ; I caught no cold, yet flying pains could find For weeks in meŠa rheumatism of mind. Š0. W. Holmes. Rude Treatment of Children. BOYS and girls ought not to be brought up too tenderly. It is no hardship, but a life-long blessing to a child, to be obliged to rise early, and to take hold of work as a part of the house-holdŠwork that brings a steady responsibility upon him. It may seem hard to one over-in-dulgent to send boys out on cold winter morn-ings to do chores in the barn, to gather frosty chips, to chop and split wood, or to perform any of the hundred things which belong to the family life. But contempt of petty suffering, regular work, pride of being able to help one's self, fidelity and perseverance under difficulties Šthese are lessons far more important than any that can be learned in books or schools. Many a man has been hindered all his life long be-cause he never learned self-reliance and industry in childhood. So, then, putting children to work early and with a wise adaptation to their years, is not a hardship, but a benefaction. But there are practices which ought to be suppressed as refined cruelties. I mean all those petty punishments which are inflicted on children's heads. I have seen teachers, when boys were whispering, steal up and bump their heads together severely. It is very common to jerk children by the hair off from their feet, and it is not uncommon for parents to pull a  lock of hair pretty severely as a small punish-ment for some misdemeanor. No punishment of any kind ought to be in-flicted upon the head of any of the Caucasian stock. It may be handy, but it is demoralizing. It rouses the temper and every evil feeling in a child. Cuffing the ears, snapping the head, es-pecially with a thimble-armed finger, are al-ways demoralizing, If children have any grace, it all flies under such discipline. They burn with anger, they are stung with shame, they inwardly curse their tormentor, and we have known many a boy come forth from such misjudged parental hand-ling livid with rage, and as soon as he was out of hearing, pour forth a torrent of oaths and blackguardism that well might make one shudder. The head is the center of all sensibility. Slapping the mouth, pulling the hair, rapping the scalp, or pinching the ears, are good meas-ures for the development of depravity ; but if designed as restraining or reformatory punish-ment, they are utterly bad and provocative of-tentimes of as many evils as they seek to cure. When children have done wrong and when cor-rection is needed, it ought not to be ignomin-ious. No man or child is ever made to love right conduct by being brutally treated, or by offending, at the same time, both his sense of justice and his proper pride of character. But there is a nursery view of a child's suffer-ings not quite so important, but which I feel impelled to protest against. I mean the unman-nerly and inhuman way of washing and comb-ing. Oh, Mr. Bonner, what a sad reminiscence of life does that subject open ! Does not my face even yet tingle, as I recall the rude scrub-ings which it used to suffer ! A great, round, rosy face, with eyes so prominent that soapsuds could hardly fail to soak into them, and with a skin that seemed to show the slightest streak or spotŠhow was it rubbed round and round by the elder sister's hand, as if it made no dif-ference whether it was rubbed up or down ! To her it did not. To me it was a matter of un-speakable importance. Then, to comb one's hair as one would hetchel flaxŠis that to be tol-erated in a civilized community 4 In behalf of ten thousand boys and girls, and in memory of untold grievances of this kind, I beg of you to protest against such inquisitorial ways with little folks, who have not yet learned how to bear little pains.ŠH.
