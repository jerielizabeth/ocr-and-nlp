TRAINING SCHOOL. 245 which water is projected in the form of a spray with such force as to disguise the sensation of cold by the active stimulation of the skin. The uses of the douche and spray are many. They are a valuable measure for irrigating and cleans-ing all wounds, abscesses, burns, etc. The water may contain any disinfectant prescribed. When employed to arrest hemorrhage, it should be 120° to 530° in temperature, and may hold in solution alum, tannin, or other astringents. This treatment may be used to stimulate torpid internal organs, as the liver, stomach, and bowels. Alternate volumes of hot and cold water should be allowed to play for five or tin min-utes daily over the organ to be treated. The treat-ment is also very useful in relieving chronic stiffness and soreness of the joints arising from rheumatism, sprains, and other injuries. In case of varicose veins, muscular weakness, and feeble circulation, it is a useful tonic measure, improving nutrition and in-creasing the blood supply, and thus assisting greatly in warming habitually cold extremities. The spine may often be greatly relieved by a cool douche or spray, and a swollen, inflamed joint may be reduced by heat used in the same way. A very fine hot spray  given with a little force is very soothing in inflamma-tion of the eyes. A coarser spray, given with greater force and medicated with soda, is useful in acne and other eruptive diseases of the face. The ordin-ary fountain syringe will answer in these cases by using the spray funnel which comes with the other apparatus. The treatment may be given on an oilcloth cot when the patient is too weak to sit or stand. The douche or spray is very beneficial in reducing the temperature in all fevers, in relieving hypostatic congestion of the spine, in preventing bed sores, and in all cases where, from weakness, wasting, and long-continued pressure, the tissues over the bony projec-tion of the spine are in danger of dying. The internal douche to relieve constipation, diarrhoea, pain, etc., and to cleanse and disinfect mucous surfaces, is a very important remedial appliance of modern times. The douche and spray .are also useful for rinsing the the body after a soap and water shampoo, and also as a cooling bath after a pack, vapor, Turkish, Rus-sian, or other hot bath, the cool water and force of the flow toning up the skin, and preventing the patient from taking cold or feeling exhausted afterward. THE SICK ROOM. IN planning dwelling houses, the builder, the archi-tect, and the householder plan for all kind of rooms, useful and ornamental. Thus we find kitchens, din-ing-rooms, bedrooms, living rooms and other useful rooms, as well as dark, unused parlors, spare bed-rooms, conservatories, and other more unnecessary rooms. Yet even in costly homes no provision is made for the sickness sure sooner or later to visit every family. So when sickness does come, there is no place where the sufferer may find suitable rest, and separation from the necessary noise and bustle of the working part of the household, or if the dis-ease be infectious, others in the house be protected from it. It must be the want of a precedent in house architecture that such a room is not planned for in every house of even moderate dimensions. To make a model sick room requires no extravagant outlay for costly furniture, carpets, or drapery. It needs no frescoing or expensive finish of either woodwork or walls, but simply a hard finished or painted wall and ceiling of some neutral tint, Š light drab, brown, or stone color,Š and painted or oil finished wood-work made as plain as possible, so as to furnish no place for dust to lodge. The exposure .s best either to the southeast or the west. The room should have two or three windows and an outside door, the latter being very important in case of contagious disease. A grate or an open stove is very useful as a means of ventilation, and also for destroying infected material. The site of every house is all important, and should be high and dry. The ventilation should be as perfect as possi-ble. The ideal of perfection in this respect would be attained by having the air from the sick room, especially if the disease is contagious, made to pass through a hot air shaft or over heated cylinders of a temperature above 3oo°, so as to destroy all living organisms, thus completely sterilizing the air. The furniture of the room should be as plain as possible,Š an iron bedstead, single width, with woven wire springs and an air, hair, excelsior, orŁhusk mat-tress, and other furniture free from upholstery. There should be two or three chairs, a woven wire cot, a table, a bedside stand, and a commode with drawers. The bedding should be blankets, those which have been worn, if they are not shrunk, and old sheets being better than new ones, as they are
