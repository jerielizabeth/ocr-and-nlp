AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 479 The Maine Camp-Ground. THE Maine camp-meeting this year will be held in Deering, a pleasant town adjoining Portland. The grounds secured form a part of a tract of land known as "Deering's Oaks," and lie just far enough from the city to be free from its dust, noise, and confusion. The scenery of the surrounding region is noted for its pict-uresque beauty. The calm, clear waters of Casco Bay partially embrace the land and send cooling sea-breezes over the country. The spires and pinnacles of the Forest City rise from the hill just across the inlet, and when bathed in the golden light of the sun, present a rare scene for the pen of an artist. Far away may be seen dense old forests in all their primeval loveliness, inviting the beholder to " list to Nature's teachings," while the breezes seem to whisper:Š " There Nature's temple open stands; There's none so nobly grand as hers, The sky its roof, its floor all lands, While rocks and trees are worshipers." The portion of land selected for the encamp-ment proper is surrounded by a high board fence, which will enable the "dwellers in tents" to close their gates against the outside world at night, and reminds one of the ancient sheep-folds and of the "one fold," and the "one door," "by which if any man enter he shall go in and out and find pasture." Within the enclosure are a few of the venerable oaks which have given the place notoriety. Longfellow refers to this grove in the following beautiful words:Š " And Deering's woods are fresh and fair, And with joy that is almost pain My heart goes back to wander there, And among the dreams of the days that were I find my lost youth again." It is hoped that at the coming camp-meeting many a soul will find in a Saviour's love its lost peace, and with a joy unspeakable catch glimpses of the bloom, glow, and freshness of eternal youth, beauty, and life. Elam. H. MORTON. Report of Chicago Branch, International T. and M. Society. THERE are twelve persons now connected with the Chicago Mission, eight or ten of whom are  sold on the vessels. The result of this work is, that one who embraced the truth of late re-ceived the light in that way. The colporters are full of courage. Many families are opening their doors to them and listening to the precious truth as it is presented by these humble servants of God. Good angels are with them, and we expect good results in this city will follow in the near future. JAMES SAWYER. Reno, Nevada. Oua tent-meetings still continue with a good degree of interest. We have presented the leading points of present truth. and several have decided to obey, but just how many we cannot now tell.' The people seem to -rnotze slowly, but we believe they will prove faithful and true to God. It is difficult to sell books, be-cause money matters aro very close here this season. This is a central point for our work in this State, and we hope by the blessing of God to see the truth established here so that the light will soon shine to every part of the State. We believe' the coming camp-meeting will help the work here greatly, and we hope that all friends of the cause will avail themselves of the privi-leges of this meeting. There is much to be done for Nevada, and there are many honest souls here. What is needed is earnest, faithful effort to search them out. Brethren and sisters, pray for us. G. D.

JEssEN.ŠDied, at Crystal Springs, Cal., July 23, 1.884, Bro. Thomas Jessen, aged 46 years and 2 months: Brother Jessen had been ailing for about four years, but was confined to his bed-  only four days before his death. The immediate cause of his death was an abscess in the throat. Brother Jessen was a native of Denmark, and, excepting one brother, has no kindred in America. The two brothers em-braced present truth in 1874, in Oakland, Cal. The other brother is still faithful. Thomas died in the faith, and, we trust, sleeps in Jesus. H. A. ST. JOHN. WADDELLŠDied, In Portland, Oregon, July 29, of consumption. Mrs. Jessie F. Waddell, daughter of Dr. I. F. and S. F. Roberts, aged 22 years and 7 months. CLEMENTS.ŠDied, in Merrimack, N. H., July 10, 1884. Addie E., daughter of John H. and Mary A. Clements, aged 13 years, 5 months, and‚20 days. Addie was a faithful and obedient child, and pos-sessed an intelligent mind beyond her years in regard to present truth. She was fond of reading her Bible, and loved family worship. The Sabbath-school was also a delight, and in our social meetings she always bore her testimony. Her influence over her young associates was good, as she was constantly pointing them to the Lamb of God. About the last act before going to Baboosick Pond to bathe, where she met her death by drowning, was to take the Bible and engage in secret prayer. The hope of being saved in the kingdom was exceedingly pre-cious to her young mina. A father, mother, one brother, and three sisters mourn her loss, and miss her from the family circle, but they have &bright hope of meeting her in the resurrection morning. The funeral services were conducted by the elder of the Amherst church, and a few words of comfort were spoken by Sr. M. E. Haskell, of South Lancas-JoIEW IfŁ CLEMENTS, THE SABBATH QUESTION.

Address, SIGNS OF THE TIMES, Oakland, c,t; session of Sab- daily visiting from house to house, taking sub-scriptions and holding Bible-readings. The effort and principal desire on the part of the Mission is to follow up any interest that ap-pears, and get subscriptions to our periodicals as fast as possible. The result has been twenty yearly subscrip-tions for the SIGNS OF THE TIMES; 150 SIGNS subscribersŠfor three months, and six weeks; eighty-nine yearly for Harold and Tidende; forty trial three months for the same; twenty. five subscribers for Good Health, seven for Ger-man paper, and three for Youth's Instructor. Thirty copies of " Thoughts on Daniel and Rev-elation " delivered. Three copies of this work have also been loaned with good results. Sev-eral hundred orders for the Swedish Hand-Books have been taken, and over 200 filled. About 150 orders taken for the " Sunshine at Home." Of late four have embraced all the truthŠthree heads of families; two were Americans and two Scandinavians. Two who embraced the truth in an earlier part of our mission are still faithful. This makes six, the result of this mission, who are firm. The families of three of these parties are favorable, as their children have joined our Sabbath-school. The membership of our last bath-school was 45. The Sunday-school is helping us. Last Sun-day's membership was about 35. The work agtong the emigrants and seamen keeps one constantly visiting the boats and depots, so as to supply them with reading mat-ter. Many of the publications are now being ter, Mass.
