August 6, 1899. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 191  617 unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3: 16, 17. The same apostle says, "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learn-ing, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope." Rom. 15:4. See also 1 Cor. 9:9; 10. He also charged Timothy, "by the coming of the Lord," to "preach the word." The Old Testament is tlie word of the Lord, indicted by the "Spirit of Christ," which was in the writers. See 1 Peter 1 : 10-12. From these scriptures, and many others, it is clear that the dispen-sation of the Old Testament has not been superseded. "The word of the Lord endureth forever." The fulfilling of .a law always means the carrying out of its provisions, not the de-struction or annulment of the law. Christ did fulfill the law in every particular; but, so far from superseding it,the record says- he "mag-nified" it, and "made it honorable." That was just what the world had not been doing. The world had been disregarding the law of God. That was what constituted it a sinful world, for "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3 :4). , "Where no law is, there is no transgression" (Rom. 4 : 15). Jesus Christ was the first man who had perfectly fulfilled, or obeyed, the law. Shall we conclude that the law was to continue until one man could be found to fully obey, and then be set aside? That is the logic of the "indUction". quoted in this article: That this was not the design of the Lord, we have proof in the eighth chapter of Romans. The law points out duty, but Of itself it cannot help sinful men (men of "carnal mind," verse 7) to be obedient. Therefore "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh [which is sin-ful], God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for-sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousnes of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the the flesh, but after the Spirit." Mr. Jones' conclusions evidently overreach his design, for they logically indicate that the work of the gospel minister is superfluous. As "sin is the transgression of the law," and "sin is not imputed .where there is no law," what is the logical conclusion if the law be annulled? Are we note shut up to the con-elusion that there is no sin? And if.there be no sin, what Ł need of pardon ? what need of a Redeemer? . what need of a preacher? To-fulfill a law of the State is always un-derstood to be the fulfilling of its require-ments::.  No man supposes, when he pays his taxes in fulfillment of the demands of the law, that the law is thereby superseded. If lie should so suppose, he would find himself much mistaken when the time came round for pa.ynient again. Nor is it deemed neces-sary in such dim that the law be reenacted from year to year. If the logic of the "in-duction" herein before quoted be correct, then the fulfillment of a law of the Brit-ish Government (to which the Australian colonies are subject), would mean its repeal, hence the necessity of reenactment after every fulfillment. But the provinces of that coun-try do not so reason. For instance, they are still enforcing an old and tyrannical Sunday law, declared and vigorously enforced in the reign of Charles II., and condemning men to the stocks for working on Sunday. And the men who contend that the law of God was annulled by its fulfillment, do not claim that this old British Sunday law is not legitimately in force. From the utterly illogical reasoning of Mr. Jones it is clear that he has no ground what-ever for his assumption that the apostles "practically effected the transfer [of the Sab-bath] from the seventh to the first day of the week." Inasmuch as the Scriptures are si-lent upon the subject of such a transfer, we are certainly warranted in demanding better evidence than is presented in this argument of the Australian. preacher. As to his proposition that "it is the will of Christ that the Jewish Sabbath as such be no longer binding," we have only to say that the weekly Sabbath never was "a Jewish Sabbath as such." It was promulgated in Eden, and always was, and is, the Sabbath of the Lord, designated by himself as "my holy day," "the holy of the Lord." Isa. 58:13. "The Sabbath was made for man," not merely for the Jews, and "the Son of Man [not the Jews] is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2: 27, 28. This statement was made when the first- day sabbath tradition had not been heard of. Whether, upon such illogical assumptions as are set forth by Mr. Jones, it is wisdom to "conclude that the first day of the week is divinely authorized," we leave the reader to judge for himself. If, however, it come to us "in lieu of. the Jewish Sabbath"Šan institu-tion entirely of the imagination,- nowhere mentioned in the word of GodŠthen the .assumed divine authorization of the first-day sabbath must itself be imaginary. SIN. Six always causes loss. It is never profit-able. It is the highwayman that stands be-side the path and robs you of. whateVer of value you may possess. It is the sly thief that-intercepts that which was intended for you, so that you do not receive it. It is both a thief and a robber. Sin . well understands this art. It does not take the whole at first, but, like the dishonest clerk, it begins by tak-ing a little here and a little there, and so very often carries on its dishonest dealing a long time before it is detected. The Christian is not, led to commit some great sin first of all; the enemy is too crafty for that. It is by littles that the soul is led astray. A little sin isr presented at first. But that forms the beginning. It is the starting of the train, on the down grade, to gather speed and momentum as it goes on. That sin has to some extent robbed the soul of the conscious help. and joy of God. It has benumbed the spiritual sensibilities; it has perverted the judgment and the .sense of right. Hence the soul is not in the condi-tion to discriminate between right and wrong that it was before. Because of this, the second sin becomes easier.  than the first, and the third easier than the second. And the further you proceed, the easier sin becomes, because -of this los4 of sensibility and the power of discrimination. And this means that the soul has been-gradually growing un-susceptible to the voice and the touch of God. This explains the indifference and worldli-ness on the part of me-mberS_ Of-churches;  and their forgetfulness of their covenant obliga-tions. Put it down as a fact always to be remem-bered, sin is a robber. And that which is a robber in time becomes the source of -ruin in eternity. Let us turn away from sin, know-ing that a holy, godly life is always pleasing unto GodŠMessiah's Herald. sforne and 3-fealth.

SUMMER IN THE CEMETERY. BY NETTIE J. HUNT. SHE softly folds her-glowing robes upon thein,. Those dear, bare mounds that hold the heartg we miss, And brightens them with violets blue, and wakens The tender fern with many a lover's kiss. She bids the robin and the bluebird loiter, And trill their sweetest in the cypress trees. They know no death tale, so their glorious piping Fills with its melody the scented breeze. And then she presses loving lips upon them, Those mounds so bright with blue and gold and green. "0 dust that lies beneath this matchless splendor, Knowest thou never fairer robes were seen? "Into thy darkened eyes does not the sunrise Gleam in its rose-hued marvel ever new? Into thy sleeping ears do not the bird songs Steal with their tales of love forever true?" But to her loving passion comes no answer; So, with a flood of tender, gushing tears, Leaves she white lilies, golden hearted, fragrant, Whispers, "Sleep on till God's great spring appears."

She had to stop; her eyes ran over on her pale cheeks, and she clasped her thin hands together in a convulsive effort of self-control. .D.K;;Sirong; a white-haired old man, with the,ge ntlest faCe and kindest manner.- possible;  I ooked d tressed; he could not say anything, for he had no clue to these sobs and tears. Mrs. Dyer had been a member of his church when he lived at Blan ford ; he remembered her a bright, delicate young girl, the only daugh-ter of a well-to-do farther. She was fairly well educated, had made a profession of reli-gion in early youth, had married at twenty a young lawyer already in good practice, fOr he was ten years older than she, and had be-sides a little inherited property. Dr. Strong had heard of her from time to time, and some-times met her when she came home on a visit. He knew that she was temporarily prospermis, and that she had three children; and at lait he himself was called to a church in the city where she lived, and learned then for the first time that she was recently widowed. She had written a note to him, asking that he would come to see her; and, in answer to her request, he was with her now. Poor little' thing! She was a pathetic spectacle to lier old paiitor as she sat there struggling with her tears, thin, pallid, and sad, with a com-fortless sorrow, as he could plainly see, for neither hope nor submission lent a gleam to her eye or calmed her forlorn countenance. This was not a case of ordinary consolation he felt at once; but, before she could-  control herself, in rushed a rosy boy of ten. "Mother," he shouted, "can I go over to . Denham with Hal Jones?" Mrs. Dyer held out a hand and d'rew him to her side. She stopped her tears, and wits composed at once. "Come here, Harry," she said, in very soy
