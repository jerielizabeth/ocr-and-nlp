44. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. Vol. 1, No. 6'. 5 11.e  .ign  of Mr 'aims OAKLAND, CAL., FIFTH-DAY AUG. 13, 1874. The Present Truth. TWENTY-FIVE years ago the past month we issued the first number of a little paper entitled The Present Truth. On that very month, July 1849, our second son, James Edson White, who has charge of THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES in our absence, was born. As indicated by the title of the sheet we started a quarter of a century ago, we then held, and still hold, that certain great doctrines of the Bible are applicable to our time in an especial sense. The second coining of Christ is the crowning event of the stupendous plan of redemption, and has been a truth of the greatest importance to fallen man since the hope of salvation through Jesus Christ was first opened to the represen-tative of the fallen race. Hence holy Enoch, the seventh from Adam, looking forward to this glorious event as' the consummation of the hope of all the just, prophesied, "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to exe-cute judgment upon all." Jude 14, 15. But the doctrine of the second appearing of Jesus Christ becomes present truth in our day, from the fact that the generation is reached when the event may be scripturally expected, and in which the world is to be warned of its coming doom. We trace the several lines of the prophecy of Daniel over the four monarchies of Babylon, Persia, Grecia and Rome, and they bring us to our time as the grand epoch of utter distruction of all earthly dominions, the estab-lishment of the immortal kingdom, and the eternal reign of the righteous. And if we fol-lOw the several prophetic lines of the book of the Revelation down over the fourth empire, Rome, we are brought to the same conclusion, that the last generation of men.is reached, and that we stand before the naked glare of eternal scenes. And when we consider the signs in the heav-ens above, in the earth beneath, and among the nations, of which Christ spake when a teacher of the people at his first advent, as he pointed forward to his second appearing, we feel the force of his application of the parable of the fig tree when he says, " So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it ≈Åis near, even at the doors." Matt. 24 : 33. The Sabbath of the Bible is as old as the world. It is no more a truth to-day that the Creator rested on the last day of the first week, that he blessed the day of his rest, and that he Set it apart for the sacred observance of man, than when Adam entered upon the second week of time. These facts underlie the Sabbatic in-stitution, which exists in all dispensations, and running into the eternal age, parallel with the existence of the facts. When it ceases to be a fact that Jehovah rested on the last day of the first week of time, that he put his .blessing on that day, and set that day apart for man, then the Sabbath of the Lord will cease. Sabbath signi-fies rest. The seventh day, and no other day of the week, is the Rest [Sabbath] of the Lord, for the reason that the Lord our God rested on the seventh, and on no other day of the week. The prophets of God, Christ and his apostles, honored the Sabbath. The Jews at the time of the first advent of the Son of God supposed the institution theirs alone. But their bigoted narrowness stands rebuked by these emphatic words of our Lord, " The Sabbath was made for man." He identifies himself with the Sab-bath in declaring that " the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath," and thus he hands the creation Sabbath down to the Christian church. The measurement of time by weeks originated with what God did on the first seven days of time. Years are marked by the revolution of the earth around the sun. Scriptural months by the phases of the moon, and days by the revo-lution of the earth upon its axis. But there is nothing on earth, in Heaven, or in the physi-cal or spiritual nature and wants of the race, to mark the measurement of time into sevens of days. This custom, as old as our world, is trac-able only to what God did on the first seven days. Hence the reason for this institution is given in the law which regulates the Sabbath in these words : "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day ; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." The Sabbath, however, becomes present truth to us in the light of those prophetic declara-tions which teach its restoration. " And they that shall be of thee," says the proph-et Isaiah, " shall build the old waste places. Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many  generations. And thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words." Chap. 58 : 12, 13. And when we come down to our time, to the message of the third angel which ripens the har-vest of the earth, just prior to the appearing of the Son of man on the great white cloud, Rev. 14, the declaration, " Here are they that keep the commandments of God," has the ring of present truth in it. If the first message of this chapter is fulfilled in the great second advent movement of the near past and the present, and if the second message applies in a special sense to all corrupted Christianity of our time, then the words " Here are they that keep the com-mandments of God and the faith of Jesus," ap-ply to the Sabbath reform now progressing among those Christians who are looking for the second coming of Christ and the judgment, in a most clear and forcible manner. Most cer-tainly, men in all past time should have kept the commandments of God. They should keep them at the present time. And as certainly as the words " Here are they that keep the com-mandments of God," apply to a particular pe-riod, and especially to our time, the passage does present before us the great Sabbath reform-ation in the sense of present truth. It was as true six thousand years ago, when repenting Adam bowed his head to the decree of death for his transgression, and bedewed his pathway with tears as he in sorrow passed out the gate of Paradise, that immortality is the gift of God, and that the future life depends upon the resurrection of the dead, as it is true to-day. And yet as this doctrine is the only shield against the seductions of modern spiritualism, which ism God permits to take millions of the present generation within its hellish folds, the doctrine of immortality through Christ alone becomes present truth. And now that the great work is fairly begun, and is extending to the nations, and is rapidly in-creasing in strength, it becomes those whose duty it may be to lead out in the general directing and managing the several branches of the work, to act in the fear of God with wisdom. We have spoken freely in the Review of broader plans in the execution of the great work before us. And in the same articles we have suggested that branch offices of publication should be estab-lished on the Atlantic, and on the Pacific. By broader plans we do not mean that capi-tal should be drawn from all parts of the wide field to build up unwieldly institutions at any given point to the neglect of others. We need a good school in Michigan. We need another on the Pacific coast, and another on the Atlan-tic, and still others, one in Western New York, and another between the Mississippi and Mis-souri Rivers. Michigan must soon own her own school located at Battle Creek, by refunding to help build up schools in other localities what she has received from other States. We plead for the Pacific coast. We shall call the attention of the General C onf erence toihe im-portance of school advantages of the right sort in California at the present time. We shall ask that body to sanction a furlough to Bro. T.T. Smith to spend three or four months in that good State. And if the California: Confer-ence can furnish him a class of fifty, he can, be-fore his return, give a full course of Biblical Lec-tures. Our attention has been forcibly called to this subject by the case of two young men in Oakland who have been struggling with poverty, while studying for the ministry. They were about ready to enter the UniverSity at Oakland. We were happy to hear them both speak freely in a public meeting a few days since, at which time they fully committed themselves with us. There are forty-eight others, more or less, on the Pacific who should immediately have a thorough drilling on the fundamental principles of present truth. And no man among us needs a trip to the Pacific more, or can do that kind of work better, than our brother Smith. Broader plans, does not mean to keep a man of Bro. Smith's powers shut up to one office, and to one school, in one little city of seven thousand people. We must have men and women educated on the Pacific, for editors, preachers, and missionary laborers. The Gen-eral Conference will ask the friends in Califor-nia to give Bro. Smith a full class, to care for him while he is in the State, and to send him home with a " God bless you." The Conference will do the rest. Here will be a good chance for the edit-or of the Yolo Democrat to fit for a work vastly  broader and more important than to serve a party in one county. From these suggestions, and more of the like we have to make, the read-er can gain some clue to what we mean by "broader plans." Eastern friends have shown their confidence in the cause of present truth, and also in those who have been connected with it from the first, by their liberal pledges for the establishment of the press on the Pacific coast. But let it be un-derstood, that not one dollar of the money so kindly and liberally offered for this purpose by the devoted friends of the cause east of the Plains, should be sunk in publishing west of the Plains. Let the One Hundred Dollar men east of the Plains furnish the steam press and ma-terials complete, to be kept complete in value ; and then let the friends on the Pacific coast sup-port the SIGNS OF THE TIMES. The End. THE existing state of things will not always last. The end will come. The apostle assures us "that there shall come in the last days scof-fers," who will boastfully inquire, " Where≈Å is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." But the chariot wheels of the Coming One will not be delayed by the skepticism of the religious skeptic, or the scoffing of the religious scoffer. The end will come. Prophetic fulfillments in the past, and the present signs of the times, jus-tifiy the most literal application of these fear-ful words of the prophet to our time. " Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble ; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand." Joel 2 : 1. Another prophet, looking forward to the close of the present state of things, ex-claims : "An evil, an only evil, behold is come. An end is come, The end is come. It watch-eth for thee. Behold it is come." "The time is come. The day draweth near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.". Eze. 7 : 5, 6, 12. The end to an unbelieving world will be ter-rific beyond description. But to the just it will be a day of glory, of release, and reward. With longing eyes and quickly beating hearts they will be looking forward to it. And when it shall come, and their adorable Redeemer shall be seen coming down the blazing vault of Heaven, their glad voices will unite in the triumphant shout, " Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and re-joice in his salvation." Isa. 25 : 9. We give the following paragraphs from the Christian, un-der the caption of the end :≈† " The fleeting nature of this word, and the solemn fact of its approaching end, has occupied the thoughts of God's people for ages past. Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied of a coming Lord and a coming judgment on, all that are ungodly among men. Abraham was content to wander a houseless dweller in tents, in an un-certain world, looking for his permanent inher-itance to the heavenly country, and the city that hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Job foresaw the day when the heavens should be no more, and his Redeemer should appear and stand upon the earth in the latter day. David was a stranger and sojourner here, and foretold the time when the God of glory should appear in flaming fire. Isaiah exclaimed, `,0, that. thou wouldest rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.' Daniel foresaw the dissolu-tion of all the pomp and glory of a sinful world, and heard the solemn word, At the time ap-pointed, the end shall be.' " Malachi predicted the coming of the day that shall burn as an oven,' when all the proud, and they that do wickedly, shall be given to the flames. Jesus foretold the time when the wicked, like the tares among the wheat, shall be gathered in bundles and burned, in the end of the age. Paul declares, Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.' John on Patmos exclaims, Even so come, Lord Jesus ! ' James exhorts the saints to be patient, because the day of their deliver-ance draweth nigh. And Peter says, " the end of all things is at hand." " Living, then, in a fleeting and uncertain world, we,axe to pass the time of our sojourn-ing in fear.' All things which we covet, love, and long for, shall soon pass forever from our grasp, and every earthly joy on which our hearts and hopes repose, shall glide away like a forgot-ten dream. We must learn hence to hold this world with a loosened grasp, and to let no idol-atrous love of earthly things becloud our spirit- ual vision and keep back our hearts from purer and more enduring joys. " The Christian's hope is anchored within the vail. Not here, but hereafter, will his desire be realized, his aspirations satisfied. He has some-thing in view better than earth's ideals, some-thing that eye hath not seen nor ear heard, only as God hath revealed it by the Holy Spirit and. in his living word. He has no lack of hope, joy, and consolation, but it reaches beyond the toss of earthly storms and the surge of earthly billows. The end of all things is at hand,' but he shall not be a loser by the change. His treasures are in Heaven. His heart is there also ; and in due time he shall rest from his labors and reap his great reward. 'Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,' what are the trifles of earth, the pomps, the pleasures, and the pride of a departing world, compared with the eternal gladness that is waiting for him, the eternal glory that he so soon shall share ? "But let not the vain and godless take cour-age at judgment's long delay. Let not the scof- fer exult in sinfulness and pride. The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; ' the heavens being on fire, shall be dissolved ; the elements will melt, and the works of man shall perish in the dissolving flames ; and only for the saints of God shall home or hope remain, in that New Heaven and New Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.' "Let us make their blessed portion our own. Let us resolutely spurn the enticements of a sin-ful world. Let us take heed, lest like Esau, for one morsel of meat ' we sell our priceless birthright. Let us watch, and wait, and hope, and work ; and with the passing months and fleeting years, the changes, chances, convulsions, and tumults that rack the world, let us hear for-ever these words of solemn omen and of joyful cheer, The end of all things is at hand ; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.' " The Temptation of Christ. RY MRS. E. G. WHITE. SATAN comes to man with his temptations as an angel of light, as he came to Christ. He has been working to bring man into a condition of physical and moral weakness, that he may over-come him with his temptations, and then tri-umph over his ruin. And he has been success-ful in tempting man to indulge appetite, re-gardless of the result. He well knows that it is impossible for man to discharge his obligations to God, and to his fellow men, while he impairs the faculties God has given him. The brain is the capital of the body. If the perceptive fac-ulties become benumbed through intemperance of any kind, eternal things are not discerned. God gives no permission to man to violate the laws of his being. But man through yielding to Satan's temptations to indulge intemperance, brings the higher faculties in subjection to the animal appetites and passions. When these gain the ascendency, man, who was created a little lower than the angels, with faculties susceptible of the highest cultivation, surrenders to be con-trolled by Satan. And he gains easy access to those who are in bondage to appetite. Through intemperance, some sacrifice one half, and others two thirds, of their physical, mental, and moral powers, and become playthings for the enemy. Those who would have clear minds to discern Satan's devices, must have their physical appe-tites under the control of reason and conscience. The moral and vigorous action of the higher powers of the mind are essential to the perfec-tion of Christian character. And the strength or the weakness of the mind has very much to do with our usefulness in this world, and with our final salvation. The ignorance that has prevailed in regard to God's law in our physi-cal nature is deplorable. Intemperance of any kind is a violation of the laws of our being. Im-becility is prevailing to a fearful extent. Sin is made attractive by the covering of light which Satan throws over it, and he is well pleased when he can hold the Christian world in their daily habits under the tyranny of custom, like the heathen, and allow appetite to govern them. If men and women of intelligence have their moral powers benumbed through intemperance of any kind, they are, in many of their habits, elevated but little above the heathen. Satan is constantly drawing the people from saving light, to custom and fashion, irrespective of physical, mental, and moral health. The great enemy knows tha* if appetite and passion predominate, that health of body and strength of intellect are sacrificed upon the altar of self-gratification, and man is brought to speedy ruin. If enlightened intellect holds the reins, controlling the animal propensities, keeping them in subjection to the
