23$ THE HEALTH REFORMER. freedom of movement which it permits. With the hope that sensible women in the country, who groan under the grievous yoke custom and fashion have hitherto imposed upon them, may see their way clear to a more healthful and en-joyable style of dress, we have been thus mi-nute and specific in what we have said." Surely, this is a move in the right direction. This mode of dress in many respects is an ex-cellent one, and does away entirely with that useless, health-destroying corset, and obviates the necessity of suspending the clothing wholly from the waist, and furnishes protection for the feet, but does not so fully for the limbs. Near-ly all health institutions have adopted a style of dress which secures to the wearer those things so essential to a healthful style of dress. The reader will notice, in the list of publica-tions for sale at the Office of the REFORMER, a treatise on the subject of " Dress Reform," which presents a style of dress that, for pro-tection, modesty, and convenience, cannot be excelled. In view of the facts brought to light by the above quotation, let those who have stood as examples in wearing the reform dress take courage when they learn that the reform is gaining ground even in fashionable circles. S. H. LANE. Shall We Throw Physic to the Dogs P WITHOUT professing to be able to demon-strate mathematically, we assert that the effect of medicineŠby which we mean drugs, simply Šlong has been, and still is, greatly overes-timated. We believe that the experience of every well-educated, observing physician will justify the assertion that in more than three-fourths of the diseases which are treated, medi-cines, if they do any good at all, are merely non-essential adjuvants in the recovery of the patient ; that it is doubtful whether the list of mortality would be materially swelled if the physician should ignore all so-called curative drugs, providi  g  he used the same means to sustain and strengthen his patient, and to se-cure the observance of the rules of hygiene. We believe that many a physician alights at the door of some aristocratic mansion, feels the pulse of his patient, looks at his tongue, pre-scribes with all due gravity and formality, re-ceives his fee, and grandly drives away, know-ing, all the while, that the patient needs nothing but fresh air and exercise ; leaving, neverthe-less, in the mind of the patient, the impression that the doctor's services are essential, but car-rying in his own mind the sneaking conviction that he himself is but little better than a hum-bug. The physician may do this without any intention to practice dishonesty, or gain unde-served applause, from the simple habit, so easily formed, of yielding to the mistaken popular  prejudice, that drugs are an essential to the treatment of every disease. Nothing is more probable or more natural than that we should overestimate the virtue of medicine. We do it because we wish to do it. We all expect to be ill, and we wish to believe-that when we become so, we can be cured. Many of us will indulge in violation of the known laws of health, and we wish to believe that the punishment for such violation can be averted. We all wish to have faith in the skill of our physician, and will pardon a great amount of assumption of authority and wisdom on his part. It never excites our jealousy toŁ  hear him extravagantly praised. We like to see him sport a fine turn-ant, and often make him a pet in our households. We will not harbor the suspicion that he is capable of a.  mistake, or that his judgment can be at fault. Some, it is true, in health, profess to believe the doctor a humbug; but when sickness comes, the most swaggering heretic is suddenly con-verted, summons the physician, and swallows the nauseous potion with all the alacrity of a life-long believer. The physician, very naturally, too, allows his. powers and the virtue of his drugs to be over-estimated, because it is flattering to his vanity, and he soon begins to accept the undue appre-ciation of himself and his medicines, as really deserved. Thus it happens that the selfishness. of the patient and the selfishness of the physi-cian alike tend to produce an extravagant esti-mate of the necessity and virtue of medication. It has long been the opprobrium of medicine that there is so little definitely determined and clearly demonstrable with regard to it The uncertainty in its action, the difficulty of determining whether any supposed effect in disease is due to the drug or to some other cause, increases the possibility that its influence may be overestimated. When the power of any force can be demonstrated by mathematical calculation, there will be no room for exagger-ation ; but the effect of a drug cannot be co-determined. An approximate estimate can only be formed by continued observation of its. effect in a multitude of cases. This effect will vary according to the idiosyncrasy of each par-ticular individual. There is a principle of life in all animals and, plants whose tendency is to restore when dis-ease invades ; it has been called " vis medica- trix naturte." If the limb of a plant is injured or broken, this principle tends to restore or re-place the lost member; and unless the injury has been immediately fatal, it accomplishes its. object. There is the same tendency to recover in diseases; and in most cases the recovery will take place without external aid, as we should discover if we would withhold medicines long enough to permit the experiment.
