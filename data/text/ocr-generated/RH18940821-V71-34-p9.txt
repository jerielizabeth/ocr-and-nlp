AUGt18I 21, 1804r ADVENT REVIEW AHD SABBATH HERALb. 537 hearts the gracious gifts which emanate from the sanctuary above. To those who walk in the light, God increases light. But he will not long continue to bestow it upon those who slight it and choose to remain in darkness. To his people in the last days comes this gra-cious assurance : " Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord ; his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth." In the Revised Version, the lan-guage is : " And let us know, let us follow on to know the Lord ; his going forth is sure as the morning," etc. Hos. 6 :3. Just as surely as day succeeds night, so surely will light arise to him who " follows on " to know the Lord. The phi-losophy of this truth is perfectly plain. For " God is light ; " and as we approach the light, it shines more clearly for us. So the nearer we come to God, the more we enjoy of those en-lightening influences that proceed from him. As before remarked, these principles apply equally well in the experiences of the individual or of the church, the body of Christ. The be-nighted wanderer perceives with joy the faint and distant beam of a friendly light that is be-ing carried through the dark wilderness to his own home. The change from utter darkness to the possession of even a single ray of light fills his heart with hope. There is in that guiding ray the assurance of a final welcome home. But he well knows that if he would secure any real good, he must follow that gleam of light. As he draws nearer, his joy increases. He sees more and more clearly his path, and is able to detect and to avoid those obstacles that have caused him delay and pain. He is at no time satisfied with what he has gained, nor does he pause to admire the beautiful light and to con-gratulate himself on his new-found treasure. He does all that while he is pressing forward with earnest haste, lest he lose the precious light. It will not suffice him to stop for one moment until he reach the fullness of the light and warmth of his own loved fireside: Having joined the company that is traveling with the light, he beholds with increasing joy that they are walking in the light which beams upon them directly from the Father's house. Let this simple illustration help to teach us the significance of that injunction of Christ: "Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you. . . . While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light." We can doubtless remember when the light of present truth first reached our hearts. We were bewildered in darkness, groping for light. Perhaps we were upon the dark mountains of sin. A gleam of light suddenly pierced the gloom, and we followed. We became identified with those who were bearing the light, and with them rejoiced. But have we since that time continued to walk? Has our joy in God, our peace in Christ, increased day by day? Are we to-day keeping step with the front rank of that pilgrim band? Or, on the other hand, are we standing where we stood then, and nursing the joyful ex-perience we then had, not having advanced nearer home or nearer Christ? Has the light almost faded out in the distance while we have stood filled with doubt and criticism or covetousness, and the people of God are now almost home? Those who in the earliest days of the message saw the precious light, embraced it, altd held it aloft. That light was not as full and effulgent  as it now is. It was the same light, it beamed from the same Source ; but, thank God, progress has been made. We are nearer home. Christ is nearer. Faith is becoming sight. Much that the early pioneers in the third angel's message saw only by the aid of faith, we see in reality. They laid the foundation, we build thereon ; of their sowing, we are reaping. Of the results of their faith and toil we now have the benefit. The times we live in call for faith, it is true ; but a cloud of witnesses confirm the grounds upon which we stand. The positions hitherto taken are abundantly confirmed in transpiring events ; and continually increasing light demands renewed consecration to God and increased con-fidence in his work. Shall any of us be content to remain stationary in the grace and knowledge of Christ while the advancing light of truth leaves us in greater.dark-ness and bewilderment than before? "The night is far spent, the day is at hand ; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light." G. C. T. THE FOUNTAIN OF EVIL. ONE of our religious exchanges, speaking of the work of Dr. Parkhurst, says : " We need thorough-going reformers who will not stop in their work of reformation till they have reached the fountain of evil, and will insist that the people .must set themselves right before God and his law, by framing the government itself on Christian principles." If we rightly understand the foregoing, the United States government, not being constructed on Christian principles, is the fountain of evil, Šthat is, all the evils which afflict the nation spring from that fountain, .and they might be remedied if the fountain was cleansed by the em-bodiment of Christian principles in the gov-ernment ! A glance at other nations of the world, both past and present, comparing them with ours, will hardly sustain this view. Con-stantine established his government on Christian principles, but the same evils which afflict this nation prevailed in his empire just the same. Theodosius, one of Constantine's successors, was a great national reformer. Those who would not accept Christian principles had no place in his government ; but no historian has declared that the time of the reign of this emperor was any more free from the general evils that ruin mankind than was any other time when these principles were not incorporated in the government. In our own time the empire of Austria and some of the republics of South America claim to be estab-lished upon Christian principles ; but crime pre-vails in those countries just the same as in other countries. Since every kind of government con-ceivable has been tried, and the same evils have continued through them all, the claim that Chris-tian government is the antidote of evil, is proved to be untenable. Furthermore, the proposal to establish a gov-ernment upon Christian principles can never be realized ; it never has been realized in the past. All that has been done and all that will be done in the future in that line, is nothing but a pre-tense. If Christianity were but a creed of rules concerning the relations between man and man, it might be done ; but Christianity relates to God as well as to man ; not only that, but the duties to be rendered to God are left by God himself for each individual to do or not to do, just as each one pleases. If it were not so, if God has  ordained civil government to enforce Christian principles in the duties relating to him, then man's free moral agency toward God is gone, .and God himself has appointed a coercing power to compel men to serve him,--a conclusion re-.volting to reason and contrary to the Scriptures. No government could exist that actually en-forced Christian principles in the present con-dition of human nature. Even the enforcement of creeds, which is as far as any nation has yet gone or can go, has only made hypocrites and sneaking sycophants, without God and without principle. Tale the Christian principle of. non-resistance of evil, as taught by Christ in Matt. 5 : 39. Could a government exist and maintain that principle? What about the Christian principle of loving our enemies? Verse 44. Shall the government pardon the anarchist, the rebel, the brigand, and the thief ? ŠCertainly, if Christian principles are to control the government. Shall a government be established upon Christian principles, and then discriminate, saying, This Christian principle shall be enforced, and this Christian principle shall be held in abeyance? Shall all the law, the "thou shalt" and the "thou shalt not," be enforced, and the pity, love, gentleness, forgiveness, the very spirit and life of the principles of Christianity, be dis-carded? That is the way it always has been in governments so pretending, and that is the way it always will be. But the fountain of evil,Š what is it? where is it ? Is it in the government ? is it in the laws? Man so loves to find an excuse for his own sins ; and if the government is to blame, here is a cause -for all sins ! In short, is the government as now established the fountain of evil? and may it be changed to the fountain that will take away all evil ? Many deluded souls hold to this idea. In both the evil and the good they make the government what it is not. They sink it too low, and then try to raise it too high. They ask it to do the work which Almighty power alone can perform. The evil is in the hearts of men. Thus said the prophet, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." Jesus also bore the following testimony : "For from within [not from within the government, but], out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adul-teries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetous-ness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness." Mark 7 : 21, 22. Here we have the fountain of evil and the evils themselves fully described. Gov-ernment knows no method of eradicating these evils from a single heart. The murderer may be imprisoned for life, but the spirit of murder in his heart is unsubdued. He may grace the scaffold, but he dies impenitent and defiant. Governmental laws are useful in this mixed condition of good and evil ; they hold in check the outbreaking crimes, and make it possible for society to exist, but the government changes no hearts. It may bank the fires of human passion, but it cannot put them out. The gospel of Jesus Christ,Š which is the power of God it-self working in the heart, the very fountain of evil,Š changes the life and eradicates the evil. Government can neither try nor purify the heart. Jesus Christ can do both. "1 the Lord search the heart, I try the reins." "The blood of. Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." He is the fountain opened for sin and unclean-ness. Ile is the all-sufficient remedy. Whoso-ever will can come to him. He is accessible to
