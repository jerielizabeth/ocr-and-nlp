124 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. Vol. 80, No. .31. THE LEGIONARY ANT. AMONG the various species of ants, there is, per-haps, none more calculated to excite our curiosity and arouse our admiration than the legionary ant, a species found in Southern Europe. The follow-ing account of their operations from " Work Days of God, or Science and the Bible," by Herbert W. Morris, D. D., will perhaps be interesting and in-structive to the readers of the INSTRUCTOR :Š "The legionary ants live in great part by plun-der, and enslaving ants of another class. The his-tory of one of their marauding expeditions, as given by Huber, is full of interest, and will serve to convey an idea of their general character. Whilst walking in the environs of Geneva, to-ward the close of a fine summer's day, 'I ob-served,' says he, 'close at my feet, traversing the road, a column of legionary ants. They moved with considerable rapidity, and occupied a space of from eight to ten inches in length, by three or four in breadth. They soon approached a nest in-habited by a colony of the negro ants, the dome of which rose above the grass. Some of the negroes were guarding the entrance ; but, on the discovery of an approaching army, darted forth on the ad-vancing legion. The alarm spre.ad instantly into the interior, whence their companions rushed forth in multitudes to defend their homes. The legion-aries, the bulk of whose army lay only at the dis-tance of two paces, quickened their march, and when they arrived at the hill, the whole battalion fell furiously upon the negroes, who, after an ob-stinate though brief contest, fled to their subter-ranean galleries. The legionaries now.  ascended the dome, collected in crowds on the summit, and' taking possession of the principal avenues, left some of their companions to excavate other open-ings into the exterior walls. They soon effected this, and through the breach the remainder of the army made their entrance ; but in about three or four minutes afterward issued forth again, each carry-ing a pupa, or grub, with which booty they re-traced their route. On arriving at their own en-campment, thus laden with the trophies of victory, their domestic servants, of the same negro race, came forth to welcome the returning warriors, caressing them, and presenting them with food ; whilst the legionaries in their turn, handed over to them their baby captives to be carried into the interior of the nest, there to be nursed and cared for until°  they arrived at maturity. From which it appears that the only object of these predatory expeditions, is to obtain possession of the young, while in the insensible state of pupa, or ant, baby-hood. The plunderers never make prisoners of the old negroes. The consequence is, that all their captives become domesticated without difficulty, and become obedient and useful servants to their ownersŠnursing their young, transporting them from one part of the colony to another, gathering provisions, building new galleries, and acting as faithful guards and sentinels to their captors, who rest tranquilly at the bottom of their subterranean city, till the hour fixed for another expedition ar-rives. To witness such performances carried on among insects, amazes, and well-nigh confounds us ! And the reader, while he wonders at the striking indi-cations of intelligence which they exhibit, may be startled, and, perhaps, shocked, to discovor thus a perfect system of invasion, capture, and slavery, even among ants. But a moment's reflection may serve to relieve his mind. The captives are as well off here as they would have been in their own colony ; they are conscious of no degradation, and fare, in all respects, as well as their masters." WHEN one comes to love his work, his life is a happy one. Vitt. elftriltiven'o tomer. .... .Ł ..... Ł ...... I. I. ... .. GOD SEES ME. THROUGH all the busy daylight, Through all the quiet night; Whether the stars are in the sky, Or the sun is shining bright; In the cottage, in the school-room, In the street, or on the stair, Though I may seem to be alone, Yet God is always there.

V D3 HE other day I heard a mother say to her little girl, "Come, Minnie, get mamma o some wood for her baking, and right away, for I am in a hurry." But Minnie kept on with her play as if she had heard noth-ing. " Come ! Come !" said the hurried mother, " do n't you hear 7 I want some wood." Still the little girl did not stir; and not until the mother had said, "Minnie, if you do not get that wood at once, I shall punish you," did the child make a move. Then she went along very sullenly, muttering and snivelling as she went. " Oh dear !" said the tired mother, " it's more work to get anything out of children than to do it yourself." And so it was all dayŠevery time Minnie's mother asked her to do any little chore, there was just about such a scene. Minnie is a bright little girl, and can play on the organ, and do many things very nicely; but before night we were all tired out with her waiting and whining about everything she was told to do. Did any of you ever see Minnie 7 If you have-n't, I think most.of you have seen some one very much like her. At any rate, whenever I see a boy or a girl start 'to do a thing at the first bidding, I look up surprised and pleased; but it isn't often I am made glad in that way. Now, children, don't you know that willing seeice is always best? When you ask any of your playmates for some little favor, are you not better pleased to have them do it for you at once than to sulk around half an hour, and then do or give it grudg-ingly 7 And do n't you think and sometimes say, "I wish you would n't do it at all, if you are going to act so 3" And quite likely your parents feel in the same way when you are so unwilling to do what they ask of you; but they know you must be made to do it for your own sakes. Now this not " minding the first time " is a very bad habit for children to get, for many differ-ent reasons. In the first place, it makes both yourself and those around you unhappy ; and at the same time makes you more disagreeable than you perhaps desire to be. Then such a habit formed while you are young will be quite likely to cling to you when you are older, and will cause much trouble all your life, by making you 'put off till the last minute things which should be done promptly. It is in this way that many losses and accidents come about every day. Then if you get into this way of putting off these little duties.  which your parents expect of you, it will be quite natural for you to put off giv-ing your hearts to Jesus, and doing the duties which he wants you to do. And if you are trying to serve him now, you must remember that it is in these little ways that you are to serve him, and you must know, too, that you cannot please the Saviour while you are disobeying your parents. Now, children, how many of you have been ill the habit of waiting a second or third bidding to do things 7 Who can answer truly, "I have not"? But now, how many, from this time on, are going to try hard to mind the frirst time you are told ? E. B. Larr JU 8,10asr. ELI). G. C. TENNEY, who is preaching in Wis., says that he is very much interested in the "Letter Budget," and would like to write a letter for it, if it would be proper for one who has been a little boy to do so. He writes :Š " We are having meetings in a large tent in a village on the west shore of Lake Michigan. And for want of a more convenient spot, our tent is pitched in a gentle-man's door-yard, where it covers a balsam tree about twelve feet high. The tree stands by the desk like a huge bouquet of evergreens. Being strangers in the place, we were not sure whether we would have a con- gregation or not. But after our tent was up, we dis-covered that the tree was inhabited by a family of sparrows consisting of the parents and four small chil- dren. They seemed to object to our proceedings ; but we settled with them by leaving an opening in the tent wall, through which they could pass in and out, and all was satisfactory. The parents had their day's work done early, and were on hand at the beginning of each meeting, all remaining very quiet until the close. They never ran in and out, or went for a drink of wa-ter during meeting time ; and in' this they set a good example for many larger parents and children. But their story has a sad ending. Soon the children began to think they were old enough to act for them- selves, and one by one they left their nice home and the good influences of the meetings, and hopped out under the tent wall, much to the sorrow of their par-ents, who wished them to remain a little longer, until they were better prepared to care for themselves. The parents tried to induce them to return, and it was pitiful to hear their cries as they foresaw the dan- ger of their children. But these little ones now had a taste of what they thought was freedom, and cared not for the good advice and cries of those who loved them. Perhaps they thought the sermons too long or did not like the singing, or they were thinking of other little birds who did not have to go to meeting. What became of all of them I know not ; but I saw a cat spring upon one and kill it before it could be rescued, and a few days after, I saw the remains of another. How much better it would have been for them to have heeded the good teaching they had received than it was to have their own way and come to such a cruel fate. At first I was reminded of Psalm 84: 3, 4. But at last I thought of the proverb, "The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth (obeyeth) reproof getteth . understanding." THE YOUTH'S INSTE.ITOTOR Is published weekly by the S. D. a.
