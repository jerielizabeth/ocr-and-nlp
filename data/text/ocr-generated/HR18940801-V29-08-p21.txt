HOME CULTURE. 241 seen little children sweating and smothering in hot summer weather, meanwhile feeling profoundly grate-ful that I was not somebody's baby,Š a poor, little, helpless human dummy at the mercy of some igno-rant mother's caprice or prejudice ! Instructions how to cut and make this desirable little dress may be obtained by application to the Sanitarium Supply Co., Battle Creek, Mich. E. L. S. A MOTHER'S WAGES. IT was an uncouth bird's nest of rushes in which Jochebed moored her birdling " in the flags by the rivet's brink." Little did she know what precious freight she was intrusting to that basket-cradle. And little did Pharaoh's daughter knowŠwhen she took the little foundling out of the floating basket Šwhat manner of child he yet would be. As she hands back the handsome boy into the very bosom that first gave him life, she says to Jochebed, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages." " I will give thee thy wages," says the Egyptian princess to the Hebrew nurse. She got her wages in better coin than silver or gold. She got them in the joys that a mother feels when she yields up a part of herself to sustain her darling child; she got them in the love of the babe she nursed, she got them in the glorious service that her child wrought for Israel in after years. She was paid in the heavenly coin with which God pays good mothers. For all her anxieties and all her efforts to preserve the life of her "goodly child " she was abundantly rewarded. When God lays a new-born babe in the arms of a wedded pair, he says to them," Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages." And the answer of Christian gratitude and faith should be : " 0 Lord, thou hast put thy noblest work into our hands. We accept the precious trust. We will try to stamp on this soft, plastic heart the im-press of a godly example. We will shelter this young life under thy mercy-seat. We will bear with it as thou bearest with us. We will be truthful, that it may never learn falsehood. We will nurse this soul in its infancy with the sincere milk' of love, that in after years it may bear strong meat' for strong service of God and righteousness. 0 God, make our lives in harmony with thee, that this young life may reflect thine image in reflecting ours !" To such pious fidelity God offers the only wages .11 that can satisfy the claims of love. He pays the heart's claim in the heart's own coin. What wages could repay Hannah's prayerful care like the sight  of Samuel's after-career as Israel's upright judge? Moses standing on the mount was the " wages" of the poor Hebrew mother who cradled him in, her basket of rushes. St. Augustine's mighty service for the gospel was the best reward that God could give to Monica. John Wesley's mother was repaid for all her patient discipline when her son built the world-wide tabernacle for Methodism to worship in. George Washington was God's reward to Washing-ton's good mother; as Archibald Alexander, and Brown of Haddington, and Lyman Beecher found their "wages" in the noble sons who took the gos-pel banner from their aged hands. Alas! I have seen other "wages," too, the sad outcome of parental impiety or neglect of duty. -Eli's sin was repaid in Eli's sorrow. I have seen a frivolous, prayerless mother paid in the wages of a broken heart. And when to many a father's door a drunken son has been brought home from a Sabbath-breaking debauch, it was only the wages of that father's sin which a just God was paying. The "wages of sin is death," and of no sin more surely than parental. It is death to peace of mind Š death to domestic happinessŠ death to the neglected or misguided souls of evil offspring. "Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages," is the inscription which God's hand writes on every cradle. " When I dress my child each morning, I pray that Jesus will clothe it Łwith purity," said a good mother to one who inquired her secret of right training. " When I wash it, I pray that His blood may cleanse its young soul from evil ; when I feed it, I pray that its heart may be nourished with truth, and may grow into likeness with the youthful Jesus of Nazareth." Here was religious training from the cradle. It began with the dawn, and its course was like the sun, growing more full-orbed in beauty until the " perfect day." That mother received her golden wages in the early conversion, usefulness, and honor of all her children. What a blessed recompense ! "Go and do thou likewise."Š Theodore L. Cuyler, D D.
