MY God, in me thy mighty power exert; Enlighten, comfort, sanctify my heart; Sweeten my temper and subdue my will; Make me like Jesus; with thy Spirit fill. I want to live on earth a life of faith; I want to credit all the Bible saith; I want to imitate my Saviour's lifeŠ Avoiding lightness, gloom, and sinful strife. I want to bring poor sinners to thy throne; I want to love and honor Christ alone; I want to feel the Spirit's inward power, And stand prepared for each important hour. I want a meek, a gentle, quiet frame, A heart that glows with love to Jesus' name; I want a living sacrifice to be, To Him who died a sacrifice for me. I want to do whatever God requires; I want my heat to burn with pure &sires; I want to be what Christ my Lord commands, And leave myself, my all, in his dear hands. 0 Lord, pour. out thy Spirit on my soul; My will, my temper, and my tongue control; Lead me, through life, to glorify thy grace, That I at length may see thee face to face.

Iniquity abounds, and in consequence, the love of many waxes cold. Corruption flows in the vital cur-rents of the soul, and rebellion against our heavenly Father breaks out in the life. De-pravity spreads its loathsome canker over the entire heart. The moral powers, enslaved by sin, are under the tyranny of unholy appetites and passions. The soul is made the sport of Satan's temptations; and unless some mighty arm is stretched out to rescue him, man goes where the arch-rebel leads the way. It is Satan's regular employment to work for the destruction of the race. Says the apostle Peter, "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may de-vour." Here Satan is represented as prowling about, hoping to find some poor soul off his guard, separated from God, that he may make his prey. Ł .And man in his pride is utterly help-less. He may well tremble at the awful power, cunning, and deception exercised by Satan over all who are not by faith holding fast the hand of Christ. And yet in this time of fearful peril some who profess to be Christians have no family altar. They do not honor God in the home, nor teach their children to love and fear him. There are persons who attempt to teach the  Bible who open their meetings without prayer; and there are not wanting some who profess to be followers of Jesus, and yet argue that there is nothing in the word of God that teaches the duty of vocal prayer. These things grieve me; for I know that continual watchfidness and un-ceasing prayer are necessary for every soul that would successfully resist the wiles of the great deceiver. Those who maintain such po-sitions are not sincere Christians. There are many, who, like unruly children, have separated themselves so far from God that they feel under condemnation in approaching him. They can-not "come boldly unto the throne of grace," "lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting." They have not clean hands; they have not pure hearts; they have no living con-nection with God. Theirs is a form of godli-ness without the power. The idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan's most successful devices to ruin souls. Prayer is addressing the mind to God, the Fountain of wisdom, the Source of strength and peace and happiness. Prayer includes ac-knowledgment of the divine perfections, grati-tude for mercies received, penitential confession of sins, and earnest entreaty for the blessing of God, both fbr ourselves and for others. Jesus prayed to the Father with strong crying and tears. Paul exhorts believers to "pray with-out ceasing." "In everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your re-quests be made known unto God." "Pray one for another," says James. "The effectual fer-vent prayer of Arighteous man availeth much." God has a right to command our devotions; his authority is sacred and unquestionable. We are under obligation to pray because he requires it; and in obeying his requirements we shall receive a gracious and precious reward. I know of nothing that causes me so great sadness as a prayerless home. I do not feel safe in such a house for a single night; and were it not for the hope of helping the parents to realize their necessity and their sad neglect, I would not remain. The children show the result of this neglect; for the fear of God is not before them. Parents should make a hedge about their children by prayer; they should pray with full faith that God will abide with them, and that holy angels will guard them-selves and their children from Satan's cruel power. In every family there should be order, and regular habits. There should be a fixed time to rise in the morning, a time for breakfast, and a time for prayer, either directly before or directly after the morning meal. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their children about them before their fast is broken, and direct their young minds to our heavenly Father, who be-stows upon us the bounties of his providence. Let them thank God for protecting them during the night, and ask for help and grace and the watchcare of angels through the day. Man should not be as unmindful of God as the beasts of the field, that eat and drink, but render no tribute of prayer or grateful praise to their Maker. Beasts have no reagon; but men should understand the great condescension of God to finite, sinful mortals. Fathers and mothers, at least morning and evening lift up your hearts to God in humble supplication for 'yourselves and your children. Your dear ones are exposed to temptations and  trials. There are frets and irritations that daily beset the path of old and young; and those who would live patient, loving, cheerful lives amid daily annoyances, must pray. This victory can be gained only by a resolute and unwavering purpose, constant watchfulness, and continual help from God. The father, who is the priest of his household, should conduct the morning and evening wor-ship. There is no reason why this should not be the most interesting and enjoyable exercise of the home-life, and God is dishonored when it is made dry and irksome. Let the seasons of family worship be short and spirited. Do not let your children or any member of your family dread them because of their tediousness or lack of interest. When a long chapter is read and explained and a long prayer offered, this precious service becomes wearisome, and it is a relief when it is over. It should be the special object of the heads of the family to make the hour of worship in-tensely interesting. By a little thought, and careful preparation for this season, when we come into the presence of God, family worship can be made pleasant, and will be fraught with re-sults that eternity alone will reveal. Let the father select a portion of Scripture that is in-teresting and easily understood; a few verses will 'be sufficient to furnish a lesson which may be studied and practiced through the day. Questions may be asked, a few earnest, inter-esting remarks made, or incident, short and to the point, may be brought in by way of illus-tration. At least a few verses of spirited song may be sung, and the prayer offered should be short and pointed. The one who leads in prayer should not pray about everything, but should express his needs in simple words, and praise God with thanksgiving. Abraham, the friend of God, set us a worthy example. His was a life of prayer and humble obedience, and he was as a light in the world. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar, calling for the morning and evening sacrifice of each member of his family. When his tent was removed, the altar remained. The roving Canaanite, as he came across that altar, knew who had been there be-fore him; and when he had pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and worshiped the living God. From Christian homes a similar light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gen-tle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes where these principles are carried out,Šhomes where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From these homes morning and evening prayer comes up before God as sweet incense, and his mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the morning dew. We must have more religion. We need the strength and grace that are born of earnest prayer. This moans of grace should be dili-gently used in order to gain spiritual muscle. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to him. It makes us realize more and more our great needs, and hence our obli-gation to God and our dependence upon him. It loads us to feel our own nothingness and the weakness of our judgment. God has made earnest prayer the condition of the bestowal of his richest blessings. Prayer
