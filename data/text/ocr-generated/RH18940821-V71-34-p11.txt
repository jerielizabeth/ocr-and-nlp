AUGUST 21, 1894]" ADVENT-  REVIEW AHD SABBATH HERALD. 539 rogntss the "He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed' shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."ŠPs. 126 : 6. " THE WATERED LILIES." THE Master stood in his garden, Among the lilies fair, Which his own right hand had planted, And trained with tenderest care. He looked at their snowy blossoms, And marked with observant eye That his flowers were sadly drooping, And their leaves were parched and dry. "My lilies need to be watered," The heavenly Master said; " Wherein shall I draw it for them, And revive each drooping head? Close to his :feet on the pathway, Empty and frail and small, An earthen vessel was lying, Which seemed no use at all. But the Master saw, and raised it From the dust in which it lay, And smiled as he gently whispered, " This shall do my work to-day. It is but an earthen vessel, But it lay so close to me; It is small, but it is empty, That is all it needs to be." So to the fountain he took it, And filled it full to the brim; How glad was the earthen vessel, To be of some use to him. He poured forth the living water, Over his lilies fair, Until the vessel was empty, And again he filled it there; And so the lilies were watered, Until they revived again; And the Master saw with pleasure, His labor had not been in vain. His own hand had drawn the water Which refreshed the thirsty flowers; But he used the earthen vessel To convey the living showers; And unto itself it whispered, As he laid it down once more, Still will I lie in his pathway, Just where I lay before; Close would I keep to the Master, Still empty would I remain, And perhaps some day he may use me To water his flowers again. Š8elected. OHIO. FROM July 9-31, in company with brother Irwin, president of the Conference, I held meet-ings at seven places in northeastern Ohio. We were glad to see the manifest interest to hear the truth concerning the present state of affairs in the world, and what these things mean. Al-though some of our meetings were in the country, during the week, and also in the time of harvest and threshing, the people said they never saw so many out to hear the truth in those places. The interests of the school at Mt. Vernon were pre-sented before our people by brother Irwin, and the prospect seems to be fair for an increased at-tendance the coming winter. At the time of our meeting in Cleveland the great national convention of the Christian Endeavor Association was held. There seemed to be a great amount of zeal and enthusiasm manifested among them. Judging from the tenor of their speeches that were printed in the papers, one would judge that their hope of con-verting this nation, and, in fact, the conversion of the world, was for the Church to get control of the ballot-box, and proclaim Christ "Lord of all " by going to the polls and putting church-men into office. One speaker wanted to see " the dollar mark placed over Christ's head." He did not fully explain what he meant by that. Some inferred that he meant that he wanted Christ's likeness on the coins of the country, and the dol-lar mark over that likeness. When, anciently, one of Caesar's coins was presented for our Lord's inspection, he said : "Render to Cmsar the  things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." The Endeavorers sang with a will, and often ex-pressed the same in their speeches, "The world is getting better." For all these assertions the careful observer of the scenes in the world sees that God's word is truer than men's songs. The Lord has said, "Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse," and that " in the last days . . . men shall be lovers of their own selves, . . . having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." One of the places of our meetings was Kirt-land, Ohio, near the point where the first Mor-mon temple was erected, in 1834, under the immediate direction of Joseph Smith. After fifty years the house is in a good state of preser-vation. Through the courtesy of one of the members, we were taken through all parts of the temple, he explaining to us the service of their two priesthoods. In the east end of the audito-rium were raised seats for the Aaronic priesthood, and in the west end were the seats for the Mel-chisedec priesthood, while the congregation was to occupy the space between the two. The query arose in my mind, How can such worship-ers apply the testimony of the Lord by the apos-tle Paul, in the book of Hebrews, concerning " the priesthood being changed," if we are still under the Aaronic priesthood ? If the Lord, who is our high-priest, is "of the tribe of Judah, of which Moses spake nothing concerning the priest-hood," and if, as he says, " there is verily a disannulling " of the command that said our priest must be of the house of Aaron and the tribe of Levi, what do we need of Aaronic priests ? I did not spend much time in trying to solve the problem, being content to accept Christ as my high-priest, 6  after the order of Melchise-dec," a Priest who can be " touched with the feelings of our infirmities," and leave the priest-hood of Aaron among the shadows which have found their better substance in the more glori-ous ministration of the Lord Jesus. J. N. LOUGHBOROUGH. QUEBEC. JULY 10, I left Fitch Bay, for Ottawa, On-tario. While there, I visited scattered Sabbath-keepers in Stittsville, Ironside, Cantler, and Angers. I met Elder A. F. Ballenger at Bucking-ham, Sabbath, July 10. About twenty-seven persons were present at the meeting. After the Sabbath-school brother Ballenger gave us a timely discourse on present truth. The dis-course was followed by a good social meeting. July 21 we held meetings with the church in Ottawa. Three were baptized, and taken into the Buckingham church. The ordinances were celebrated, and a leader and a treasurer were chosen. July 28 I was with the church at Fitch Bay. Four were baptized. Two united with the church.  there, and two are to unite with the church at South Stukely. J. B. G 00DRICH. THE WORK IN MICHIGAN AND ONTARIO. THERE are ten tent companies at work in the Michigan Conference this season, besides several other laborers working in school-houses. Per-haps we have never had greater difficulty in get-ting the attention of the people than at first, but the Lord has. helped us greatly, and nearly all our workers are doing well. Four tent com-panies are at work in Ontario, and all are having a good hearing. Our mission work in Detroit is growing, and there is a better interest there now than at any other time since our work started. Sabbaths and Sunday nights our chapel is nearly full. Those who have been having Bible readings are so interested that our workers have been unable to take their annual vacation. The mis- sion work in Toronto is also prosperous. God has given our workers marked success there in getting people into the truth, but they are, slow to attend meetings. When asked to come, they say, " 0 yes, we want to come ; where do you hold meet-ings ? " and when they are told that they are held in a private house, they say they cannot come. We must soon have a house of wor-ship in Toronto. Many of our brethren are laboring in a quiet way, and are bringing souls into the truth. Our churches have taken, and we hope circulated, be-tween 30,000 and 40,000 copies of the tract, "What Do These Things Mean ? " Our camp-meetings are now coming on, and we hope for a general attendance. I. H. EvANs. ONTARIO. SELTON.Š Our interest here is unabated. The people come from far and near. Ten have de-cided to keep the Sabbath, and others are deeply interested. Some have come up to the cross and decided to go no farther. At our first Sabbath meetings we urged all to come and study the subject with us. Thus the people began to come before they decided to keep the Sabbath. We did not urge obedience until our third Sabbath meeting. This has worked well. The enemy has an active agent who goes about like a roaring lion, doing all he can to turn away the people ; but it only deepens the interest. All we have to do with him is to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. The present prospects are very encouraging. LATER. ŠThe work here is advancing. We can report eighteen keeping the Sabbath, and the end is not yet. The people are slower in making decisions than in some of the States. Although we have held meetings for six weeks, the interest is still deepening. The Lord has a people here to make ready -for his coming. A. 0. BURRILL, P. M. HowE. MICHIGAN. NORTH BRANCH.Š The community here where we are holding meetings, is composed mostly of Roman Catholics and Lutherans. Seven precious souls have taken their stand for the truth, and others are almost persuaded. Shortly after we commenced holding meetings, there was a great deal of wet weather, and the farmers began to feel anxious in regard to their crops...s The Catholics reported that " those Advents who are holding meetings are the cause of it all, and as long as they continue their meetings, it will continue to rain." All sorts of queer stories are circulated by them, but instead of shaking the faith of those who are interested, it convinces them more and more that this message must be truth, or there would not be so much prejudice against it. Truly the truth, as the Saviour said, causes division, and we see it here to some extent. A lady whose husband is a Roman Catholic has taken her stand for the truth ; also a young lady whose parents say she cannot keep the Sabbath and live at home. But we are glad to see them all stand so firmly for the truth. WM. SI1VIPSON. MINNESOTA. LAMBERTON.Š Since our last report we have continued to labor in this place, seeking with God's assisting grace to hold up the light of his most precious truth, both from the desk and by the distribution of literature. Our meetings have been of interest to a few only, the congregations ranging from four to twenty-five. Had we looked at the vacant seats, we should have been discouraged long before
