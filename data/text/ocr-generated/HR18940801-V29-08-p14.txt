EXERCISE AND SYMMETRY. BY J. H. KELLOGG, M. D. EXERCISE brings into active play the muscles which control the chest. Every time we breathe we move the ribs; and at the same time the cartilages by which the ribs are attached to the spine behind and to the sternum in front are also stretched and bent. Now if these movements are neglected, and we depend entirely for breath upon the movements of the dia-phragm,Š and there are a great many persons who do depend entirely upon the diaphragm,Šwe are never able fully to distend the chest, because, as the result of the neglect of movement, the cartilages have become hardened, and the joints are no longer flexible Š they have lost their power to bend and stretch ; the chest has become rigid. Such a person cannot increase the size of his chest to any great degree. It is only by stretching the diaphragm down as far as possible that he is able to increase the capacity of his chest at all. His breath-ing capacity is thus limited, and he easily gets out of breath. This is one reason why an old person can-not run well. Another point worthy of consideration is the effect of exercise upon the joints of the spine. As already stated, each joint of the vertebral column contains a fibro-cartilaginous body between the bodies of the vertebra, the purpose of which is to render the ver-tebral column flexible. By means of these ingen-iously constructed joints we can bend the body in every direction. Now suppose we do not bend the trunk in every possible direction many times a day, or often enough to keep these joints flexible, what will be the result ?Š These cartilages which lie be-tween the vertebra, and which form about one fourth of the entire vertebral column, will become, in time, inflexible and rigid. The ligaments also which bind the vertebra together will lose their flexibility, and thus the ability to bend the spine will be lost. Fur-ther than this, the muscles which support the spine, being attached to the ribs and to the spines of the vertebra, become rigid and shortened when they are not stretched by frequent backward-bendings, side-bendings, forward-bendings, etc. This is the reason why we find most old people unable to bend the trunk freely. How many persons even among those of middle age, are able to bend forward and touch the floor without bending the knees? You ask an old gentleman to touch the floor, bending only at the hips; and if he succeeds in getting over far enough to reach the floor, he does wonderfully well. Why is this ?Š It is because of the consolidation of the spinal column. If this same old gentleman had be-gun thirty or forty years ago to take regular exercise of this kind, he would not have lost his ability to bend the spine. At the age of fifty or sixty, or even at forty-five, a person whose spine has become rigid from lack of exercise, will nbt be likely to improve in this direction so as to be able to touch the floor without bending the knees, unless unusually well preserved. But you say, " What harm if a man cannot touch the floor without bending his knees ? Is n't he just as well off physically as the man who can do so ?" By no means. This stiffness of the spine, especially in the lower regions, always involves a correspond-ing weakness of the abdominal muscles. When the spine is as rigid as a jury mast, the body is held erect 0 a ( 2 3 4 )
