226 GOOD       sal agitation and raving the sight of it threw us into. I flattered myself that some, by preserving an equal temper of mind, might outlive the night ; but now the reflection which gave me the greatest pain was that I sawno possibility of one's escaping to tell the dismal tale. Until the water came, I had not myself suffered much from thirst, which instantly grew excessive. We had no means of conveying it into the prison but by hats forced through the bars; and thus myself, and Coles. and Scott sup-plied them as fast as possible. But those who have experienced intense thirst, or are acquainted Kith the cause and na-ture of this appetite, will be sufficiently sensible it could receive no more than a momentary alleviation : the cause still existed. " Though we brought full hats through the bars, there ensued such violent struggles and frequent contests to get it, that before it reached the lips of any one, there would be scarcely a small teacupful left in them. These supplies, like sprinkling water on fire, only seemed to feed the flames. Oh ! my dear sir, how shall I give you a just conception of what I felt at the cries and cravings of those in the remoter parts of the prison, who could not entertain a probable hope of ob-taining a drop, yet could not divest them-selves of expectation, however unavailing, calling on me by the tender considerations of affection and friendship. The confusion now became general and horrid. Several quitted the other window (the only chance they had for life) to force their way to the water, and the throng and press upon the window was beyond bearing; many, forcing their way from the farther part of the room, pressed down those in their pas-sage who had less strength, and trampled them to death. "From about nine to eleven I sustained this cruel scene, still supplying them with water, though my legs were almost broken with the weight against them. By this time I myself was near pressed to death, and my two companions, with Mr. Parker, who had forced himself to the window, were really so. At last I became so presses and wedged up, I was deprived of all mo-tion. Determined to give everything up, I called to them, as a last instance of their regard, that they would relieve the press-ure upon me, and permit me to retire out of the window to die in quiet. They gave way, and with much difficulty I forced a passage into the center of the prison, where the throng was less by the many dead, amounting to one-third, and the numbers who flocked to the windows ; for by this time they had water also at the other window  I laid myself down on some of the dead, and, recommending myself to heaven, had the comfort of think-ing my sufferings could have no long du-ration. " My thirst now grew insupportable, and the difficulty of breathing much in-creased; and I bad not remained in this, situation ten minutes before I was seized with a pain in my breast, and palpitation of heart, both to the most exquisite degree. These obliged me to get up again, but still the pain, palpitation, and difficulty of breathing increased. I retained my senses notwithstanding, and had the grief to see death not so near me as I had hoped, but could no longer bear the pains I suffered without attempting a relief; which I knew fresh air only would and could give me. I instantly determined to push for the window opposite to me, and by an effort of double the strength I ever before pos-sessed, gained the third rank at it≈†with one band seized a bar, and by that means gained a second, though I think there were at least six or seven ranks between me and the window. In a few moments the pain, palpitation, and difficulty of breath-ing ceased, but the thirst continued intol-erable. I called aloud, Water for God's sake.' "I had been concluded dead; but as soon as the men found me among them, they still had the respect and tenderness for me to cry out, 'Give him water!' nor would one of them at the window attempt to touch it till I had drunk. But from the water I had no relief; my thirst was rather increased by it; so I determined to drink no more, but patiently wait the event. I kept my mouth moist from time to time by sucking the pers..iration out of my shirt sleeves, and catching the drops as they fell like heavy rain from my head and face; you can scarcely imagine how unhappy I was if any of them escaped my mouth. . . . I was observed by one of my companions on the right in the expe-dient of allaying my thirst by sucking my shirt sleeve. lie took the hint, and robbed me from time to time of a considera-ble part of my store, though, after I de-tected him, I had the address to begin on that sleeve first when I thought my reser-voirs were sufficiently replenished, and our mouths and noses often met in contact.
