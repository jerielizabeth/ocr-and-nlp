471 No. 8.1 THE REV IEW AND HERALD. 59 prepared, if we have no present delight in what are said to be its joys ! Is it not good to hope and wait when each moment may add a jewel to the crown ? And shall it be said of any among us, that they heard of Heaven, but made no effort to behold it ? Are there any who can be indifferent to the announcement of its glories ? Is there one who can feel utterly careless whether he ever prove for himself that it is indeed a surpassingly fair land, which is to be the everlasting home of those that love God and keep his command- meats ? The walls of that city shall never decay. The lustre of that city shall never grow dim. The melodies of that city shall never be hushed. And is it of a city such as this that any one of us should be indifferent ? Who would think that any, old or young, rich or poor, would delay to make the solemn vow that they will seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, that they may share the glories of Heaven, where we shall feel his influence cheering and enlivening and supporting our frame, in a manner of which we now have no conception. Oh who will not adopt some such reflection and prayer as this; I have heard of Heaven ; I have been told of its splendors and of its happiness ; grant gracious Fa- ther, that I fail not at last to be associated with those who shall rejoicingly exclaim, As we have heard for he has promised that he that overcometh shall in- herit all things.

It costs something to be a Christian. You will find the Ian- guage of the Bible all true. You will find that "they who will live godly in, Christ Jesus, shall suffer per- secution." But as a reward of faithfulness here, you will know from happy experience, that "great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them." Ps, cxix, 165. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Rev. xxii, 14. Reader, men's hearts are now failing them for fear of those things which are coming upon the earth; while there is a company who are lifting up their heads, knowing that their redemption draweth nigh. A storm of wrath is already gathering, soon to over- take a guilty world, and sweep into destruction those who fear not God, and keep not his command- ments. Escape for thy life. W. S. FOOTE. Pendleton, 0. shall bow and every tongue confess ; for " God's hand will find out all," and men shall know if not now that his eye has not slumbered upon their wickedness. Brethren let us, who profess "not to be in darkness," acknowledge the Most High by humbly walking in obedience to all his commandments. That we may be acknowledged of him when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. L. Let It Pass. Be not swift to take offense ; Let it pass! Anger is a foe to sense ; Let it pass !

God Rules in the Kingdom of Men. so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts;Echo Let it pass!  .ABOUT the history of Nebuchadnezzar there is some- thing wonderfully impressive. From the highest of hu- man distinctions sinking out of the level of his race, the extremes meet in his life as in no case on record. As with the great of earth generally, so dazzled had he become with the glory that surrounded him, he saw no higher than the dome of his own greatness, and so failed to acknowledge Him, by whom all rulers are ruled. The language of his heart instead of being "0 Lord. how manifold are thy works" is expressed when he walked in his palace with stately tread, and ex- claimed, " Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of myTime power, and for the honor of my majesty." But there comes a voice from heaven starting fearfully the proud king from his revery. " Oh king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken : The kingdom is departed from thee : and they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field : they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." Severe indeed, are the lessons by which God teacheth an individual or nation, humility ; and  terribly does he sometimes demonstrate that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men. As a nation, with a feeling akin to Nebuehadnezzar's while surveying Babylon, have we looked upon our Republic, and this feeling would not have been rep- rehensible perhaps, had it been founded upon justice and mercy. But as great as the institutions of which we boast, are the sins of which we are guilty ; and according to these, may we expect that our punishment be meted out. Had the Chaldean king heeded the counsel of the of his dreams, " to break off his sins by righteousness, and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor" the tranquility of his kingdom might have been perserved. And had we remembered, although on the side of the oppressor there might be power, that it was righteousness alone that exalted a nation, the calamities that are befalling us would have been averted. But hardened in sin, we know, is the heart of this great nation ; for while " war lifts his helmet to his brow," in our midst, and tumult and, confusion prevail throughout the land, when men have " much to fear and little to expect" instead of turning from these things as Pilgrim turned from the city of Destruc- tion and crying, " Life, life, eternal life !" men close their ears that they may not hear the cries of the dis- tressed and dying, and madly rush on, as never before, in the pursuit of perishable wealth. Smitten, but not humbled, we still hear them all around us, speaking haughtily concerning oppression ; and pride, at unparallelled expense, still adorns her- self, and parades our streets, whilst truth, like an outcast, receives the warmest welcome at the door of the humble. But the day of the Lord is upon us when every knee truth that you are willing to lay aside all your " isms,"Let the Lord? Are you willing to sacrifice all that youLet mandments which I have written." With these remarksthat To the Honest Hearted. Š As we believe that there are such persons, not con- netted with us in church capacity, I wish to ask such a few questions relative to a subject of profound ins- portance to both of us. In the first place, are you so anxious to get at the that you may understand what is the mind and will of are, and have in this world, for the truth ? It may seem superfluous to put such questions to the honest hearted. I do it because some may think they are so, but are not. Friendly reader : if you and I get ready for the coming of our Lord, and unite with all the sanctified in singing the song of redeeming love, we must dig down deep into our hearts, and throw out all that the world, the flesh and the Devil have buried there. Our bodies must be the temple of the Holy Ghost. °' If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." Rom, viii, 9. Are you leading a watchful and prayerful life? In Prov. xxviii, 9, it is said, "Ile that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." And in Ps. lxvi, 18, " If I regard in- iquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." What is iniquity ? Is it not sin ? Is not sin a " transgression of the law ?" Are you at any loss about what is meantwill by the law of God? In Ex, xxiv, 12, God said to Me- see, "I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and corn-interpreter I will leave you to find the place in the Bible where we are told that the Sabbath of the Lord has ceased to ex- ist, or where the Sabbath, or Lord's day has been changed by divine authority from the seventh to the first day of the week ; or the place, where we are informed that the law of ten commandments has been abrogated by the law-giver. Surely you cannot refer to the language of our Saviour, " I came not to destroy the law," or to Rom, ii, 18 : " For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified ;" or to Rom, iii, 31 : "Do we make void the law through faith ? God forbid ; Yea we establish the law." Now, dear friend, I would advise you not to place yourself in a position, where the Lord will not hear you, when you attempt to address a throne of grace, but fear God and keep his commandments." If you are "justified by faith," you will love God, love his holy law, delight in obeying all its holy requirements. The Sabbath will not be to you a yoke of bondage, but you will "call it a delight, holy unto the Lord, honorable." Isa. lviii, 13. You will be willing to leave all your er- rocs, and your conformity to the fashions and maxims The Power of Christ's Coming. Š SAYS E.. Bickersteth, 0. D., The certainty and the nearness of the Lord's coming, and the duty of wait-ing for it, are now, blessed be God, much more gen- orally acknowledged and realized. I trust that the hearts of Christians are becoming more and more es- tablished in this solemn reality. That it is not a mere careless repetition of words when they say, Ire believe thou shalt come to be our Judge; and when they say in the creed, He -sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the  quick and the dead. Doubt not of the fact at all. Be expecting it, and be waiting for it; earnestly desire to  be ready and prepared for it. Lord, we believe; help thou our unbelief ! Oh, may we live more and more in the light of this coming judgment, and accustom our-selves to view everything with constant reference to it. The bringing near of the final judgment, and the real-izing of the wrath then to descend on the wicked, and the promised glory then to be bestowed on the right-eous, are full of weighty influence on all our duties. The solemnities and infinite magnitude of the judge meat, its irreversible issue, and its eternal decision of our future state, as inhabitants of hell or heaven; and the assurance that the Judge now standeth at the door,  cannot fail to quicken every one who receives God's  testimony in simple faith. SATAN is ever pleased when we sit down and brood over our misfortunes, for then he knows we shall be forgetful of God's favors. i
