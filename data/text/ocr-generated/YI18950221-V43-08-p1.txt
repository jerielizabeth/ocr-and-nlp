THE FAROE ISLANDS. IN the Atlantic Ocean, about two hundred and seventy miles southeast of Iceland and one hundred and ninety miles northwest of Shet-land, lies this group of some twenty-two rocky islands, about seventeen of which are inhabited, having in the aggre- gate a surface of five hundred and  find a chess-board. Since the laws of 1854 these islands have had their own Lagthing, or law-making body, consisting of eighteen chosen persons, at the head of whom are the Amtman (commandant or governor) and the Probst (rector of the church). In secular matters their last appeal is made to the mayor of Copenhagen, and in church affairs to the bishop of Zealand. Their only city and market is Thornshavn on Stromtie, with little over one thousand inhabitants, possessing a good port with a strand battery ; also a school with two teachers, for a more liberal education.  their spring vestments. Tourists who have hitherto written about these islands have with very few exceptions given them a character al-together more sad and gloomy than the reality warrants. Often, too, those who have painted such desolate pictures have tarried only a few days in the country, and not seldom at a time when heavy fogs extended over the coasts, intensified by the howling storm, or ≈Å when the flourishing mountain-slopes were covered by white clouds." M. H. Labonne, who visited Faroe in the month of June, records the tem-perature as very agreeable, being forty-five fourteen square miles, and, ac-cording to the census of 189o, twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty-four inhabitants, who are called Faroese. The unco m-monly steep mountains of these islands range all the way from one thousand to two thousand eight hundred feet in height, Slat-teretind o n Osteroe being t h e culminating point. The largest isle of the group is StrOmoe (six and one-half square miles, with nearly three thousand inhabit-ants), on which stands the Skal-ingefield, two thousand two hun-dred and sixty-seven feet high. Thornshavn is its leading city, and Westmanshavn, a good port for vessels. The islands of Os- Syderoe, Vaagoe, Sandt5e, and Bordoe deserve special men-tion. The climate is moderate at all times of the year, taking into consideration that the group lies between sixty-one and sixty-two degrees north latitude ; but the breezes from the sea are very damp. The winter is mild ; snow ROCKS OF TROLD-NYPEN. remains seldom longer than eight days. The mean temperature for the summer months is about fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Storms are frequent. The soil is rocky, but in spots where a thicker layer of arable ground prevails, is very fertile. Storms hinder altogether the growth of trees, but there is no lack of coal, peat, and some driftwood. Cattle are of small stature, but the horses are exceedingly strong. Thousands of sea-fowl inhabit the cliffs, especially the so-called Vogelberg (Bird Mountain). The language of the natives is a dialect of the old Norwegian tongue, but at court, in church and school, and in general print, the Danish is used. The chief pursuits are cattle-raising, fishing, anti fowling, and the gathering of featherdown (eiderdown, from the feathers of the eiderduck). Their favorite amusement is chess-playing, and in every house one can These islands were peopled by the Norwe-gians in the ninth century, and in 138o they came into possession of the Danish crown. So much as to their history. Now, what does nature offer here ? " To find a smiling aspect at the Faroe Islands," said M. Ch. Edmond, a great trav-eler, "it would be necessary to be tossed ashore there by a tempest ! But he who can, under such adverse circumstances, find attrac-tions here, will agree with us when we say, They are there all the year around in all kinds of weather, and surely so, if one comes there from Iceland, for instance, that Ultima Thule of the northern world, leaving it clad in a mantle of snow and ice, whilst the little isles of Faroe seem to be entirely rid of their white sepulchral sheet, and once more attired in  degrees Fahrenheit in the morning, and fifty-nine degrees Fahrenheit at noon ; the rain lasted but a little while, and he found con-stantly that what he had read about the islands did not agree with the reality. He writes : " Cultivated lands and pasture grass in broad bands of living green contrasted beautifully with the black basalt rocks that formed their borders. " This lovely temperature is due to the slight elevation of the valleys and to the Gulf Stream, that bathes these islands, and envelops them with its hot vapors. Thus the climate here is the most even of any in Europe, the difference between winter and summer being only fifty-two degrees Fahrenheit. As little as in Iceland does one find trees in the open fields, the hur-ricanes uprooting them ; but in well-protected
