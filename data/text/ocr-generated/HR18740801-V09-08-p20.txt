24.4. THE HEALTH REFORMER. there need of reform in this particular ? I think it can easily be shown to be true. How much whisky, beer, wine, and eider, is annually consumed by the farmers and their families I It is not many years since it was thought that a man could not endure the work of haying and harvesting without stimulation from one or more of these beverages. In this particular an improvement has been commenced. But, notwithstanding, farmers still drink enor-mous quantities of intoxicating liquors. I can name a town near where I am writing in which there are, at least, half a dozen grog saloons, supported mainly by the farming com-munity within ten miles of the town. Each of these must derive a yearly income of a thousand dollars, or more. This makes a tax of $6000 per annum, for a poison, the largest part of which is poured down the throats of farmers. But this is only the half. Allowing that the mate-rial costs the liquor vender one half of what he charges his customer, and the tax foots up to $12,000. This alone would be sufficient to pay the expenses of a first-class agricultural college, and make the tuition free to all. But we do not patronize grog shops. So say a host of farmers. Yes ; but how much do you pay for tobacco ? If you use a moderate quan-tity, you pay for it an amount which, if invested annually at ten per cent interest, would be sufficient to support you at the age of seventy yearsŠabout as much as most farmers have saved when they arrive at that time of life. We do not use tobacco. So say many more of my friends. How much does it cost you for tea and coffee1 These things do not contribute an iota,to the well-being of those who use them. The money spent on them is thrown awayŠa needless waste. We do not use these, answer a few. Well, but how much do your families pay for corsets, lace, and gewgaws of dress, which are only a senseless imitation of the fashionable ladies of our American cities ? How much does it cost for pies, cakes, pastry, and other extravagances of the table ? I mean, how much does it cost including the labor of your wives and daughters? But I am not done yet. Before you tell me what it costs the farmers for spirituous liquors, tea, coffee, tobacco, superfluous dress, and ex-travagances of the table, please add to the sum total the cost of doctors, nurses, drug shops, and the whole expense of sickness in the farmers' families. These things which I have enumerated, to-gether with other bad habits of living, are what bring sickness, with its long train of evils, into your families. What, can we avoid sickness Certainly. I would not have you dismiss your physician when sick ; but I maintain that you can learn to live so that you will seldom get sick, and will be able to take care of those in  your own family, and very seldom need medical advice. One more point, my friends. The American portion of the rural population of our country shows signs of the speedy growth of an evil which, unless it be checked, will work its utter ruin. I refer to a growing social evil in the family relation. The native population of New England, according to the best authorities, is decreasing in numbers. This decline, among any people, is the certain index of the most fearful social corruption. It shows a poisoning of the fountains of life. This mighty tide of evil has not yet been much felt throughout the farming districts of the West ; but it is making its appearance, and in a generation will do more to ruin the farmers than all manner of public reforms, and all possible legislation, can do to save them. I am not now going to discuss this question. I will only say that the grangers cannot occupy themselves better than by facing it manfully, and attempting to enlighten the people in such a way that a reform may become possible. I have only indicated some particulars in which reform is needed among the farming com-munities of our country. My remarks are in-tended to be suggestive. The salvation of farm-ers from the evils which threaten, can be accomplished only by getting at these roots of evil, and eradicating them. Now to return to my first statement, that a strict attention to the subjects mentioned in the resolution of the Rockford grange will enable the farmers to put down all opposition, and become the best educated, most moral, wealthy, and most intellectual portion of the population of the United States. A strict attention to these personal reforms which I have enumerated, will awaken a tone of moral earnestness which, in time, will make them the most moral people of the land. The economy of resources will give them the means with which to establish agricultural schools quite equal to any educa-tional institutions in the country. The phys-ical and mental vigor developed by the tem-perate habits of living, which I suggested, will make their children more capable of learn-ing than any other students in our schools and colleges. The absence of disease will create a desire for wealth, and at once give the means for its steady pursuit. Then, putting these influences together, they will so rise in the scale of real manhood that the mechanics and labor-ers of the whole country will follow their lead, and they will hold in their hands the political power of the Republic.
