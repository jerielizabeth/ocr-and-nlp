WILCOX, EDITOR. In Love with Themselves.ŠA writer in-the New York Voice reports a leader of a love feast among the colored people in the South as saying, "All in love with God, their fellow-men, and themselves, will come forward and partake." As being expressive of the colored man's religion, we have nothing to say, for he may not have meant what he said; but the expression "in love with . . . themselves" aptly expresses much of present-day religion. But Christ was not in love with himself, for he "pleased not himself," and commanded every disciple to. "deny himself." It is. only by being emptied of self that we may become like Christ ; but he who is in love with him-self will have no room for Christ. Every false religion in the 'world is based upon a love of self. Though men have called it love of God, it is but the worship of the god self. The "Independent" and the Pope.ŠThe Inde-pendent of July 19 has an article on "The Pope's Appeal for ChUrch Union." It con-tains many excellent things, and we would that Protestants would heed the practical suggestions therein set forth, and that the 'In-dependent itself would do likewise. The ed-itor says: "But we tell him [the pope] that with a great price we have obtained our freedom, and we propose to stand fast to it; and that we believe that the futureof-the world and its present influence and power, under the guidance of the Divine Spirit, are with Protestantism rather than with Catholicism." All this in a sense is true; but Protestantism is Protestantism only so long as it stands fast to and walks in the principles laid down by the Protestants of tfie Reformation. We are not only to stand fast in the liberty, but we are to stand fast by walking in the liberty. The basic principles of Protestantism are God's word and God's word alone, and the absolute non-interference of the civil magis-trate with things ecclesiastical. From these fundamental principles the Protestant church has wofully departed, has stepped over the  line,Ł in the words of another, which divides Protestantism from popery, and can give DO valid reason why she should not ac-cept all the papal dogmas.. Herein is the weakness of so-called Protestantism at the present time. Its numerous creeds on some very vital points are diverse from the word of God. It has, in nearly all cases, when the two have come in conflict, rejected the word and held to the creed. It will do this again, and in the conflict between Roman Ca-tholicism and the great so-called Protestant churches, he who reads the signs of the times aright, not from personal bias, but in the light of the sure word of prophecy, can see but the triumph of Roine. And yet God's true Prot-estants will hold to his word in spite of all the persecutions and trials of earth,Šwill consider a "Thus saith the Lord" more than all the customs and traditions of the fathers of the church. The acceptance or rejection of the message which they are bearing to the world,Šthe gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,Šwill prove the salvation or destruction of the generations of men now on the earth. Would that, while Protestants are boasting of their Protestantism, they would return to first prin-ciples, and be Protestants, or Christians, in deed and in truth. THE INCONSISTENCY OF APOSTASY. AN illustration of the inconsistency al-ways found connected with those churches which have apostatized from the word of God is presented in a late ruling of the Roman Catholic Bishop Watterson, of Columbus, 0., and the sustaining of this decision by the papal ablegate Satolli. Bishop Watterson during the last lecture season decided, as re-ported in the public press:Š Ł I hereby withdraw my approbation from any and every Catholic Society in this diocese that has a liquor dealer or saloon keeper at its head or any-where among its officers, and I suspend every such society itself from its rank and privileges as a Cath-olicosociety until it ceases to be so officered. No one who is engaged either as principal or agent in the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors should be admitted to Membership. Concerning this Satolli says:- - The liquor Ł traffic, and especially as conducted here in the United States, is the sOurce'of much evil, hence the bishop was acting within his rights in seeking to restrict it. Therefore the delegate apos-tolic sustains Bishop Watterson's action, and ap-proves of his circular and regulation concerning saloons, and the expulsion of saloon keepers from membership in Catholic societies. We do not believe that liquor dealers have any place in religious societies; but the point we wish to make is this: If these. men are qualified for church membership, are they  notŁqualified morally (for this is the point in question) for membership in any other reli-gious society? If they are not worthy to be-long to a church society, are they worthy to be-long to the chUrch itself? Now according to the Scriptures the church is the "spouse of Christ," "the body of Christ," his representa-tive on the earth. This is, we believe, just what the Roman Catholic Church claims of herself. Yet she places above the church the various societies connected with the church. Some or all of Rome's societies have more or less secrecy connected with them. Are the drinkers excluded because they are liable to become too voluble and talkative? In the Bible we find but one society through whom the Lord works in the world, in which he dwells, which he calls his body. It is "the church of the living God." Upon the church of God has Christ bestowed every spiritual gift, every talent necessary for effec-tual service, every weapon needed for trium-phant warfare, every office needed for wise direction, all power necessary for the work assigned her. All these are given to her, and all that extra or intro church organizations can obtain must be drawn from the church. Officers, organizations, and machinery of men are multiplied, the church of Christ is weak-ened, and man obtains the glory. In fact, every addition of extra church societies or organizations means glory and honor to man, instead of God. It simply shows that Christ's professed followers are afraid to trust his Bumble ways, his almighty power, his simple though infinitely wise direction. "We" must (10 something; "we" must build; "we" must manage," is the carnal cry; and sadly history records, "we" fail. It is well written that the world by wisdom knows not God; neverthe-less,. "the fooliShness of God is wiser than men." "'THERE are in the Scriptures some things which are hard to be understood, and which, according to the language of Peter, the un-learned and unstable wrest unto their own destruction. We may not in this life be able to explain the meaning of every passage of Scripture; but there are no vital points of practical truth that will be clouded in mys-tery. When the time shall come, in the providence of God, for the world to be tested upon the truth for that time, minds will. be  exercised by his Spirit to search. the Scrip-tures, even with fasting and with prayer, until link after link is searched out and united in a perfect chain. Every fact which immedi, ately concerns the salvation of souls will be made so clear that none need err or walk in darkness."
