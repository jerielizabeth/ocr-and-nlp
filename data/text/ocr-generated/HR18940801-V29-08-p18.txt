 ulture..= THE EDUCATION OF ENVIRONMENT. BY MRS. E. E. KELLOGG. WITHIN the little babe, as the giant oak within the tiny acorn, lie enfolded all the possibilities of the future man or woman. No new faculties are added after birth. Aside from the influence of in-herited tendencies, what the future man or woman shall be must be determined by the development and education of the faculties with which he was endowed at birth ; even inherited tendencies may be more or less modified by training. Environment, Šthe conditions which surround the child and under which he develops,Š exerts a most powerful influence over the direction of his natural tendencies. The physical, mental, moral, and spirit-ual atmosphere which surrounds the child constitutes one of the strongest factors of his education. Fa-vorable environment promotes refinement, self-re-spect, and a general upward tendency even in adult life; how much more susceptible to its surround-ings must be the impressionable babe ? To develop the child to the utmost of its possibili-ties in a right direction it is necessary to be able to rightly control and regulate all surroundings which may affect his physical, mental, and spiritual wel-fare. Proper sanitary and hygienic conditions are of weighty import in this connection. Sir Edwin Chadwick, writing of the causes of drunkenness in London, says: "I have found that to a large extent the habits of drunkenness among the London poor are due to the conditions of filth by which they are surrounded, in default of the public service." Says another writer : "Place even the highest minded philosopher in the midst of unwhole-some surroundings, immorality, and vileness, and he will insensibily gravitate toward brutality." It is the duty of parents in selecting a home for their children to guard against a choice of location where the influence of their surroundings will have a  deteriorating effect either upon the physical or moral welfare of their children. It is exceedingly desirable that the home of the young child offer some advan-tages for freedom with nature ; that trees and flowers and green grass surround his home. It is a remark-able fact that most of the notable characters of the Bible spent their childhood in the country, where they could commune with nature and look from " nature up to nature's God." Another essential condition for the proper develop-ment of the child is his food and raiment, both of which should be simple in character and healthful, catering neither to a love of taste nor to vanity. All these environments give shape to his moral, mental, and physical nature. The environments, also, as to nurse, visitors, teachers, and others of the household with whom he comes in contact, should be most carefully looked to. Bad persons exert a far worse influence over a child than do bad books. A child will unconsciously grow to be like the character that associates with him. Then of what can a mother be thinking who delegates to an almost unknown hireling the care of her little child, for whom every look, every hand touch, every act, every word, every motive is forma-tive work? Says a recent writer, " Children are forced to bear the company of a nurse girl day in and day out, and really find their lives made by her, Š their eating, sleeping, and walking all done in her company. Their fathers and mothers could not bear such companionship for an hour. She may be vinegar to the teeth or smoke to the eyes, but the victims are helpless. They cannot tell whence their vague misery comes. They relieve it as children may ; they become habituated to it ; all the same they are stunted by it. They have not their own proper social atmosphere ; and there are children in ( 238 )
