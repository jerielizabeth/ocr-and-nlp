246 GOOD 1211SAMPPI. MILK FOR RHEUMATICS. AN important observation on dietetics was recently made in the London Lancet, by Dr. J. Milner Fothergill, of London., After remarking that persons afflicted with rheumatism or gout should carefully avoid nitrogenized articles of food, the doctor calls attention to the fact that this rule does not apply to milk, at least with the same force as to other albuminous articles of food. This he attributes to the fact that milk is chiefly digested in the small intestine by the action of the tryp-sine of the pancreatic juice; while meat is chiefly digested in the stomach by the pepsine of the gastric juice. It has been observed that the products of stomach digestion are more likely to produce uric acid than those of pancreatic digestion. Hence milk, peas, beans, and other foods containing albuminotis food elements sim-ilar in character, are proper foods for per-sons suffering with gout, rheumatism, and torpid liver. The constipating tendency of milk, which is not great, however, may be an-tagonized, when necessary, by the free use of fruits. Barn-Cellar Pork.ŠAn exchange rec-ommends fattening pork in the barn cel-lar during the winter. The writer claims that hogs kept in the barn cellar during the winter will increase in weight -from 40 lbs. in Oct. to 300 lbs. in May, and will keep the manure well trodden down. He does not say anything respecting the wholesomeness of manure-fattened pork, but this phase of the economic project is one which pork-lovers would do well to meditate upon. ŠGreat Britain has an infant insurance society, which must be related to what is known in this country as " graveyard " so-cieties, as the medical officer reports the death of one hundred and two children under five years in sixty-two families. In one family ten children died, all of whom were insured. ŠThe National Health Society of Eng-land has devised a mackintosh overgarment to be worn by persons attending patients sick with contagious maladies, and when used in conjunction with a cotton respi-rator, it is said to be a very perfect pro-tection from contagion. ŠThe lining membrane of the gizzard of the common fowl, dried and pulverized, is a favorite remedy for dyspepsia in China. It is also employed for the cure of ulcers, carious teeth, hemorrhoids, and many other diseased conditions. ŠA foreign physician reports the dis-covery that pure water warmed to a proper degree is equally successful with blood for the purpose of transfusion. Another phy-sician reports the same respecting a very weak solution of common salt. ŠA doctor has just found a use for rat-tle-snake poison. He recommends it as a sure cure for tetanus; but his report shows that although one of his patients recov-ered from the tetanus, he barely escaped death from the rattle-snake poison. ŠA Brazilian physician proposes to vaccinate against yellow fever. He has tried the experiment upon five human be-ings, after numerous experiments upon animals, but no results are yet reported. ŠAccording to the Lancet, the vapors of chloroform and ammonia are capable of preserving animal substances suspended in them. The addition of coal gas will preserve the color of blood. ŠAn international exhibition, in part devoted to health and education, will be held at South Kensington, London, some time during the present year. ŠA chemist reports the discovery of a method of making nicotine artificially ; so pretty soon we shall hear of artificial to-bacco and cigars.
