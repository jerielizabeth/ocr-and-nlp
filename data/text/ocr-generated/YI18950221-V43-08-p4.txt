7 ''74....`ŁŁ\ ° Ł ILL NFIEVITA E 60 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. FEBRUARY 21, 1805. THE SAINTS ARE GOD'S ISRAEL. " THE Lord hath chosen Zion. . . . I will also clothe her priests with salvation : and her saints shall shout aloud for joy." Ps. 132 : 13, 16. The apostle wrote " unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sancti-fied in Christ Jesus, called to be saints." 1 Cor. I :  2. Every one who calls on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in truth, and loves him, is one of the saints. It is the greatest honor God can bestow on a person to count him among the saints of God. " Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household." Phil. 4 :  21, 22. " Giv-ing thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light : who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son : in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins." Col. 1 : 12-1.4. We have no strength, but God can work mightily in the weak. He forgives our sins when we confess them, and he cleanses us from all unrighteousness, thus making us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Christ says, " Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de- , spitefully use you, and persecute you ; that ye may be the children of yotir Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." Matt. 5 44, 45. " And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God." Rom. 9 : 26. We were Gentiles and foreigners by birth, but God has in mercy called us in these last days, and placed us in his church, which is " the Israel of God." Then we glory only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified unto us, and we unto the world. God had anciently a believing people among the Jews. But they were not all Israel, which were of Israel. Rom. 9: 6. The great ma-jority hardened their hearts against God. They walkea not in his statutes, but polluted his Sabbaths. Eze. 20: 21. The devil (not Abraham) was their father, and they would do the lusts of their father. John 8 : 44. For this reason the Lord rejected them forever as a nation. The Lord spoke very definitively by Moses concerning their fate as a nation if they would not obey his commandments. " The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway." Deut. 28 :  33. Their land and city were taken and destroyed by the Romans. " Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed ; because thou harkenedst not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee." Verse 45. " And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed forever." Verse 46. For eighteen hundred years the Jews have been a sign and a wonder among the nations of the earth, and this they will continue to be till the Lord comes. THE TRUE ISRAEL'S FUTURE. THE Lord has given his Israel some very precious promises which are still unfulfilled. They cannot fail, but they do not belong to Israel after the flesh. God's holy promises do not belong to the children of the devil. God does not any longer recognize the old Israel as a separate people with separate promises and privileges. " For he [Christ] is our peace, who hath made both [Jews and Gen-tiles] one, arid hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us." Eph. 2 :  14. This middle wall of partition was the law of commandments contained in ordinances. The sacrificial temple service and circumcision dis-tinguished the Jews as a separate people. Christ took away the separating wall "for to make in himself of twain one new man, so mak-ing peace ; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross." Eph. 2 : 15, 16. Before the death of Christ the Gen- tiles "were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise." Verse 12. But now the believing Gentiles are fellow-citi-zens with the saints [the believing, that is, the spiritual Jews], and of the household of God." Verse 19. " For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh : but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men, but of God." Rom. 2 : 28, 29. Abraham is father of all them that believe, though they be not circum- cised, who live by faith in Christ. Chapter 4 : I I, 12. " For if they which are of the law [the unbelieving Jews] be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect." Verse 14. " Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham ; who is the father of us all (as it is written, I hive made thee a father of many nations)." Verses 16, 17. " For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children : but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God : but the children of the prom-ise are counted for the seed." Chapter 9 : 6-8. Those who believe in Christ, whether Jews or Gentiles, are God's Israel, Abraham's children, and to them pertain " the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the prom-ises." Verse 4. Through the fall of the Jews, salvation is come to the Gentiles ; and if their fall " be the riches of the world, and the di-minishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?" Chapter II : 12. What is the fulness of the Jews ? The ful-ness that God gives is an abundance of spir- itual blessings. It is " to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God." Eph. 3 : 19. " And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace." John r : 16. The apostle John who wrote this was himself a believing Israelite. He testified that God's Israel had then received their fulness, and that it was grace for grace, or grace in addition to grace. Christ himself, the heavenly Teacher,  taught them the truth of God, and brought the blessings of God to them ; and after his res-urrection the Holy Spirit was given in rich measure. Thus they received the early rain, - the fulness of the Jews,- while we look for the latter rain,- the fulness of the Gentiles. Rom. 11 : 25. And just as the Gentiles were blessed by the fulness of the Jews, so the Jews will be blessed in the last days through the fulness of the Gentiles. The words shall be in Rom. I r : 15 are added. If they are left out, the fifteenth verse teaches nothing more or less than the twelfth verse ; namely, that the cast-ing away of the Jews brought reconciliation to the world, and that their receiving, or fulness, was life from the dead. So likewise the ful- ness of the Gentiles will be life from the dead. " And so all Israel shall be saved." Rom. : 26. That is, in this manner shall all Israel be saved. The Greek word houto (which is rendered " so ") always refers to manner, not to time. Israel shall be saved in the manner spoken of so plainly in this chap-ter ; that is, by faith in Christ, whether they come from the Jews or from the Gentiles. There is but one good olive tree, but one true sheepfold ; and that is God's Israel. Verses 16-24 ; John 10 : 16. Jesus has made one sheepfold of believing Jews and Gentiles, and that is the one olive tree, or the house of Israel with whom the new covenant is made. Heb. 8 : 10-12. The unbelieving Jews are represented by branches that are broken off from the good olive tree. Rom. I : 17. They can be grafted in only by faith. Verse 23. And the believing Gentiles can remain as branches on the same olive tree (the spiritual house bf Israel) only by faith. Verse 22. Thus all stand by faith in Christ. And when the De- liverer comes from Zion, the people of God will obtain immortality. In this manner shall all Israel be saved when Christ is revealed in heavenly glory, with all his holy angels. May we then be ready. J. G. MATTESON. ALONE WITH CHRIST. AMONG the many hairbreadth escapes ex-perienced by the venerable missionary to the New Hebrides, Dr. Paton, the following is one of the most inspiring : - One night, pursued by savages, Dr. Paton was obliged to climb into a tree for safety. He says : " The hours I spent there live all before me, as if it were but yesterday. I heard the frequent discharging of muskets and the yell of the savages. Yet I sat there upon the branches as safe as in the arms of Jesus ! Never in all my sorrows did my Lord .draw nearer to me, and speak more soothingly to my soul than when the moonlight flickered among those chestnut leaves, and the night air played on my throbbing brow, as I told all my heart to Jesus. Alone, yet not alone ! If it be to glorify my God, I will not grudge to spend many nights alone in such a tree, to feel again my Saviour's spiritual presence, to enjoy his consoling friendship. If thus thrown back upon your own soul alone, all alone in the midnight in the bush, in the very embrace of death itself, have you a Friend that will not fail you then ? " TRAINING Up a child in the way we would have it go is not necessarily the same as train-ing it up in " the way it should go." - Ram's Horn. " TARRY ye." Many who are Christian workers would do better to be Christian waiters.- Govan.
