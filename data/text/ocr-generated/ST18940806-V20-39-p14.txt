ANDREW did just the same as every true disci-ple of Christ does who finds Christ to the joy of his heart,-began to preach the gospel. When men selfishly find treasures of earth, they wish to keep them to themselves. When men find the treasures of God in the gospel, they wish to share them with others. The first thought of Andrew was for his brother Simon, and he wished that Simon should share in the same blessed knowledge which had come to him, that of knowing the Messiah. The word "Messiah" means "anointed." The Greek form is "Christ." So, in speaking of Jesus as the Christ or the Messiah, it means the anointed of God, the One anointed of God to do just the work which Christ did, as stated in Luke 4 : 18 and Acts 10: 38. "Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone." "Cephas" was the Ara-maic for "stone," the modernized form of the Hebrew language. As the language would not be familiar, John tells us that by interpretation it is a stone. That in the Greek would be "petros," a piece of rock, detached from the living rock. In other words, "Cephas" is the Aramaic or Syriac for stone, while the Greek word, "petros," or "Peter," means the same thing. This, however, is not to be confounded with the word "Petra," referring to Jesus Christ. Peter was a stone;' Jesus was the Rock. 2. PHILIP the apostle is not to be confounded with Philip the deacon. Of his labors and death nothing is certainly known. Tradition says he preached the gospel in Phrygia and suffered martyr-dom. He was of the same town as Andrew and Peter. 3. Can there any good thing come oat of Naza-rethi-First, Nazareth was a small village of but lit-tle account. Second, it was not very far from Cana, which was Nathanael's own village, and much more important than Nazareth. Third, Nazareth is not even mentioned in the Old Testament, nor is there any prophecy concerning it, and it was a proverb that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. Fourth, all Galileans were despised for their want of culture, their rude dialect, etc. Fifth, Nazareth must have been in low repute for morality. Jesus himself was once driven away from it by a mob of its best citi-zens. These and other things were, doubtless, in Nathanael's mind when he asked the question, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" But we can see the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah, "He was a root out of a dry ground." God made the meanest things to praise him; and yet, after alb Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the city of David. si ≈Å Sir LESSON VII.-SABBATH, AUGUST 18, 1894. THE LOST FOUND.. Lesson Scripture, Luke 15: 1-32. 1. Now ALL the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him for to hear him. 2. And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, say-ing, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. 3. And he spake unto them this parable, saying, 4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them; doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 5. And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. 7. I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, which need no repentance. 8. Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it? 9. And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. 10. Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. 11. And he said, A certain man had two sons; 12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. 15. And not many days after the younger son gathered all to- gether, and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. 14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 15. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 16. And he would fain have been filled with the husks that the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him. 17. But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger ! 18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight; 19. I am no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants. 20. And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off his father saw him, and was moved with compas-sion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 21. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight; I am no more worthy to be called thy son. 22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; 23. And bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry; 24. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. 25. Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. 26. And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be. 27. And be said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father bath killed the fatted calf, because he bath received him safe and sound. 28. But he was angry, and would not go in; and his father came out, and entreated him. 29. But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a command-ment of thine; and yet thou never gayest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. 30. But when this thy son came, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf. 31. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine. 32. But it was meet to make merry and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. THERE is but one subject treated in this chapter, and that is indicated in the title of the lesson. Bu t it is considered under three heads, namely, "The Lost Sheep," "The Lost Piece of Money," and "The Prodigal Son." These are all familiar stories. See how minutely you can relate them. 1. Who drew near to Jesus? 2. In what words did the scribes and Pharisees murmur against him? 3. What did this call forth from Jesus ? 4. Relate the first parable. 5. How long does the man in the parable seek the lost sheep? 6. How does he feel when he finds it? 7. What does he do when lie reaches home? 8. What lesson did Jesus teach from this? 9. What was the second parable? 10. What does the woman do when she has lost the piece of silver? 11. What when she finds it? 12. What lesson does Jesus teach from this? 13. Relate the third parable. 14. What did the younger of the two sons receive from his father? 15. What did he do with it? 16. How reduced were his circumstances ? 17. What took place then? 18. When he came to himself, what did he say? 19. What did he do? 20. What took place when "he was yet a great way off" ? .; 21. Did his father accept him as a servant? 22. How did he treat him ? 23. What was the general feeling over the returned son? 24. How did the elder son feel? 25. What was the father's reply? NOTES. 1. "Tins man receiveth sinners." That which the Pharisees uttered as a reproach against Jesus, is his greatest glory. It is a glory to him, and he glo-ries in it. He is not ashamed to receive sinners. "He is not ashamed to call them brethren." Heb. 2: 11. "Behold what maner of love the Father bath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." He receives us when we offer ourselves to him as servants, and makes us sons. "Henceforth I call you not servants; . . . but I have called you friends.." John 15 : 15. "Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ." Gal. 4 : 7. 2. ``THERE is joy in the presence of the angels over  one sinner that repenteth." If you are not very watchful, you will find yourself reading according to the common way, "There is joy among the angels over one sinner that repenteth." This is doubtless true, but it is not what the text says. "There is  joy in the presence of the angels of God." This includes the other thought, and adds infinitely more to it. God himself is not ashamed to exhibit in the pres-ence of the angels his great joy over one repentant sinner. What more could be said to encourage poor wanderers? It is not that God will not cast off the repentant one, but that he is overflowing with joy at his return. He cannot and does not attempt to conceal his great joy when even one sinner repents. He watches for him and rushes to meet him when he is yet a long way off. "For the love of God is broader Than the measure of man's mind; And the heart of the Eternal Is most wonderfully kind." 3. IN studying the parable of the prodigal son, do not lose the preciousness of it by allowing your mind to run off into speculation as to who are indi-cated by the two sons. Whoever you are, the para-ble means you. Granted that the hard elder brother represents the position of the Pharisees toward the publicans and Gentiles, we must still remember that the race of the Pharisees is not yet extinct. We are either the prodigal son returning to the Father's house, or else we are the carping elder brother. And the worst of the second case is that we are actually in as hard circumstances as the prodigal, and uncon-scious of it. See Rev. 3 : 17. Let us be content in studying this chapter to feast upon the revelation of the wonderful love of God, that we may be the more closely drawn to him. Let this word concern-ing Christ be ever in our minds, "This Man receiv-eth sinners." 1 ONCORDINE TO THE Bill i B  Contains everyYR RWO  word rEd inT Y alphabetical  0 t CNG. ,  L  L. L.

Part first, 25.n ZEtonement Consistent with Reason. In this he shows that the doctrine of an atonement through the medium of a voluntary substitute is consis-tent with reason. Part second, The Zittonement as Revealed in the Bible. In this is discussed the plan of redemption through Christ, by which every sinner who accepts Christ will be justified; sin will be turned back upon the head of its originator; the earth will be cleansed from the curse; God's righteous government will be restored over the en-tire universe; and all who will not become loyal subjects of that government will be destroyed.
