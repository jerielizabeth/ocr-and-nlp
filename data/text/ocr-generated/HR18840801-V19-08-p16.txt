240 GOOD pm/km-rm.        HOW BILLY TOOK HIS LAGER. "BOY BILLY " was the adopted son of Christian Zende, an honest German, who was much shocked one day at seeing the boy in a lager-beer saloon, tossing off a foaming glass of beer. He bade the boy go home, but said nothing till evening. After tea, Zende seated himself at the ta-ble, and placed before him a variety of queer things. Billy looked on with curi-osity. " Come here, Billy," said Christain Zende. " Why were you in the beer-shop to-day? Why do you drink beer, my boy ? " " 0-0--because it's good," said Billy boldly. " No, Billy, it is not good to the mouth. I did never see so big faces as you did make. Billy, you think it will taste good by and by, and it looks like a man to drink, and so you drink. Now, Billy, if it is good, have it. I will not hinder you from what is good and manly, but drink it at home, take your drink pure, and let me pay for it. Come, my boy! You like beer. Well, open your mouth. I have all the beer stuffs, pure from the shops. Come, open your mouth, and I will put it in." Billy drew near, but kept his mouth close shut. Said Zende, " Do n't you make me mad, Billy. Open your mouth." Thus .exhorted, Billy opened his mouth, and Zende put a small bit of alum in it. Billy drew up his face. A bit of aloes followed. This was worse. Billy winced. The least morsel of red pepper now, from a knife point, made Billy howl. " What, not like beer !" said Zende. " Open your mouth." A knife dipped in oil of turpentine made Billy cry. " Open your mouth ; the beer is not half made yet." And Billy's tongue got the least dust-ing of lime, and potash, and saleratus. Billy now cried loudly. Then came a grain of licorice, hop pollen, and saltpetre. " Look, Billy! Here is some arsenic and some strychnine ; these belong to beer. Open your mouth!" " I can't, I can't," roared Billy. "Ar-senic and strychnine are to kill rats ! I shall die! 0-0-0Šdo you want to kill me, Father Zende?" " Kill him just by a little beer, all good and pure ! He tells me he likes beer, and it is manly t') drink it, and when I give him some, he cries I kill him. Here is water. There is much water in beer." Billy drank the water eagerly. Zende went on. " There is much alcohol in beer. Here ! open your mouth," and he dropped four drops of raw spirit carefully on his tongue. Billy went dancing around the room, and then ran for more water. " Come here, the beer is not done, Billy," aT d seizing him, he put the cork of an ammonia bottle to his lips, then a drop of honey, a taste of sugar, a drop of molasses, a drop of gall. " There, Billy! here is jalap, copperas, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, and nux vomica. Open your mouth." "Oh, no, no!" said Billy, "let me go. I hate beer. I'll never drink any more I'll never go in that shop again. Oh, let me go ! I can't eat those things. My mouth tastes awful now. Oh, take them away, Father Zende !" " Take them away! Take away good beer, when I have paid for it? My boy, you drank them fast to-day." " Oh, they make me sick," said Billy. "A man drinks all these bad things mixed up in water. He gets red in the face, he gets big in his body, he gets shaky in his hands, he gets weak in his eyes, he gets mean in his manners." Billy was satisfied on the beer question. ŠFrom the German. ŠA loyalty to God ennobles every duty. If those who complain of the pettiness of life were raised to higher positions, even to the ruling of kingdoms, they would find the duties equally irksome and monoto-nous. The great of this world have troub-les and afflictions the same as the poorest, and all are equally honored of God accord-ing as they fill the place assigned them. Each should seek this place, and fill it in a manner suitable for time and eternity. People should not demean their own occu-pations, and look enviously at the condition or success of others. God makes no such distinctions. The real success of life is open to all. As has been said, "Knowl-edge is the bill which few can hope to climb ; duty is the path which all may tread."ŠSel. ŠWhen you have a mind to advise with any one concerning your private affairs, examine well first how he has managed bis own; for he that has been faulty in the administration of his own concerns, will never be able to advise well with reference to those of others.
