LITERARY NOTICES. LAST year The Bancroft Company established themselves in the Auditorium building, Chicago, for the express purpose of producing in print and pictures, the best work on the great Columbian Ex-position. They sent East and to Europe for the best artists, and set up an entire plant for drawing, photographing, and engraving. Being in the field long before the Exposition opened, they prepared in every way to paint this wonderful panorama true to life. In many respects THE BOOK OF THE FAIR, by Hubert Howe Bancroft, has no competitor, and can have none. To enter into details regarding its plan is obvi-ously impossible. Not only have the buildings and the exhibits of the Exposition departments their special curios and educational attractions, but the commonwealths of the United States and the foreign countries present miniature worlds in themselves. All are reproduced true to life. There are also scores of unclassified features, such as those grouped and massed along the Midway Plaisance. Then again, are presented the intellectual and religious traits of all nations, such as center around the World's Congress Auxiliary. To clearly place this vast panorama before the public is a work worthy of the highest ambition ; but the Bancroft Company is accustomed to great enterprises and to carrying them to a suceessful issue. " ITALIAN GARDENS. "Å  By Charles A. Platt. With a colored frontispiece (printed in Paris) and many illustrations. 4to, cloth, ornamental, uncut edges, and gilt top, $5. (In a box.) Harper and Brothers, New York. Mr. Platt's book is the result of a careful study of some of the most perfect examples of landscape-gardening in Southern Europe, and it is illustrated with numerous beautiful views of famous gardens in the'neighborhood of Rome and Florence, including a colored frontispiece. The volume will be much sought after, both on account of its artistic beauty and for its variety of practical suggestions. ONE woman's most unique experience of life for a year in a Michigan lumber camp is most charmingly told in an exceedingly interesting article, " In and about a Lumber Camp," published in the August number of Denzorest's Family Magazine ; and after reading her vivid description of the life of the lum-bermen and the modus operandi of " logging," illus-trated with superb half-tone pictures, one feels thoroughly posted about this picturesque though  laborious industry. But not every lumber camp is blessed with the ministrations of a trained nurse. Under the apt title " Golden Silence" a pathetic story of a deaf mute is told, and incidentally one may learn the method by which these unfortunates communicate with their fellow beings. " How to Read and Write in Cipher" will furnish entertain-ment for many a summer or winter evening. " The Flower Garden in August" furnishes many excellent suggestions for the care of flowers in midsummer ; and an especially timely paper entitled " Visiting the Sick " should be read by every one. THE complete novel in the August number of Li:ppincott's is "Sweetheart Manette," by'Vlaurice Thompson. Louise Stockton's tale, " A Mess of Pottage," is concluded. Other short stories are " At the Rough-and-Tumble Landing," by Prof. Charles G. D. Roberts ; " A Military Manceuvre," by Kate Lee Ashley ; " The Everlastin' Buzzards' Sit," by Charles Mc Ilvaine ; and " An In Memoriam of the Keys," by Johanna Staats. Thomas Stinson Jarvis contributes an acute and suggestive essay on "Femi-nine Phases," and Charles Henry Webb discusses " Uncared-for Cats " in a humanely humorous vein. Mrs. M. E. W. Sherwood supplies interesting remi-niscences of " Washington Before the War." Mary Elisabeth Blake writes on " Muscles and Morals," George Grantham Bain on " Newspaper 'Faking,'" and Will Clemens on "Chinese Shops " and their peculiar signs. The poetry of the number is by Margaret Gilman George, Dora Read Goodale, Fannie Bent Dillingham, and Professor John B. Tabb. Scribner's Magazine for August is a fiction num-ber, as has been the custom for seven years. It contains six complete short stories, all of which are distinguished by an individuality and a delicate fancy that make them of unusual quality, even for the high standard of short fiction in American magazines. A literary feature of great interest is a batch of letters from James Russell Lowell to Edgar A. Poe, written when the former was about twenty-five years of age, and was editing the Pioneer. These letters were orignally in the possession of Dr. R. W. Griswold, and recently came, through his executor, into the hands of his son, W. M. Griswold, of Cambridge, Mass. Prof. George E. Woodberry, the biographer of Poe, furnishes an introduction and notes. The number contains only one poem, a ballad by C. G. D. Roberts, with four very graceful illustra-tions by Kaemmerer. ( 256 )
