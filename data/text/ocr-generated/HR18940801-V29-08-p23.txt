HOME CULTURE. 243 SOME QUICKLY PREPARED PIES. 4 SOME one has estimated that in the average home where pie is considered an essential of everyday diet, no more to be dispensed with than the meal itself, the hou.sewife spends at least one-third of her work-ing hours in its preparation. And the result of this labor, while requiring 'such an outlay of time and strength, is far too apt to be of a character neither conducive to good health nor wholesome living. We believe it possible to live well and leave pie entirely off the daily bill of fare ; but if from long custom it is sometimes considered desirable, we would suggest the use, in place of the ordinary article, of one of the following quickly prepared and simple pie recipes, which approach more nearly the hygienic standard than any others with which we are acquainted : Š Quickly Prepared Pie Crust.Š For one pie take two-thirds of a cup of granola (manufactured by the Sanitarium Food Co.), moisten with an equal quan-tity of thin cream or rich milk, and let it stand a few minutes ; place the moistened mass in the center of the pie tin, and with a spoon spread it evenly and thinly over the bottom and around the sides of the tin, leaving no holes. Fill with any one of the differ-ent prepared fillings given, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. To form the edge nicely, rest the length of the first finger of the left hand against the edge of the tin, and press the material against it. The shaping of the crust will require but a few moments, and should be done at once as soon as the granola is well moistened, as it absorbs the liquid and soon becomes dry again. Prune Filling for Pie. Š Cook sweet California prunes (which have been well washed and cleaned) in three parts water to one of prunes, slowly for several hours. When well done, rub through a colander to remove the skins and stones. If the pulp when thus  prepared is too thin, place in a covered earthen dish and set on the stove to remain until the liquid has evaporated sufficiently to leave the pulp of about the consistency of thin marmalade. Fill the crust with the prune pulp, and bake. No sugar will be needed with the sweet prunes. Sour prunes sweetened may be used if preferred. A meringue may be added, if desired. Dried Apple Filling. ŠStew dried apples nicely ; when done, rub through a colander, evaporate to the proper consistency, add sugar to taste, and use the same as the prune marmalade. Dried peaches may be utilized in the same manner, also fresh green apples. Custard Filling.ŠTake one pint of milk, one well-beaten egg, a tablespoonful of cornstarch, one-third of a cup of sugar, and a little grated lemon rind for flavoring. Heat the milk to scalding, stir in the cornstarch, and cook until thickened ; cool, and then add the egg well beaten. Turn into a granola crust and bake. Lemon Filling.Š'Take four tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, the grated yellow portion only of the rind of half a lemon, and two-thirds of a cup of sugar. Beat the lemon juice and the sugar together. Braid a slightly heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch with as little water as possible and pour over it, stirring constantly, one-half pint of boiling water, to thicken the starch. Add the lemon and sugar to the starch, and let it cool ; then stir in the yolks of two eggs and half the white of one well beaten together. Beat thoroughly, pour into the crust and bake. Berry Filling.Š Stew the fruit, sweeten, and thicken with a little cornstarch or flour ; or the fresh fruit may be introduced into a cup or more of water in which has been cooked a rounding spoonful of sago or manica. E. E. K. If IF you are compelled to keep flour in a barrel that must be moved whenever the floor is cleaned, make a small platform with a castor at each corner to stand it on. If you have no good cover for the barrel, take off the upper hoop, fasten it securely to-gether, and put a cover of double unbleached muslin over the top and sew it around the hoop.Š Sel. MENDING TABLE LINEN.--,  Embroidery cotton is the best material for mending table linen. Select a number of the cotton which will correspond with the  quality of the linen to be mended. Under the ragged edges of the tear, baste a piece of stiff paper, and make a network of fine stitches back and forth over its edges, carrying the stitches about an inch beyond the tear. Thin places and breaks in linen may be run with flax or embroidery floss, and towels should be mended in the same way. ON fabrics that will not be injured by it, soft soap will take out paint stains much better than benzine, chloroform, and similar cleaners.
