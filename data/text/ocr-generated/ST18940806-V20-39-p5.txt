August 6, 1894. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. PI 613 Christ, and is called his child, must experience a birth. The life that is produced thereby is just as real as is the life following the natural birth. This birth of which we speak is commonly known as the new birth, and, as expressed in the Scriptures, is from above: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." John 3 : 6. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three great agencies in creation and re-demption, and are all represented as from above. The flesh is used to represent the outward form of human nature, and its sin-ful condition. The natural birth, which is of the flesh, brings with it the inherent weak-ness of the parents, which is the door through which Satan enters to bind the soul, that its life may be under his control. The new birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. "Born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1 : 23. Before this the individual was as one dead, having no more consciousness and expe-rience of spiritual life than an unborn infant of the life of its parents. He was "dead in trespasses and sins." A Necessity. The corruption of human .nature demands just such a change as the new birth will produce. Man's natural birth, whatever his station in life, brings no good thing with it. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." But what is in the flesh? "I know that in me (that is, in my flesh), dwelleth no good thing." Rom. 7 :18. "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For the mind of the'flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be." Rom. 8 : 5-7, Re-vised Version. There is no power in time flesh to produce life, for there is no life in it. Itcan-not give what it does not possess, and it con-tains no good thing. "Wherein aforeti me ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the Spirit that now worked' in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest." Eph. 2: 2, 3, Revised Version. There is no Ł power over death in the life of the natural man, for his life is only death it-self. Sin is natural to his heart. "From within, out of the heart of man, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adul-teries, covetings, wicked mmess, deceit,lascivious-ness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness; all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man." Mark 7 : 21-23, Revised Ver-sion. But the heart is represented as the center of life. "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." Prov. 4: 23. The issues of life are from the heart, and the unregenerate heart is filled with sin, which is death, therefore the very life of man is so poi-soned that it is only a living death. It can-not be wondered that the convicted and pen-itent soul should cry, "0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of this death ?" Rom. 7 : 24, margin. This being man's condition, he is certainly in need of help which lie himself does not possess.  His heart being evil, and thoroughly leav-ened with death, every pulsation is only one more stroke towards the destruction that awaits him. "A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the' evil treasure bringeth forth evil things." Matt. 12 : 35. Then a man that has only evil in his heart cannot bring forth good things. But life is one of the good things that God desires man to have. John 3: 16.,  The fleshly .mind cannot re-ceive* it, for it is enmity toward God. It is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be: 'The laW of God is spiritual (Rom. 7:12), and can only be written in a spirit-ual mind and heart. Since man is naturally evil, and his heart and mind bring forth only evil, there must be an entire transformation of character before he is fit to dwell with God, or to have Christ dwell with him. To such Jesus speaks, as he spoke to Nicodernus: "Except a man be born again [margin, "from above"] he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3 :3. This change does not cornefrom man, nor by man. It is from God. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Jer. 13: 23. Who ever heard of a black man changing the color of his skin? Such a thing would be called a miracle; and such it would be, for it is con-trary to all .natural law. Until we hear of such a circumstance, we need not expect to hear of a sinner changing his life. It requires a power that can make a dead man live to perform this change. As nothing of which we can form conception can take the place of a birth as a way into physical life, so nothing within the whole sphere of spiritual timings can take the place of the new birth, as a door of entrance into the life of grace. As we be-came partakers of -Adam's nature, and death reigned in us (Rom. 5 :12, 17), so we must become partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1 :4), that the life of Christ may reign in us. Scripture Figures. The Scriptures were given to man for in-struction, for profit, that ire may be wise unto salvation. See 2 Tim. 3: 17. The Lord does not want us to put our trust in. man's wis-dom or learning for our salvation. Time gospel is the "power of God unto salvation." Rom. 1: 15. So the Lord makes the gospel so sim-ple that man can understand if he will but read. We say that a teacher is an excellent instructor who simplifies his instruction by the use of familiar terms, already understood by time student. This is time way the Lord has given his instruction to man. It is his will that all should be saved, and become partakers of eternal life. To this end he uses different expressions to show how man may enter this spiritual life. In one place we read, "Except a man be bOrn again;" in another, "Except ye be converted, and be-come as little children ;" while in another, "Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." All these expressions refer to time change that is necessary in order to become Christ's. In other places we read: "A. new heart also will I give you;" "Being justified by faith we have peace with God;" he saved us by "the washing of regeneration', and renew-ing of the Holy Ghost." Yet in another place the Scriptures saith: "Wherefore. come out from among them, and be ye separate;  saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean  thing; and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith time Lord Almighty." All these scriptures lead Man in time same direc-tion, i. e., from sin to righteousness. Some of them speak more particularly of-  man's part, while others speak of what God does. The term "conversion" means, literally, "a turning one's self around, or towards; a turn-ing about." But man has no power in him-self to turn round. He must be moved by the Spirit of God. He can will to turn from sin, but without the power of God he will never accomplish what lie wills. To justify is to set forth as righteous, to free a man from his guilt, which stands in his way of being right. Man may will to turn from hiS sinful life, but that alone does not change his past life. Had he the power to do right when he desires to turn from sin, he could not change his past record. ŁSo we see man needs some-thing more than to turn. He needs his past life declared what it has not been, viz., right-eous. Who can do this? Not the sinner. "To him that worked) not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." Rom. 4 :5. Man's heart is represented as a fountain of evil. It is not partly good and partly evil. This cannot be. A fountain cannot send forth both bitter and sweet water at the same time. As soon as the bitter water begins to flow, the whole stream becomes bitter._ You will have no success cleansing the stream as long as time bitter water is mixing with time sweet. The fountain head mustŁbe changed. This is what God wants to do for us. He wants to create within us a new heart, the issues of which will be a fountain of -living water. "If any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature." 2 Cor. 5: 17, margin. Here is an-other expression used that represents.  God's power to time sinner who will turn to him. Time word "regeneration" is closely connected with the new creation, for-it means, literally, to "create back again:" This would be to put man back again where he was when he was first created. When we speak of time earth being renewed, we understand that time sin in it will be destroyed, and the curse removed from it. So, when man is regenerated, sin must be moved from him, and he be innocent before his Maker. The Saviour said to Nicodemus, "Except a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3 : 3, margin. "Born again" is an expression whose literal mean-ing is "to bear again; a new beginning of personal life." It means all that conversion and justification can mean, and possibly more than either of them alone. Man con-verts when he turns to God. He is justified when God declares him righteous. But jus-tification in itself can only deal with past sins. "Being justified freely by his grace through time redemption that is in Christ, Jesus; whOm God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remissions of sins that are past." Rom. 3: 24, 25. The sinner needs to turn from more than time sins of the past. He needs more than righteousness imputed for past sins. He needs a new life. Our Righteousness. Righteousness is the doing, or being, what is. just and right. The least deviation from this is unrighteousness, which is sin. But time wages of sin is death; so every upright-
