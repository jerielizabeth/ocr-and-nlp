Here it is: "And God more doubt that the coming of the Lord is saw that the wickedness of man was great in near, than there is that the stars fell in 1833. the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." Gen. 6 : 5. Here is total depravity. If' it bad been otherwise the Lord would not have de-stroyed the people of that time. When the Lord comes it is to destroy the inhabitants of the earth. (The righteons are simply sojourn-ers, and not dwellers.) But he would not de-stroy them unless they were incorrigibly wicked. We are therefore not to expect any great ref-ormation before the coming of the Lord, or general preparation for that event. Yet the warning is to be given just as faithfully, and people are to be just as earnestly exhorted to repent, as though all were expected to reform. All must hear. "This gospel of the kingdom" must be preached in all the world fbr a  witness. The world has not yet arrived at that state of wickedness described by our Saviour. It is the faithful preaching of the word that will call out the few that will turn to God, and harden the others in their rebellion. The preaching of truth always causes a division. Luke 12 : 52, 53. And when the word shall have been preached in all the world, separating men into the two classes, "then shall the end come." It is for this alone that the coming of the Lord now waits. E. J. W. 1.

Mark 13 :37. 24. While waiting and watching what else must we do? Luke 21 :36. THERE aro some things that all men may know. There are others which are concealed. concerning which it is useless for man to in-quire. It is written: "The secret things be-long unto the Lord our God; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever." Deut. 29 : 29. This is per-fectly reasonable. if the Lord has revealed anything, it is most certainly for our benefit. Whenever, therefore, we find definite state-ments in the Bible concerning any event, we may speak of that event with the utmost pos-itiveness, to the extent that the statements are made. Now' let us apply this to the subject of the Lord's coming. We know, (1) That the fiord will ,come again. We have his own word tbr that. (2) That his second coming will be as literal as his first,-" this same Jesus,"-and that it will be so glorious, and accompanied with such manifestations that no one can be ignorant of it. Matt. 24 : 27; Rev. 1 : 7; 1 Thess. 4: 16, 17. (3) That before his coming certain signs will take place. (4) That these signs, as recorded in Matt. 24, and learned in our last lesson, are the darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars. (5) That these signs have actually taken place in the exact manner foretold by our Saviour. We do not obtain our knowledge of any of the above things by any propess of reasoning, but by plain statements of fact. There is yet one thing more that we may know, that we are commanded to know. The Lord, after having informed the disciples of the signs above-men-tioned, said: " When ye shall see all these things, know that it [margin, he, that is, Christ] is near. oven at the doors." Matt. 24 : 33. We are to know it just as certainly as we know that summer is near when the leaves begin to ap- " VERILY I say unto you, This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled." Matt. 24 : 34. There need be no difficulty in understanding this verse. He certainly did not mean to say that his coming would take place before the close of the generation then living, for that would be a contradiction of his own words in verses 4-8, and is directly con-tradicted by Paul in 2 Thess. 2 : 1-8. More-over, whoever claims that Christ did mean that he would come before that generation should pass, must also claim that the dead have been raised and the living translated. 1 Thess. 4: 16, 17. The fact that Christ has nut yet come is sufficient proof' that be did not predict an immediate coming. Then what did he mean? This can be answered by finding out of what time he was speaking. It was not of the time then present, for he was looking for-ward. He had spoken of the destruction of Jerusalem; he had described the 1260 years of papal supremacy, with its disastrous results to the people of God; and he had minutely described the signs that were to follow, the last of which took place, as we have seen, in 1833. Looking at that time, he said, "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled." What things? The things recorded in verse 31. A similar use of the expression "this generation" is found in Ps. 95 : 10. There are hundreds of persons now alive who witnessed the falling of the stars in 1833. Does anybody doubt that sonie of that generation will be alive when the fiord comes? Hear what the Saviour says: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." Matt. 24 : 35. " BuT of that day and hour knoweth no man." Here is one of the secret things that belong to God alone. The exact time has not been revealed; therefore we have nothing to do with it; it does not concern us. Yet our ignorance of the exact time does not in the least affect our knowledge of what is revealed, nŁimely, that his coming is near. The farmer knows when summer is near, yet he cannot tell the day when it will be fairly open. We often speak of a friend as coining very soon, yet we do not know the exact time of his com-ing. After Christ has given us such unmistak-able evidences of the nearness of his coming, it is not only foolish but wicked to pay no atten-tion to them, simply because he has not re-vealed to us the day and hour. THE fact that comparatively few even of re-ligious people believe in and teach the doctrine of the near coming of the Lord, is sometimes urged as proof' that the doctrine cannot be true. if no one believed it, that would not invalidate the Scripture record in the least; the Scripture cannot be broken by the unbelief of men. But the fact that but few are looking for the Lord's coming is one of the signs by which we may know that we are in the last days. Paul says that in the last days perilous times will come, because men shall be lovers of their own selves. 2 Tim. 3 : 1. Then he gives a list of special sins of which they will be guilty, and to show that he does not refer to the non-pro-fessing world, he says, "Having a form of god-liness, but denying the power thereof." "They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him." Titus 1 : 16. And this is in the last days. MOREOVER, our Saviour himself has given a description of the time immediately preceding his coming. He said: "And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man." Luke 17 : 26. To find, then, what will be a characteristic of the last days, we have only to read a description of the time NOTES ON THE INTERNATIONAL LESSON. AUGUST 24-2 Sem. 24 : 14-25. ABOUT six years after the death of Absalom, and the scenes described in the last lesson, Da-vid was tempted to number the people. In 1 Chron. 21 : 1 it is said that Satan stood up and provoked him to do it. That it was a wrong move, even Joab and the captains were aware, and remonstrated with the king, but to no pur-pose. After the work had been completed, however, David's heart smote him, and he made humble confession before the Lord and sought forgiveness. So the Lord gave him choice of three modes of punishment-seven years of famine, to flee three months before his enemies, or to have three days' pestilence in the land. David was in a great strait, but he chose to fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great." WE have here an evidence that direct per-sonal reproof is often necessary to guide men in the path of duty, and that the greatest kind-ness, that can be shown a man is to acquaint him with his faults. It would appear that Da-vid, notwithstanding the remonstrance of his officers, was not fully sensible of the magnitude of his offense until reproved by his seer, the prophet Gad; and having found that be could muster thirteen hundred thousand men of war, there is no telling what rash measure his ambi-tion' might have prompted him to undertake. This is the second time be was checked in a downward career by timely warning from the Lord. And be it said to his credit, he bowed with becoming humility to the penalties affixed to his crimes. He realized the mercy of God, and pre-ferred to fall into his hands, though grievously offended, rather than into the hands of an en-emy. His experience was that "Like as a fa-ther pitieth his children, so the Lord pities them that fear him." THE character of the pestilence shows the submission of David to a punishment that might include himself. As Dr. Clarke says: " Had he chosen war, his own personal safety would have been in no danger, because there was already an ordinance forbidding him going to battle. Had he chosen famine, his own wealth would have secured his and his family's support; but he showed the greatness of his mind in choosing the pestilence, to the rav-ages of which- himself and household were ex-posed equally with the meanest of his subjects."
