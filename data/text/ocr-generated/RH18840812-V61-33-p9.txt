AUG 12, 1884j THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 521 COLLEGE PROSPECTS. WE have not personally written anything for the REVIEW concerning our College for many months. We have been absent from it, and others have spoken in its behalf. But let none suppose our interest for it has flagged ; it was never greater. The results last year were truly encouraging. Over one hundred of those who attended it are now laboring in the work as teachers, ministers, colporters, canvassers, tent-masters, or workers in our institutions. From what other source have . we received such a reinforcement of laborers 1 We firmly believe that our educational institutions are our great hope, our principal reliance for increasing our force of workers in this cause. Therefore they should be cherished by us as objects of the great-est importance. If we can keep them where God can bless them, we shall find them of the greatest value. Never has there been a year in the past when such favorable results have been shown ; and yet we expect to see much greater results in the future. We look forward to the coming year with much solicitude. From inquiries made where we have attended our camp-meetings this season, we judge there will be a much larger attendance than last year, and it would not surprise us if it con-siderably exceeded any previous year. We hope all who desire to be useful, and are willing to con-form to the discipline of the College, and need its benefits, will come. All others we hope will stay away. We are more anxious that the right stand-ard shall be maintained than to have a large at-tendance. We are deeply interested in the new feature which is to be tried the coming Col-lege year,Šthe introduction of manual labor in connection with moral and intellectual culture. This will be a new departure of great importance and special interest. It will be carrying out the light which God has given us, and it will be in harmony with the most advanced thought on the subject of education. The experiment is being tried already in many places, and we have yet to learn of a single instance where the step has been regretted. In many instances, the results have been most satisfactory. Why should it not be so ? Man has a threefold nature : moral, intellectual, and physical. In the present system of education most commonly practiced, only the intellectual is cultivated, and sad results are often seen. Per-sons of much intelligence are morally rotten. Prin-ciple is lacking everywhere. Physical results of a disastrous character also prevail. Thousands lose their health while attending college and are inva-lids for life, and many die. Had. they properly cared for the physical system, they might have re-tained good health, and have been useful through a long life. When the physical nature is neglected, then the mental one also suffers. Man should be properly developed in all parts of his God-given nature. When this is properly done, he will be well balanced, and every function will act its proper part. He Ł will have a strong mind in a strong body. We are thankful that there is a good pros-pect that we are to have a school where the moral, mental, and physical are all to have their proper attention. Difficulties, no doubt, we shall meet, but we seem nearer to this result than ever before. The College Board has determined to make the effiart the coming school year, to do their best to carry out these principles as well as they can. They have not all the facilities they could desire. While the Educational Society at the last annual meeting advised this step, our people have not fur-nished the Board with funds to erect the proper buildings and provide the necessary facilities needed ; yet we will do the best we can with the helps at our disposal. The Catalogue, now about completed, will ''inform those interested in the steps contemplated. Last Monday night, Aug. 5, a meeting was held at the Tabernacle, in which these things were considered. Remarks were made by Eld. Littlejohn, Dr. Kellogg, afid the writer, relative to the school and the proposed plan, and the results already attained. The remarks of the Doctor, concerning the importance of physical cul-ture were of deep interest to those present. We believe the better portion of the church will heart-ily second these efforts, and that they will result in success. If useful trades are learned in connec-tion with the cultivation of the mind, what an ad-vantage it will be to all who avail themselves of the privilege. If our'daughters, at the same time they learn to cypher, learn grammar, music, etc., could also learn to make good bread, and cook in a wholesome manner, make their own bonnets and hats, and cut and make their dresses, etc., and learn the economy of the household, would it not be an improvement upon the present system I The same would be true of our boys learning things suitable to their sex. We shall hope for greater success in our College than ever before. We believe our people will work to sustain it, and will yet feel that it is one of the most important institutions in our midst. Let our ministers everywhere use their influence to induce such as can be benefited, those who have some sense of the importance of education, and are moral and worthy, to come to our College the coming year. We do not want the lawless, the rebellious, the hard cases whom the parents cannot manage. Our school is not a "Reform School " ; we want to help those who can be helped and be made use-ful. There are some who are in poor circum-stances who need assistance. Let those who know them best render that assistance.. The College is too poor to be able to help such pecuniarily. It ran behind more than $2,000 last year. Let our people help the College with patronage and means. G. 1. B. HOW GOES THE CANVASSING? THE progress of the canvassing work among Seventh-day Adventists during the year past has been gratifying. It was a very hard work to start, but it has been started at last. It has been demonstrated beyond all question that canvassing is a successful method of introducing the present truth to our fellow-men. We gladly welcome every honorable way of bringing the important truths of God's word to the attention of the peo-ple. This is our business, our greatest and most important duty. Many thousands of copies of that most excellent work, " Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation," have thus been brought be-fore honest and inquiring minds. Many thou-sands of pages of other excellent matter= have also been circulated this way. And the work has but just begun. Little has been said concerning this of late. But we are glad to say that many vol-umes are being sold, and that the work is increas-ing, and is bound to increase. Many have started in the canvassing business, and have failed to accomplish much. Many of these did not stick to it with perseverance and earnestness. But some did, and such have suc-ceeded. Some have bad brilliant success. There have been instances where as many as eight vol-umes of " Thoughts " were sold in an hour. Of course these cases are wholly exceptional ones. Towns have been canvassed, and as many as 130 volumes of "Thoughts" sold in one city in the space of three or four weeks. One brother sold 72 " Thoughts " and 108 " Sunshine at Home " in three or four weeks on territory which had once been canvassed over some two years ago for " Thoughts." It was naturally supposed that this previous effort would make it harder to sell them there again. But it was found out by trial that it had made the second canvass easier. Those parties which had purchased before were glad to see the same agent again. They felt they had re-eeived the value of their money, and were very friendly. One sister in oho week took 31 orders for " Thoughts," 7 for " Sunshine," and 2 for Good Health. A brother -Working in the country has taken orders for 175 " Sunshine," 12 yearly subscriptions for the Signs with premium, besides a number of short-term subscriptions, in 17 days. We doubt not that, with a little time for inves-tigation, we could find still more remarkable in-stances. But we should also find a great many who did not succeed as well. Some of these were persons of much experience in this work of can-vassing, and they struck a favorable field. We hope none of those who have not had as good,suc-cess as this will be discouraged because their suc-cess is less. It is the perseverance and determi-nation, the "stick-to-a-tine-ness," which succeeds, with some natural gifts, and especially with God's blessing added. We want to encourage such to press forward, and never become discouraged. Look to God for his blessing, and pray for strength and wisdom. You know it is a good and noble work to get the light of truth before the world. It is the most precious business under heaven to work in the salvation of our fellow-men. Ah ! the future will reveal its value, whether we can see it now or not. Christ did the most noble work ever done in this world; and what was it but to labor for the perishing ? We can be co-la-borers with him. The hard times, caused in part by the poor crops of last year, has made the work harder than it would have been otherwise. This year promises to be more bountiful. From all directions we hear of good crops, and we trust it will make money much more plentiful. The best season of the year is now upoil us, or rapidly approaching. There ' ought to be thousands upon thousands of our good books sold the coming fall and winter. At all our camp-meetings these matters should be talked up, and arrangements made to. bring into the field many active workers. We are exceedingly thankful that so much of our reading matter is being sold the present year. Never were our presses so worked before, and never before were we so far behind. We shall be working into the night from this time forward to catch up with our orders. The ball is started, and the precious truth is going out in all directions. We must keep up with it, and add to its momen-tum continually. If every State Conference will make its arrangements for a vigorous effort all along the line this fall, and the General Confer-ence at its early session perfect these plans, and form others as necessity shall require, we shall see such things accomplished as have never been seen in this cause. Let us all nourish and encourage our canvassing and colporter work, and enlist all who can be useful in them. In this way we shall be keeping our own hearts alive, and saving the souls of our fellow-men. What can demand our attention more than these objects ? G. I. B. THE MISSION FINANCES. OM people will ever be deeply interested in the prosperity of our foreign missions. They must ever be an important part of our aggressive work. As the message is to go with a " loud cry " " to peoples, nations, tongues, and kings," and lighten the earth with its glory, we know we must ex-tend its influence beyond the bounds of our own country and the Western Continent, to the nations of the Old World, Our people have felt the im-portance of this, and have pledged liberally for this object, especially last year. Pledges to the amount of some $45,000 were made in behalf of the English, European, Scandinavian, and Inter-national T. and M. funds, in amounts nearly equal for each. Some of the pledges were to be paid in one, and some in two years. We have recently investigated the standing of these pledges somewhat, and find that between May 1, 1883,
