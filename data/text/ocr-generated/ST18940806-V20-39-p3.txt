THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES, 611 like heart beats within him, keeping every attribute of soul and body alive, and every organ in motion; "meekness," the regulator of temper, the veto of anger, the antidote to fits of madness, the cure 'of a quarrelsome disposition, the power that draws the sting out of external provocations; "temperance," the scales that weigh all our tempers, words, actions, and pursuits, and keep the Christian in a perfect balance.ŠSelected. "INTOLERANT OF EVIL." BY ELDER E. J. WAGGONER. AT the fiftieth annual meeting of the Lon-don Y. M. C. A. one of the speakers, the head master of Harrow;  said in the course of his widress:Š If a Christian would be like Christ, he must be strong and even fierce in character. He must be intolerant of the things that are wrong; he must not suffer them, must not endure them for an in-stant. Just think what influence might be exercised by this great meeting if we were all resolved that in public and in private life we will be intolerant, as intolerant as Christ was, of things that are evil, and base, and vile. Talk about public men and public opinion! we are public opinion. It is in our power to say, as Christian men and women, what we deem Ł to be right; and, depend upon it; if we stick to that which we deem to be right in Christ's name, there is no power on earth that can stand against us. Unfortunately, that idea is very common. This very statement was highly eulogized by a daily paper that is prominent in the ranks of reform, and most people would read it without thi old ng of its real tendency, which is the worst sort of persecution. It means that every professed Christian is to make his ideas of right and wrong the standard of everybody else, and then to do the best he can to force others to come to that standard. Of course people working singly in such a way would accomplish nothing, and would be regarded as nuisances; and so they must unite and agree, on certain points, and then by their combined power and influence compel other People to come to the same standard. There is in human nature enough tendency in that direction, without clergymen teaching it as a Christian duty. Ł The only way in which a man can rightly be intolerant of evil is to be intolerant of it in himself. The Christian is represented as a soldier, and the Christian's life is a warfare, but not against men:Š "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exaltettl itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor. 10 : 3-5. Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God. He re- sisted even unto blood, striving against.  sin; but by no means could he be called intolerant. Fierceness is not a characteristic of a lamb. He was the light of the world, which means that he enlightened the world in respect to righteousness. He "condemned sin in the flesh," both by his life and his words; yet he did not presume to condemn men. He said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12: 47. And so he instructed his disciples. "Be- hold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves." Luke 10 : 3. It is the wolves and not the lambs that are intolerant. Christ's followers are simply to bear a plain testimony,  leaving the Holy Spirit to impress it upon the people, and the Lord himself to deal with those who will not accept it. This was made very clear by the parable of the wheat and the tares. When the servants of the husbandman told hini that tares had appeared in the wheat, And asked if they should root them out, he replied: "Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the har-vest I will say, to the reapers, Gather ye to-gether first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gatlier the wheat into my barn." Matt. 13 : 29, 30. In the same chapter the Saviour explained that "the harvest is the end of the world; and the reap-ers are the angels." The end of the world and the coming of the Lord is the time when evil is to be rooted out by force. And it is to be done only by the Lord and his angels. The spirit of intolerance is the spirit of the Papacy. It is a most insidious evil. The in-tolerant one persuades himself that he is actu-ated solely by righteous zeal for the Lord, when he is in reality moved only by zeal for his own opinions. He opposes an evil, not so much because it is evil, but because it seems to defy him, or, in other words, "it outrages public sentiment." And he seeks to enforce something that. he judges to be right, simply because he judges it to be-  right, and not be-cause the word of the Lord commands it. If he knew the commandment of the Lord, he would know that it is love, and that force and intolerance are a violation of it, because "the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, pa-"tient; in meekness instructing those that op-pose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth." 2 Tim. 2: 24, 25. THE FALL AND REDEMPTION. BY ELDER R. C. PORTER. WHEN the work of creation is completed, and Christ is seated with his Father upon the throne of the universe, he enjoys with the Fa-ther the unsurpassed glory of the voluntary love and worship of his creatures in every world throughout the universe, and from the Father and the Son flow continuously every possible blesSing to make life and home a paradise. Christ, as the Good Shepherd, leads the sheep by the still waters and into green pastures. But soon, alas, one sheep has strayed from the fold! Sin has entered our world, arid it is lost. The enemy who caused the sheep to stray is that exalted angel, next to Christ, who failed to remember the very thing.  for which the Sabbath was given to man, namely, to commemorate his Creator as a God of love, who with almighty power was seek-ing only his greatest good. The creature thus in madness arose and declared before his Creator and the universe of the created that God was unjust and unloving, that his laws were arbitrary and oppressive, and that he, Lucifer, was justly kept down by his un-kind Creator. With self-assertive rebellion he defiantly declared, "I will exalt myself above the stars of God; . . . I will be like the Most High." Isa. 14 : 12-14; Eze. 28 :1.2-27. The fall .of Lucifer was the result of not re-membering God as the "I Am that I Am," that is, as the kind of God that he is, as declared in the true purpose of the Sabbath. Here wds introduced that mystery of iniquity, mystery of self-exaltation, which has brought sorrow, wretchedness, misery, ruin, and death into the universe of God. The plan of attack in the overthroW of man was against true Sabbath keeping. Sa-tan attributed to God a character of jealous hate in withholding from man an experience in time knowledge of things that would so elevate him as to make him like God. Gen. 3 : 1-5. This was just the opposite of 'the character the Sabbath was designed to perpetuate in their minds, as the character of their Cre-ator. The devil well knew that the Sabbath rightly observed would always. perpetuate in the minds of its observers the true character of God, and thus forever th wart his own plans to overthrow God's government. To defeat this object of the Sabbath, be must turn its observers away from its true purpose. -How artfully does he set about this-  work. "Yea, hath God said" (Gen. 3 :1), is designed to in-sinuate doubt. He would say that God does know different. He does not mean what he said. This gives the key which unlocks the mysterious workings of that iniquitous one in his warfare against God all through the course of time. In the light of these facts, we can see why the Sabbath has ever been the center of attack. God and Christ are in the Sab-bath, and to rightly keep it is to rest in God through Christ and to fully believe every word of God, and believe it as he has said it. In the very same manner that Adam and Eve were led astray in the garden, Satan has sought to lead the human family into forbid-den paths ever since. "Yea, hath God said," "The seventh day is the Sabbath," and "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," for its Author is your Creator of love. "But he does not mean what he says," has been, and is, but the old story of Eden over again, only expressed in other words. Over this plea time wily tempter has succeeded in getting the pagans to forget the true God, and to take Sunday as the day for the worship of their in-animate gods. Roman Catholics and pro-fessed Protestants, following in time wake of paganism, with time same plea started in Eden by the evil one, continue to cry, "Yea, hath God said, the seventh day is time Sabbath, but it makes no difference about which day; time church., guided by the Holy Spirit, changed the day; in fine, God does not mean exactly what he said." The Jews and some seventh-day observers who profess to be Christians, blinded by the artful tempter, see in the Sabbath only physi-cal rest, and while they iii outward form ob-serve time correct day as the Sabbath, they keep it in a wrong way, and so miss the won-derful blessing of true Sabbath keeping. Be-tween these two thieves, a false day for the Sabbath, and keeping the true Sabbath in a wrong way, both born of one common parent, "God does not mean what he says," Satan seeks to crucify God and Christ in time Sab-bath, and crucify the Sabbath with them, as -he crucified Christ between two thieves upon Cal vary. But "thanks be unto God, which giveth us time victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" and "always causeth us to triumph in Christ." Jesus triumphed in crucifixion, and he lives and reigns on high. So likewise the Sabbath, though for a time trodden beneath unhallowed .feet, its true meaning set aside, and its true purpose forgotten, still lives and will eternally live, and accomplish its sacred mission, for
