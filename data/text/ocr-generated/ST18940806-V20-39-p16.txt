Wmcox, editor of the SIGNS, on ac-count of a long strain of overwork, has been obliged to seek recuperation at the Rural Health Retreat, St. Helena. He left home on the 26th inst., and after his arrival at the Retreat was laid up with a high fever. But word received as we go to press gives hope of a speedy recovery with needed rest. Will the brethren remember him at the throne of grace? W. N. O. THE Rev. J. M. Foster in the Christian States-man of July 7 has an article on "Loyalty to Christ," in which one of the propositions for which he contends is, "The believer accepts Chiist's life as his model." Now applying this to the Sabbath question, which day will he keep who accepts Christ's life as his model ?ŠThe seventh day of the week, most as-suredly. Jesus .knew no other Sabbath, observed no other, taught no other. Loyalty to Christ de- mands that we follow him, that we take his life as A our model. In this Mr. Foster speaks truly; but, according to God's word, following Christ will lead us to observe the same day and for the same reasons which he did, namely, the seventh day of the week. As A practical offset to the supposed benefits of so-called beneficent societies and superfluous reli-gious combinations, we have General Kelly's state-ment of the composition of the Industrial Army which he recently led to Washington City. Of his 1,200 men he says: "We have among us 73 Masons, 123 Odd Fellows, 76 Knights of Pythias, 28 Ancient Order of United Workmen, 23 Red Men, 850 who bear tradesmen's cards, 150 Young Men's Christian Association men, and a large number of Native Sons." It is also a prominent fact that hundreds of railroad men who placed implicit confidence in the Ameri-can Railway Union have, as a direct consequence, been compelled to join the great army of unemployed. And we have the Industrial Army itself, combined together for the more effectual enforcement of its varied demands on the public. Yet, while ostensi-bly seeking work, their leader says they are in sym-pathy with the strikers, men who voluntarily gave up work at the behest of their organization's leaders. This unemployed army, on the advice of their lead-ers, would not accept work in the positions volun- tarily made Vacant by men of another combination, though they saw that they could have made $4.00 a day by going to work. Thus we have the evidence that trust in man, or combinations of men, is simply leaning upon a broken stick. "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass." Ps. 37 : 5. A WRITER in the Sydney (Australia) Telegraph, of May 9, protests against raking up the old Sunday laws of Charles II. and George III. Some of the prominent men and newspapers are taking a strong stand against their enforcement, calling it by its proper term,Špersecution. One of the laws is quoted as an instance of what we might expect from the code cast during the reign of Charles I. : "No car-rier with any horse or horses; no wagon-man, with any wagon or wagons, nor car-man, with any car or cart or carts, nor wain-man, with any wain, or wains, nor drovers, with any cattle, shall, by them-selves, or any other, travel on the Lord's day, on pain of twenty shillings." We have already given a portion of one passed during the reign of Charles II. Under the law of Queen Elizabeth's time, and under Charles I. also, people were fined for not at-.  tending church on Sundays. So the writer remarks: "There is plenty of ammunition for narrow-minded zealots to shoot at their quiet-going neighbors with. The only question is, How long will the great body of the people stand such nonsense?" He advocates a short repealing code, which should include all the antiquated legislative rubbish relating to the ques-tions in dispute. But we apprehend that no such repealing code will pass. The ministers in large force are howling for a rigid enforcement of all these laws, and they will doubtless accomplish their ob-ject. Like the National Reformers in America, they boast that they control politics and politicians, and that their wishes must be heeded. So, like Pilate of old, the politicians, in order to save them-selves, will grant their requests, and Christ will again be crucified in the persons of his saints. The Strike and the Sabbath.ŠThe recent rail-way strike has aroused anew the zeal of the Sunday-law advocates. Rev. W. W. Case, of the Howard Street Methodist Episcopal Church, San Francisco, as reported in the Chronicle of July 16, declared that "they [the railway companies] have done more fo overthrow one of the pillars of God Almighty than any other influence, and that pillar is, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' " This is a similar strain to many others which have been heard throughout the length and breadth of the land; and yet it would be well if these learned divines would but ask themselves the question whether they them-. selves are not doing more to overthrow' this very pillar than are even the railway companies, when they teach that the seventh day means the first day, virtually saying to the people that God does not mean what he says. We had purposed in this num-ber to write more fully upon this point, but this we shall have to defer until a later time. We wish to present just what Gol in his word predicted eight-een centuries ago concerning this very movement, just how it was foretold over forty years ago that this very thing which we now see before us would take place, and how many of these champions for Sunday observance are fulfilling the prophecy. We believe most heartily in Sabbath observance, true Sabbath observance. We believe in doing just what the Lord said, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; " but God has not made holy the first day of the week, and we cannot keep holy that which he has not made holy, nor can man be compelled by civil law to keep any day holy. The civil law can in no way aid one in keeping holy the Sabbath day. That can be done only by the sanctifying power of the Spirit of Christ in the heart. Ł  JuSt What We Believe.ŠIt has been stated in an exchange that Seventh-day Adventists hold to the view that work on six days of the week is man-datory, that this is unscriptural, and that therefore  the persecution which comes upon them because of working on Sunday is really a persecution on account of error which they hold". This view of the case, that labor on six days of the week is mandatory, has been stated, and as to that we will not now discuss it; but there is a far deeper reason underlying the work of Seventh-day Adventists on the first day of the week. In the first place, they hold that the only Sabbath of the Bible is the seventh day of the week, and that the first-day sabbath is a counter-feit, a usurper, a change which the "man of sin" has sought to make in God's law; and which change this "man of sin" holds to be a sign of his power. No Seventh-day Adventist who did not work on the other five working days would feel called upon to work on Sunday to show his contempt for the day, or to spite his first-day brethren; but to work the other five days and rest upon that day, because it is required by law, either ecclesiastical or civil, is to pay homage to the power from whence the first-day sabbath sprung. In other words, it is the worship of the beast, to him. It is with him a matter of conscience, because to recognize the day is to recog-nize the power which.  gave the day. No true Sab-bath keeper should work on Sunday simply to spite or defy someone else, and we know of none who do. On the other hand, no law has a right to demand that any man, after working five of the working days and observing the Sabbath according to the commandment, should also cease from work on the first day of the week. It is not the mere matter of working six days of the week, although that is an absolute necessity to many a poor man, it is the matter of recognizing the two powers, which stands behind the two Sabbaths. The commandment plainly gives man six days in which. to do his own work, and no earthly power, civil or ecclesiastical, has a right to deprive him of his God-given privilege. Ł THE old Overland Monthly magazine, started by Bret Harte in the sixties, is still the only literary maga-zine published on the Pacific Coast. It had for a short time what bade fair to be a formidable compet-itor in the California Magazine; but as that publica-tion's financial backing was one of the fraudulent transactions that carried down the two McDonald banks in San Francisco, of course it went down with the wreck. Now the Overland takes on new life, and its publishers point with pride to its success. Subscription price, $3.00 a year; single numbers, 25 cents. Overland Monthly Publishing Co., San Fran-cisco.
