The case of the wearied child at the close of a long day spent in a heated and often ill-ventilated school-room is precisely sim-ilar. The teacher may threaten as he likes, no result is produced, save, perhaps, that of tears. The child's physical nature is exhausted, overstrained, and weary ; and a scamper in the fresh air, with no thought of lessons, is, in such cases, the only med-icine of any avail in restoring the jaded powers of mind. The more clearly the interdependence of body and mind is discerned, the less sur-prised or astonished will we feel on learn-ing, by the experience of our own state or by that of others, the immense harm which physical overstrain effects in the case of the recollective powers. It might be added that failure of the memory-pow-ers in the ordinary individual is frequently the first sign and symptom of that over-work and loss of tone which demands rest as its sovereign remedy. The business or the professional man who begins to notice memory-failure in his own case, usually observes also that he is clear-headed each morning, after the rest of the night, but fails as the day wears on. These indications, neglected month by month, it may be, result in memory-disor-ganization. Brain, like body, is longsuf-fering enough, but there is a limit to the endurance of both. Hence, when the memory fails in the active individual, he should seek rest. The sea-breezes or the mountain-side should allure him from his desk or study; and the quiet, which, if wise, he will seek, will be found the only safe and effective means for restoring those powers which are our willing servants,Šso long, indeed, as we treat them reasonably .and well.ŠHealth. FLAVORED CIGARS. " Mo' people like a flavored cigar," said an Indianapolis druggist to a re-porter, who had stepped in to buy a weed. " Try one of these; I think you will like it." The reporter took one of the brand recommended to him, lighted it, and be-gan to smoke. " I have to put up considerable cigar flavor," continued the drug man, " and 1 suppose some men would n't find it so dif-ficult a thing to quit smoking if they knew  what the popular flavors are made of. On second thought, though, I don't think it would make any difference. The fact that snipes'Šthat is, old cigar stumps Šare worked over into cigarettes and smoking tobacco, though thoroughly ventilated in the newspapers, never cured a smoker of the habit. Awhile ago it was shown that some nasty dis-eases were contracted from smoking cigars made in low tenement houses and by leprous Chinese ; but the smokers never flinched, but smoked calmly on." " Tell me something about these fla-vors," said the reporter. " Well, since you insist on it, I will. A flavor I have made a good deal ofŠit's a flavor that, it the language of the trade, makes a ten cent cigar for five cents '--is made as follows : Gum guaiac, gum tolu, tonqua beans, and essence of pine-apple, of each one ounce; valerian root, two ounces; laudanum (tincture of opium) one ounce; oil of rose, six drops; Jamaica rum, half a pint; macerate for thirty-six hours, and pour off, using one ounce to a pint of port-wine to blow on the fillers. " A good many men who get attached to a certain brand of cigars do n't know what chains them. It's the opium ; and they get in the habit of using it uncon-sciously. Valerian taken habitually ren-ders the heart's action more rapid, but feebler, causes hurried respiration, and may occasion congestion of the kidneys. If its use is long-continued, it may para-lyze the spinal cord, so the books say. lts action on the tongue and throat is more prompt and apparent, frequently causing epithelium. As to opium, its in-fernal effects are well known. It would take an almanac to enumerate all the dis-eases it occasions. It produces contrac-tion of the pupils of the eyes, affects the digestive functions by blunting the gastric sensation, checking all tissue changes. It tends to constipate the bowels by di-minishing the proper secretions of the liver and pancreas ; and the blood, being but partially oxygenated, is rendered un-fit for a return to the heart, and stagnates in the lungs. Opium has a tendency to augment Bright's disease, diabetes, and other diseases of the kidneys. It's opium and valerian that makes the artificially flavored cigar popular." Š Indianapolis Journal.
