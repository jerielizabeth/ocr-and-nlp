THE HEALTH REFORMER. 245 their wearers ; and he refers also to the distor-tion and injury to the foot that they often in-duce. He says : " Last year I was sent for to see a young lady in one of our London hotels. She wished to consult me about her foot. On seeing it I thought its state depended upon her boots, and I asked to see them. The boots were brought in by the lady's maid, but the only thing I could ohserve about them was the immensely high heels. I said : It is the high heels of your boots that cause the mischief, and unless you diminish them I can do nothing for you.' She became quite angry, and said she could not alter them. I cannot do it and will not.' Suddenly she again toned down, and said : ' Pray, sir, what would people say if they saw me walking about the park without high heels I' I said : It is simply heels versus brains. If you have brains, you will cut off the heels ; if you have no brains, you will con-tinue to wear them.' She fortunately had brains, cut off the heels, and her foot got quite well."ŠS'el. Why Disguise Your Food? IF it is good and wholesome, the taste cannot be bad ; then why not enjoy its natural taste, and not disguise it with condiments I Were I persuaded it was necessary to swal-low a bitter pill, I should want it sugar-coated, or would take it in honey, or molasses, so as to avoid tasting the thing itself. If one felt himself obliged to eat a slice of pork, in order to make him strong for labor, being delusively persuaded that such stuff is the best food to " stick by the rib," it would be no wonder if he should cover it over with mustard or pepper sauce, and then take a small piece with a larger piece of bread or potato, in order to get it down without tasting it. But when we use good hygienic food, grains, fruits, and vegetables, which of themselves are pleasant to the unperverted taste, why should it be thought necessary to avoid their natural taste by the use of indigestible condiments 4 Do pep-per and salt taste so much better than food that grains and vegetables cannot be relished without them / I am fully persuaded that the use of these things is only a perversion of natural taste ; and that it is merely habit that binds peo-ple to their use. It is not customary to salt apples and peaches and fruits in general ; if this had been our custom from childhood, I doubt not these would not relish without salt. They would taste " so flat." For myself, I can see no reason why good potatoes, turnips, beans, and peas should need salting to make them rel-ish any more than apples and peaches. And having carried out the theory in practice for a number of years, I am fully confirmed in it. I can, and am necessitated to do so occasionally, eat salt with garden vegetables, but I prefer their  natural taste ; and would as lief have the salt in my fruit-sauce as in them. And I believe that +All who will give this theory a fair test in practice, will arrive at the same conclusion. Why use indigestible thingsŠthings that are not food in any senseŠto make our food relish, as though the Creator had not made these things right ? When we have undeceived ourselves, we shall know that food tastes better than any-thing else ; and we shall have no desire to bur-den our system with the things which it cannot use, and needlessly tax its energies in the extra work of casting them out; to say nothing of their evil effects as irritating stimulants, lead-ing to intemperance, gluttony, and sensuality. Who has faith enough in the theory to give it a thorough test in practice1 Such shall know the truth. R. F. COTTRELL. Is it Mad Fanaticism? AT a recent annual meeting of Friends in New York City, a member remarked that " pies and puddings were the original cause from which many drunkard's graves had been filled." The editor of the People, a paper pub-lished in the interest of liquor selling, was so much amazed at this that he was obliged to " stop and take breath," (and, doubtless, a drink). His disgust and wrath found expression in the dec-laration, " Fanaticism run mad finds here its fullest exemplification." If this sentiment is wild fanaticism, we are very happy that such honest, conscientious, steady, people as are our Quaker friends are the afflicted ones ; and we are not unwilling to acknowledge our devotion to the same senti-ments, and an earnest desire that such " fanat-icism " might become the ruling spirit of the day.ŠEn. A QUAKER AND HIS DOCTOR.ŠA Quaker who had been seriously ill, but was fast recov-ering, was recommended by his medical man to take some " stout." " Indeed," said the Quak-er, " how am I to get strength out of that which does not contain it 1" " But you must take it," said the doctor, " or I will not be an-swerable for the consequences." " Thou may-est make thyself perfectly easy about it, for I will take the consequences, but not the drink." " Well, you'll do yourself great harm," said the doctor. " Nay, my friend, but I can't do harm to myself by abstaining from a bad thing." " But you require it as a medicine just now," said the doctor. The Quaker hesitated for a moment, and then said, " Dost thou like ' stout,' doctor I " " Yes, I do." " I thought so," said the Quaker. " Go thy way. I pay thee for thy skill, and not for thy likings ! "ŠTemperance Record.
