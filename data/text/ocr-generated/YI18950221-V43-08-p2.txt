As to Iceland, it is said, on the contrary, that there are no more than two or three trees on the whole island. " In certain localities the hills are covered with a species of earth of remarkable fertility. Rye and barley, in years when they ripen, yield more than thirty-fold returns. Turnips and potatoes also do well. The Land of Ice, on the contrary, possesses no grain culture." It is said that in the ninth century Flocke, a Norwegian pirate, upon the discovery of these islands found large herds of sheep living in a wild state upon them, whence the name " Faroe," from Faar (sheep), and tier (isl-ands). Another interesting fact to notice, and that seems to-day well established, is that Christopher Columbus landed here in 1467, and that from this point he made Iceland, where the inhabitants told him of the existence of Vineland, meaning America. M. Fred. Lacroix has seen a note written in the identical handwriting of the illustrious navigator, stating that after he sailed in the Mediterranean he cruised in the waters of the north. ' Christopher Columbus adds that he " came to Faeroeer, whose inhabitants at the time sustained commercial relations with Ice-land, about 1467." Up to the fifteenth century the Scandinavian peoples were in com-munication with their American settlements at Greenland and Vineland. Alexander von Humboldt asserts as an equally certain fact, that it was at Reykjavik where the celebrated Genoesan gleaned from the Icelandic legends that information which put it into his head to search a new commer-cial water-route to the East Indies. The Faroe group and Iceland, are, therefore, to follow the views of these and other reliable travelers, as it were the hinges upon which turned the gate that opened America to Europe. From a geographical standpoint, at least, these islands represent certainly one of the parts or links of that consecutive chain which, with the Orkneys, Shetland, and Iceland, join the northern extremity of Scotland to the coasts of Greenland ; the archipelago of Faroe which contains as stated before some twenty-two islands, large and small, rising in the midst of this large channel, and occupying at its full length one degree of latitude. Traveling from place to place, one finds the landscape changing at every turn. Sometimes the steep banks will assume a gentle slope, and we discover, ensconced at the foot of the rocks, charming cabins, emerging here and there from their pretty green inclosures, which are almost always sown to barley, the only sta-ple cereal raised on the island. Farther on, on the contrary, is a grand mass of block and bare rock, hollowed out by dashing cascades, and pierced by deep caverns, shooting upward from a single spur, as it were, above the waves to an altitude of nearly one thousand feet. The pen is unable to describe the effect pro-duced by the spectacle equally grand and ex-traordinary, of these abrupt, rocky upshoots, which stand forth perpendicularly upon the bosom of the sea ; we can therefore do no bet-ter than to refer the interested reader direct to the cut taken from a photograph, of Trold-Nypen (meaning " sorcerers' turnips "). From a religious point of view, we cannot but believe that in the providence of God some precious souls from these far-away islands will hear and receive the truth into honest hearts, and bring forth its fruits unto life eternal through Christ Jesus, our Lord ; for " the isles shall wait for his law " (Isa. 42 : 4), and surely these are some of them, and, as we believe, among the more promising. A. K. EARTHQUAKE WAVES. THE pulsations of the great earthquake in Greece last April were perceived in England, and, it is believed, at the Cape of Good Hope, by means of very delicate instruments con-trived for the purpose of registering any slight shaking of the earth's crust. In like manner the shock of the Constantinople earthquake of July last was perceived at various meteorolog-ical observatories in Austria, Russia, Ger-many, Holland, France, and England. By a comparison of times, combined with the distances from Constantinople of the places where pulsations were observed, a fairly accu-rate estimate of the velocity with which the earthquake waves traveled was obtained. The average speed was about two miles a second. This is almost the same velocity as was calculated for the pulsations of the Greek earthquake in April. At this rate, if it were continued without diminution, the wave would pass completely round the earth along a great circle, in about three hours and a half. One of the English instruments which registered these pulsations is at the bottom of a deep mine near Newcastle-on-Tyne, and its delicacy may be judged from the fact that it has re-corded the beating of the waves on the sea-coast ten miles away. SCRAPS OF ASTRONOMY.Š NO. 3. THE two lines running parallel to the equator twenty-three and one-half degrees therefrom, are called the Tropics, which is from the Greek, and signifies " turning line "Š the sun turning at these two points, alternately, north and south. Because the sun was in Capri- cornus, when vertical to that Tropic, it was called Capricorn. Aquarius was emblematical of the rainy season, which the sun enters about January 21. Now the opposite sign, Leo, rises in the evening, and is generally considered to be one of the most beautiful constellations of the zodiac. About February 21 the sun enters Pisces (the fishes), a reminder to the ancients of their fishing month. From February 21 to March 21 we are brought round to the point where we started. By this we see that the earth has performed a revolution around the sun ; but a surer evi-dence is the annual parallax of the stars. We have given the signs and constellations as they undoubtedly were when named, mak- ing no distinction. The ancient philosophers believed that the stars had much to do with the destiny of the moral and physical world. The science founded upon this belief is called " astrology," meaning discourse, or language, of the stars. Anciently the stars were studied largely for purposes of prognostication. It seems that fragments of this ancient astrology have come along through the ages down to the present time ; and, like the foolish idea of the dead having knowledge, are believed, against all reason and revelation. There are those still in almost every com-munity, who think certain stellar signs govern certain portions of the body, and that it is very important to wait for the sign to be just right before doing certain things,Š such as  weaning colts, calves, lambs, etc., and some-times even babies. With people who enjoy the light of true science and philosophy, these and similar notions have gone out of date long ago ; so we cannot, like the ancient Grecians, believe the stars " to feed on air, and to be the breathing holes of the universe." J. M. AVERY. FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR DEGREES BELOW ZERO. FOUR hundred and twenty-four degrees Fahr-enheit below zero ! Just what this means it is almost impossible to imagine ; and yet it is one of the temperatures which has been reached and used in laboratory research, and has been made the subject of some highly inter-esting experiments and explanations by Pro-fessor Dewar before the British Royal Institu-tion. Four hundred degrees below zero is not an every-day temperature, nor can it be reached by more every-day means than the expansion of liquid air, which latter Professor Dewar has succeeded in producing in comparatively large quantities, and in storing by novel and in-genious methods, to be used as required in the study of matter at abnormally low tempera-ture, exactly as a spirit lamp or a Bunsen burner is used in studying the properties of different bodies at the higher temperatures. The tensile strength of iron at four hundred degrees below zero is just twice what it is at sixty degrees above. It will take a strain of sixty instead of thirty tons to the square inch, and equally curious results have come out as to the elongation of metals under these condi-tions. It was an idea of Faraday that the magnetism in a permanent magnet would be increased at very low temperatures, and ex-periments with comparatively low tempera-tures had rather negatived Faraday's sugges-tion ; but Professor Dewar has completely verified the opinion of the famous savant, having shown that a magnet at the extremely low temperature made possible by the liquid air, had its power increased by fifty per cent. IS IT POSSIBLE ? "ACCORDING to Invention, a building has recently been erected by Herr Wagner, an architect at Limburg, solely of materials formed of ashes, without any admixture of sand. It is claimed that hard natural stones of almost every variety have been successfully imitated with this very cheap material." Have you ever seen or read of those who were once poor and ragged boys, and consid-ered as of no account, yet who became men of note ? The world has hundreds of them. If a building can be made of ashes, there is no boy so poor that he cannot be turned to some noble purpose if he only has a mind to do it. YEsop was a slave ; Robert Burns, the great Scottish poet, was a shepherd ; Homer, king of poets, was once a beggar ; Dr. Kitto, editor of the " History of the Bible," worked at brick and mortar ; Linnaeus, the greatest of botanists, was a shoemaker ; John Prideaux, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, was once the boy who swept Exeter College ; Sextus V, pope of Rome, herded hogs when a youth ; Martin Luther often sang for his bread when a poor school boy ; President Garfield was a cabin boy ; Governor Toussaint, general and statesman, was born a Haytian slave. Yes ; it is possible. You may look, and really be, so much like the other man that it would be hard to tell which came from the ash-grate and which from the great quarry. Take courage from the ashes, boys, and plod away ! P. GIDDII4GS.
