AUG. 12, 1884.]" THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 525 large congregations. To an outsider it appears more like a money-making scheme. They charge an entrance fee of from ten to twenty-five cents, according to the reputation of the man who is to speak: We inquired of one of the ministers con- corning the prosperity of the meeting. He replied that the meetings were well attended, but that they were not very spiritual, as the people were mostly Christians and were taking a recreation. The import was that as there were no sinners to convert, meetings particularly spiritual, were not called for. How does this compare with 2 Tim. 3 ; 5, " Having a form of godliness, but deny- ing the power thereof. "I A Methodist camp- meeting too Christian to enjoy much of the Spirit of God I Wonderful !

OWEN. NORTHERN MICHIGAN.ŠSome time has elapsed since my last report appeared in the REVIEW ; yet I have not since that time been altogether idle, al-though I have not been able to devote as much time to the work as I have desired. ' b During the past winter I held a series of meetings at Spring-ville, and also at Sherman, Wexford Co., with some success. May 30, came to Petoskey, and preached three discourses to the brethren here. June 1, commenced meetings in the Fair Grove school- house, about eight miles west of Petoskey. The M. E. church have a class here. The majority of this people were convinced, and freely confessed to us, as we visited among them, that we had the truth, but were making their feelings their guide instead of God's word. However, a few of their number were constrained to obey. Four adults were baptized. Dr. Lay was with me, and rendered excellent help both in our meetings and in visiting from house to house. I became very much at- tached to this dear people, and earnestly hope the Lord may yet lead many of them out into the full light and liberty of gospel truth. We organized a small class here, and left them praying God to con-tinue with them and lead them on by his precious Spirit. Returned to Petoskey, and held a few meetings, which greatly encouraged the brethren, and resulted in the conversion of one soul, who we hope may be- come of service to the cause here. Thence we came to Gaylord to engage in tent labor. Here we have_ had quite a novel experience. By permission of the supervisors, weepitched- our tent in the court-yard, got it all seated, and ready to commence meetings, and advertized in both the village papers to coin- mence services in the tent July 5. July 3, just at night, we received an order by telegram from the Sheriff, who was out of town, to hold no meetings on that ground, also to move our tent as soon as possible. The next day being Friday, and a heavy rain setting in and continuing nearly all day, which prevented our immediate compliance with the order, our tent had to remain in the court-yard until Monday morning. Then we removed to an- other part of the village, pitched again, and corn- menced meetings July 9. There are a number of scattered brethren in and around Gaylord, who were greatly strengthened and encouraged by these meetings. Sabbath, July 19, was a good day for them. They all met at the tent, and we enjoyed a precious season ; yet there was but little outside interest, and after much consultation and earnest prayer, we decided that our time could be more profitably spent in some other locality. Hence we removed Monday, July 21, to Vanderbilt, where we are now laboring with a good interest and a large and attentive audience. We find the people here kind and generous, and many seem hungering for the truth. Dr. H. S. Lay is still with me, and we earnestly request the prayers, of our brethren that the Lord may give us success in winning some of these precious souls to Christ. R. C. HoRTON. __________ BLENDON.ŠOn Sabbath, the 26th tilt., friends from this place, Wright, and Allendale, met near Lamont, where we administered the holy ordinance of baptism to fourteen believers. In the after- noon social-meeting, fifty good testimonies were borne, and three arose for the prayers of God's people. Several who have been long in the truth, expressed the thought that it was the best meet- ing of the kind they had ever attended. The Spirit of God was manifestly present. Five more, heads of families, gave their hearts to God yes- terday, and there will soon  be more  whole families. We are expecting to see a large church in Blen- don, for even our enemies join us in praying God to break the power of Satan and drive him from the neighborhood. On Sunday evening the tent was filled as us- ual with an attentive audience. The Lord gives freedom in the presentation of his word. Since our last report a few more have signed the cove- nant. With thankful hearts and abiding faith in God we move forward in the good work. Pray for us. E. P. DANIELS. MRS. E. B. LANE. MICHIGAN. UNION CITY AND TEKONSHA.--We closed our meetings at Union City July 9, there not being an interest to warrant our staying longer. The people were kind, but seemed to care nothing for the truth. We moved our tent eight miles east to Tekonsha, and commenced our meetings July 24. We have a pleasant oak grove on Main street free of charge for our tent. Our interest thus far is quite good, extending for miles into the country. Our congregations average from eighty to two hundred and twenty-five. The people are mindful of our wants, suppying us plentifully with vegeta- bles, and are quite liberal with their donations of money. We are now in the midst of the Sabbath A deep interest seems to be manifested, question. OGDEN CENTER, LENAWEE Co.ŠBegan meetings here July 13, and have now given twenty-four dis- courses. The interest to hear has been good from the beginning. At no time has our congregation in the evening been less than one hundred, and often it has been two or three hundred. Sunday evenings we have counted fifty and sixty teams from the country. Have held Sabbath-school every Sabbath with an attendance of fifty at the first school, sixty-five at the second, and seventy-live at the third. The people kindly supply us with pro- visions. Bro. Burnham was with us a short time, but has now gone to assist elsewhere. We labor looking to the Lord for his blessing to attend the work. W. C. WALES. G. W. CAVINESS. and we have reason to hope for some success. There are four ministers living in the place, but none of them come near our meeting. There were but few at their union service last Sunday even- ing, while our tent was well filled. The following is from the Tokonsha Yews:Š "Meetings at the ' tent ' during the week have been somewhat broken up in consequence of the rain. ThC attendance, however, has been fair. The quiet, gentlemanly bearing of the managers commends their efforts here to the good sense of the commit- nity and the hearty co-operation of Christian peo- pie," H. M. KENYON. M. B. MILLER. H. VEYSEY. BLOOMINGDALE, VAN BUREN Co.ŠWe com- menced meetings here July 25. The ground had previously been canvassed. Our tent is not large enough to seat all who come. We have never seen a better interest, and it increases as we present the Sabbath question. People come six and seven miles, and are not kept away by threatening weather. We see the same faces every night. We have plenty of visiting to do, and the people ask plenty of questions. We hear of one who expects to keep next Sabbath, and there are, no doubt, others. We will hold meetings every Sabbath at 3 P. is., and expect to see all the brethren here who can come. There are calls for meetings in the surrounding country. People say it is the largest religious meeting ever held in this place. T. S. PARMELEE. GEO. 0. WELLMAN. GrEO. 0. STATES. HICKMAN MILLER. JEFFERSON.ŠAug. 2 the church at Osseo and those interested at Pittsford met with the church at Jefferson. This church is about four miles from the tent-meeting at Pittsford conducted by Brn. A. W. Bather and C. J. Lamson. There has been a very deep interest at Pittsford, which still con- -alums. There has not been a single small congre- gation, nor a meeting broken up by bad weather, and now, after seven weeks of meetings, the at- tendance at times reaches four hundred people. A large delegation from Pittsford enjoyed the meeting at Jefferson. This is the first general meeting I have been able to attend for more than two months, having been confined at home with rheumatism. We had a most interesting Sabbath- school, a sermon from John 12 : 38-41, after which eleven souls, all adults, and nine of them heads of families, were buried with, their Lord in baptism. Eight of them were invited with the church at Jefferson, two at Osseo, and one at Hillsdale. The churches contiguous to Pittsford have been re- freshed and encouraged by the tent-meetings so near them,' and quite a number have embraced the truth as a result of the meetings. The opposition is just now very strong. ' Several sermons have been preached against the truth, and more are to follow.

Interest, order, and attend- ante continue good, even through harvest and since the Sabbath has been presented. Even after seating the people upon the rostrum and filling all the seats, we have quits a congregation around the tent on the outside on Sunday evenings. We have no meetings in the tent on Monday evenings, but hold Bible-readings and lectures four or five miles out in the country in different , directions. Last evening at the Maple Grove school-house, all the aisles were filled, the children were seated upon the desks, and the room was packed solid. The rest of the audience listened outside on all four sides of the house. A minister was present y eveninwho invite  ate dthe Smith school-house us to hold our meeting where  next  he has Mondaa g charge. We accept. Some begin to obey, and the interest spreads farther and wider. Bro. B. Stare- man, Bro. Walter Webber, and Sr. Nellie Webber, are with us. We find them all good missionary workers, and find plenty for them to do. Our post-office is May, our village Mayville. We ŠThe strongest link in the chain of society is true friendship.
