THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES.-SUPPLEMENT. THE TRUE MISSIONARY. BY ELD. JAMES WHITE. * " Go ye into all the world and preach the gos-pel to every creature," are the words of the Great Missionary, as he closed his mission here below, and was about to ascend to Heaven to enter upon another work. And this high and holy commission given to Christ's first chosen repre-sentatives upon Olivet, more than eighteen hun-dred years ago, has not lost its power to move the N ery soul of those who have within them anything of the true missionary spirit. Christians have ever had a world-wide mission. And from the time this mission was first given to the present time, there have been.a few men who had the " Go " in them. But in the closing message, fraught with the deepest interest, the word is, " Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind," " Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." Luke 14:21, 23. And the extent of this work is indicated by the prophetic declaration, "Thou must prophecy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. Rev. 10 : 11. Men and means are wanted. Our schools should be crowded with young men, and young women too, preparing themselves for this great work. Some should be studying the languages iu reference to the work in other countries.. And while these should be encouraged, especially those of our brethren of other tongues who have already engaged in the work, and helped to im-mediate usefulness, they must make a complete consecration of all to the work in order to be of any real benefit to the cause. The most worthless class of ministers in exis-tence are those who have been educated at char-ity schools. The most valueless missionaries are those who are sent upon high salaries. And the poorest kind of Christians are those who have been made such at those missionary posts where the impression has been given that all they had to do was to hear, the missionary being sup-ported by the liberalities of others. The prin-ciples of labor and sacrifice must be incorpo-rated into all our missionary operations. Jesus, the great missionary, made an infinite I sacrifice. His mission was one of toil, care, and weariness. He was a man of sorrows, and ac- quainted with grief. Among the children of INSTRUCTIONS TO GOD'S PEOPLE. men in this world, he was as a homeless stran-ger. And he did not hold out inducements of worldly prosperity and a life of ease and afflu-1 ence to any who were disposed to become his THE Lord gave special instruction to his peo- followers. ple anciently, when and how to appear before When a " certain scribe came, and said unto rum He also made them special promises pro-him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever Tiding they would obey this instruction.

"The first of the first-fruits of thy Jesus says to the twelve, " Behold, I send you land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye thy God." " Ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves." fruits of your harvest unto the priest; and ye Matt. 10 : 16. " The disciple is not above his shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be ac-master, nor the servant above his lord. It is cepted for you." "And ye shall offer that day enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?" Verses 24, 25. In the wonderful conversion of Paul, and his call to the work of the ministry, he does not re-ceive the impression that even his learning and superior talents would secure to him a large sal-ary and a high reputation as a Christian minis-ter. But on the very start, the Lord says of him to Ananias, "I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake." Acts 9 :16. *Written in 1874. The missionary work is one of sacrifice. Christ set the example. And the true hearted mission-ary will bid adieu to worldly hopes, and worldly prospects, and will hang all his hopes for this life, and for that which is to come, upon Jesus Christ. He has hold from above. The earth may tremble beneath his feet, worldly comforts may for a time be beyond his reach, and earthly prospects may fade. He has hold from above, and can rejoice in tribulation. It is the Lord's plan that men should swing out by faith on his promises, and stay swung out until they have fully proved their strength. The hundred-fold in the line of friends to adminis-ter to their needs, does not come until the mis-sionary has first forsaken houses, brethren, sis-ters, father, mother, wife, children, and lands. Our gracious Lord has his hands full of bless-ings for his people, waiting to respond to their acts of faith. He is more willing to pour the Holy Spirit upon them than parents are to be-stow good gifts upon their dear children. But these blessings come in response to acts of living faith. It is the Lord's will that men and women should give themselves fully to him, to be fully his, the representatives of their Lord, and his true missionaries. And it is also his will that all his people should cherish the spirit of willing sacrifice to send the light and truth of our time, by our publications, and by living teachers, to every Christian land. We are told that the sacrifices and the mis-sionary efforts of Seventh-day Adventists fall below other denominations. A case came to our notice, while passing over a railroad in the State of Illinois. We entered into conversation with a Presbyterian missionary to China, who had just returned with his two children, both born in China, to find homes for them and have them educated here, while he and their mother would return to close their labors and their lives in China, away from their children. Where are the men and women among us who would make similar sacrifices ? And yet the world have reason to expect of those who are looking for the soon coming of the Lord grea-ter sacrifices than are being made by any other people. Bead and Remember. Ł 40 --41, O. -4. OUR CAMP-MEETINGS. BY MRS. F.. G. WHITE. the Lord." " And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears until the self-same day that you brought an offering unto your God." Ex. 22:29; 23:19; Lev. 23:10, 11, 12, 14. A wave offering was a thank offering. It was an acknowledgement of God's prospering hand tem-porally, Š an expression of thankfulness that Heaven had given the first and best it possessed for the human race; and of belief that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and that through his resurrection they would enter the realm of the blest. WHILE preparing for the meeting, each indi-vidual should closely and critically examine his own heart before God. If there have been un-pleasant feelings, discord, or strife in families, it should be one of the first acts of preparation to confess these faults one to another and pray with and for one another. Humble yourselves before God, and make an earnest laffort to empty the soul-temple of all rubbish,Šall envyings; all jealousies, all suspicions, all fault-findings. Ł " Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Hum-ble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. " The Lord speaks; enter into your closet, and in silence commune with your own heart; listen to the voice of truth and conscience. Nothing will give such clear views of self as secret prayer. He who seeth in secret and knoweth all things, will enlighten your .understanding and answer your petitions. Plain, simple duties that must not be neglected will open before you. Make a covenant with God to yield yourselves and all your powers to his service. Do not carry this undone work to the camp-meeting. If it is not done at home your own soul will suffer, and oth-ers will be greatly injured by your coldness, your stupor, your spiritual lethargy. The words of the prophet Ezekiel are applica-ble to the people professing the truth at this time: " Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face; should I be in-quired of at all by them ? Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Every man of the house of Israel that set-teth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coma to the prophet, I the Lord will an-swer him that cometh, ac cording to the multi-tude of his idols." If we love the things of the world and have pleasure in unrighteousness, or fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, we have put the stumbling-block of our iniquity before our face, and have set up idols in our heart. And unless by determined effort we put them away, we shall never be acknowledged as the sons and daugh-ters of God. Here is a work for families to engage in coming up to our holy convocations. Let the preparation for eating and dressing be a sec-ondary matter, but let deep heart-searching com-mence at home. Pray three times a day, and, like Jacob, be importunate. At hone is the place to find Jesus; then take him with you to the meeting, and how precious will be the hours you spend there. But how can you expect to feel the presence of the Lord and see his power displayed, when the individual work of prepara-tion for that time is neglected ? For your soul's sake, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of others, work at home. Pray as you are not accustomed to pray. Let the heart break before God. Set your house in order. Prepare. Ł . when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without 3T°111 children for the occasion Teach them that  blemish of the first year, for a burnt offeringit is not of so much consequence that they appear unto with fine clothes as that they appear before God with clean hands and pure hearts. Remove ev-ery obstacle that may have been in their way,Šall differences that may have existed between themselves, or between you and them. By so doing you will, invite the Lord's presence into your homes, and holy angels will attend you as you go up to the meeting, and their light and presence will press back the darkness of evil an-gels. Even unbelievers will feel the holy atmos-phere as they enter the encampment. Oh, how much is lost by neglecting this important work !
