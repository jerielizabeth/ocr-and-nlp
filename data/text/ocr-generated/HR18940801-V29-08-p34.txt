25 4 RELIEF DEPARTMENT. RELIEF DEPARTMENT. [THIS department has been organized in the interest of two classes : Young orphan children, and 2. The worthy sick poor. The purposes of this department, as regards these two classes, are are follows : Š I. To obtain intelligence respecting young and friendless or-phan children, and to find suitable homes for them. 2. To obtain information respecting persons in indigent or very limited circumstances who are suffering from serious, though cur-able maladies, but are unable to obtain the skilled medical atten-tion which their cases may require, and to secure for them an opportunity to obtain relief by visiting the Sanitarium Hospital. The generous policy of the managers of the Medical and Surgical Sanitarium has provided in the Hospital connected with this in-stitution a number of beds, in which suitable cases are treated without charge for the medical services rendered. Hundreds have already enjoyed the advantages of this beneficent work, and it is hoped that many thousands more may participate in these advantages. Cases belonging to either class may be reported in . writing to the editor of this journal. It should be plainly stated and clearly understood that neither orphan children nor sick persons should be sent to the Sanitarium or to Battle Creek with the expectation of being received by us, unless previous arrangement has been made by correspondence or otherwise; as it is not infrequently the case that our accom-modations are filled to their utmost capacity, and hence additional cases cannot be received until special provision has been made. Persons desiring further information concerning cases men-tioned in this department, or wishing to present cases for notice in these columns, should address their communications to the editor, Dr. J. H. Kellogg, Battle Creek, Mich. He wishes especially to state that those who apply for children will be expected to accompany their applications by sat-isfactory letters of introduction or recommendations.] WORD has come from Colorado telling us of a thirteen-year-old boy (No. 232) whose father is dead. His mother desires to place him in some home, but does not wish to give up. full control. He has brown eyes and hair, and has not been allowed to run the streets. Will some one offer this boy a home for a few years ? Is there not some good home in the Southern States where a twelve-year-old boy (No. 233) can find parents? This boy's father and mother are both dead, and just at this age he surely needs to be sur-rounded with good influences and to receive kind advice and encouragement, so that he may grow to be a useful man. He has black eyes, and is )aid to be intelligent and in good health. Nos. 235, 236, AND 237.ŠThe father of two girls and one boy, ages respectively 12, I I, and 9 years, now living in Massachusetts, is anxious that his chil-dren may have the care and training such as only some kind mother could give. He desires that homes be provided for them in the New England States. The children all have dark eyes and hair, are industrious, and have not been neglected. No. 217 is a nine-year-old boy living in Indiana. He has dark blue eyes and dark hair, is said to be obedient, and has had good care. Last winter his father died, leaving his mother with no means of support, and he has no friends who are able to care for him. Will some family receive him as their own, and still direct his feet in the right way ? No. 218 is a healthy Swedish boy only four years old, living in Minnesota, who has no one to care for him. At the present time he has a temporary home, but he cannot remain in this place long. He has brown hair and eyes, and is said to be an intelligent little fellow. He would surely cheer some home, should a kind mother bestow upon him her love and care. No. 231 is another Michigan boy. He is but nine years old, and is left in the world with no one to care for him but the county authorities, as his mother is dead and his father has deserted him. He has dark blue eyes and brown hair, and is said to be kind, easily governed, and to have fine sensi-bilities. Who will offer a home to him who is worse than an orphan ? THREE more children have been placed in homes during the month. No doubt our readers have noticed that among the cases advertised, boys who are in need of homes are in the majority. Many persons would gladly take a quiet and amiable little girl into their home, but few wish to be annoyed with the noise of an active boy. Here is one mother who offered to furnish a home for two boys to fill the vacancy caused by the death of three of her own children. As we had learned of some children whose mother wasŁ dead and their only home a boarding place, we at once wrote to this friend who was anxious to bestow her love upon some motherless boys. The following word has just been received from her : Š " We have obtained the little boy, also his brother. They are real smart, and we have learned to love them already. Their ages are eight and fourteen years. My love for the work does not lessen because we have these boys ; but if anything, it in-creases. We only wish we could do more when we see so many poor, homeless children all around us." SEVERAL weeks ago application was made for a certain little girl who was advertised in the Relief Department. As other applications had already been received for the child, arrangements had been made for her to go elsewhere. Another little girl
