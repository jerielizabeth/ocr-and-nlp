THE HEALTH REFORMER. 233 ous, in consequence of its being difficult of assim-ilation, no less than from the distention it occasions. Muffins and crumpets are still more so. I have frequently noticed the wan, blood-less faces of pretty American women, especially in the Southern States, and have reason to be-lieve that this peculiarity is, in a great measure, owing to their fondness for hot buckwheat cake, which they consume with avidity. In partaking the first meal, it is necessary to observe one broad ruleŠnamely, that its solid-ity should be regulated by the labor and ex-ercise to be performed, and to the time allotted for dinner. Luncheons, as a rule, are neither necessary nor desirable, either for the robust or the infirm. A midday repast, between breakfast and dinner, is peculiar to England. It has been aptly denominated an insult to the former, and a reproach to the latter. A great many people seem to adopt the specious aphor-ism of Dr. Temple, that " the stomach is like a school-boy, always at mischief unless it be em-ployed." But modern physiological science is directly opposed to such a pleasant theory, which, according to one authority, " has occa-sioned more dyspeptic disease than that respect-able physician could ever have cured, had his practice been as successful as that of iEscula-pins, and his life as long as an antediluvian." Another question arisesŠWhen is the proper time to dine / We may readily reply to this by simply paraphrasing a line from Dr. Young's " Night Thoughts." Nature cries ONE, while Fashion points at EIGHT. It has been averred that the best time for dining is, " for a rich man, when he can get an appetite ; and for a poor man, when he can get food." But this aphorism is neither rea-sonable nor practicable. Some regularity must be observed, and for obvious reasons; such regularity, in truth, being necessary to health. There can be little doubt, however, that the very late dinner hour patronized by modern society is highly unnatural, undesirable and pernicious. The fatigues undergone by fashion-able folk during the day do not tend to whet appetiteŠrather they serve to blunt its crav-ings ; besides, the stomach of such is deterio-rated, and unfitted from properly fulfilling its functions. Of course, tempting viands are presented on the dining tables, prepared by practiced and skillful cooks, while the pleasures of love, friendship, and social converse become added as incentives. All the more dangerous, I should say. It is possible to cloy the stomach, and yet derive no benefit therefrom, but con-trariwise. Better be in the condition of the Cambridge students of yore, and " diet upon fasting every day," than cause the human sys-tem to receive more than it can digest. " I restrained myself," observes Bacon, " to so reg- ular a diet as to eat flesh but once a day, and a little at a time, without salt or vinegar." I apprehend it would greatly redound to the advantage of the community, especially of the-" Upper Ten," were the wants of nature made to give precedence to the requirements of fashion. The latter change, but the formerŁ do not ; the man, being presumably intellectual, should diet himself scientifically and on princi-ple. One might well feel sensations of loathing upon perusing the details of a modern civic-banquet, as though human beings were to be stuffed like turkeys, or money was of no further value than to be cast away. Intemperance, of course, is detestable ; but gluttony is a far more glaring and debasing sin. ŠS. Phillips Day. Concerning Medical Matters. [THE following from the American Agricul- turist tells a good deal of truth in a very plain. manner. We are inclined to think, however, that the writer must have been blessed with a family physician much in advance of the great majority of doctors on the subject of drugging. We might also express some doubts about the propriety of cultivating and perpetuating the-confidence in drugs by the use of placebos ; but such a practice is certainly better than poison-ing the patient to death.ŠEn.] A lady in Illinois writes that she sent us. several months ago some recipes that she hadt found exceedingly useful in her family, and wonders that we have not published them. In respect to medical matters we have some very positive opinions, one of which is that there is. far too much medicine taken for the good of the-people, and that, so far as we are concerned, we shall do nothing towards inducing our-readers to dose themselves. Physicians are far in advance of the people in this respect ;, they do not give one-tenth part of the drugs. they did twenty-five years ago, and were it not that their patients would not be satisfied if' they did not "do something," they would give still less than they do now. A sick person needs to have his mind treated as well as his. body, and if he feels that something is being done for him, his mind is at ease, and he-will not fret about himself. So a physician really does him a benefit by leaving some harm-less thing, to be taken in exact doses every few hours, the oftener the better, as it will occupy the mind in looking out for the precise time.. Every physician knows that while the patient's. vie* of his services is confined to the medicine-given, his trouble is to find out exactly what is. the matter, and how far nature is tending to-repair damages. If matters are going on welh enough, and if not interfered with, nature will,
