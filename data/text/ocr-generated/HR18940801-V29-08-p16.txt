A host of mushroom frailties, vices, and foibles break down in the presence of such vigorous growths as the resolution, the endur-ance, and the manly self-reliance engendered by a habit of orderly and energetic action. Justice, fair-ness, and fellow-feeling areŁ developed by the same wholesome training, and thus many a boy at school acquires almost unconsciously that living force of character without which intellect is but a brittle gem. For obvious reasons our public schools have taken a leading part in promoting physical education in this country. The pupils trained in them are, in very many cases, non-resident, and the consequent  responsibility for their bodily health imposed upon teachers who act in loco parentis has no doubt had to do with the formation of a compulsory system of exercise. Administered with due regard to the in-dividual fitness or unfitness, we regard this arrange-ment as beneficial, and we welcome the development of a similar, though naturally somewhat less strin-gent, method in the management of day schools throughout the country. Into the comparative merits of the particular means employed, we cannot now enter. It is enough that the principle which they express is generally admitted, and that those who now administer education are for the most part firmly convinced of its importance as a power to be regulated and employed for the mental as well as the physical well-being of students.Š The Lancet. S BICYCLE RIDING FOR HEALTH.Š Robert J. Roberts, the famous Boston gymnast, makes the following very sensible remarks (Young Men's Magazine) upon the best way of using the bicycle as a mode of exer-cise for health : Š " Bicycling is one of the pleasantest and most beneficial of exercises, if it be practiced with discre-tion. There is no need of trying to ride enough for a half century every day, or even like a streak every time you go out for a constitutional. Why will so many of you sit on your seats like monkeys on a stick, and try to grind your noses off on your front wheel ? All this is wrong, and will only bring discredit on the sport that we love so much. There could no occa-sion arise that would necessitate your sitting on your seat with your back humped up like a camel. If the wind is blowing strong, and you must ride faster for a time, you should bend your body forward at the waist, carry your head well forward and down, yet keep your back straight, and chest out. In this way you will not cut such a ridiculous figure, and deep breathing will not be interfered with. But to be on the safe side, I would advise all who ride a wheel to sit up straight at all times. "A short time ago, when Sanger won his race in such fast time, he was as erect as a pine when he was riding at his fastest speed. Any one exercise carried to excess or even one unvarying routine of daily labor has a strong tendency to pull the body out of shape, to overcome which, and preserve good form, corrective exercises should be taken. This is one important reason why every one needs some kind of body-building work, no matter how hard his work may be. A few health hints  to bicycle riders who wish to gain the most good from riding : Š "ELEVEN DO N'TS TO REMEMBER. " Do n't sit like a monkey on a stick. " Do n't keep your hands close together. " Do n't ride at all times like a streak. " Do n't ride fifty miles every day. "Do n't ride until you feel tired. " Do n't forget to practice corrective work daily. " Do n't forget that back-neck work keeps the head erect. " Do n't ride with low or narrow handle-bars. "Do n't forget to practice the out- and in-door breathing exercises. " Do n't forget that the dry land swim will keep the shoulders back and expand the chest. " Do n't fail to practice the posterior chest weight drill daily, either with the hands, weights, bells, or clubs." SWIMMING.ŠDuring the summer season in the temperate zones, and at all seasons in the tropical regions, where a body of clear water is accessible, swimming may be usefully employed as one of the most healthful and advantageous forms of exercise. Swimming brings into activity all the muscles of the body as thoroughly as can any gymnastic movement. It encourages lung development, and the circum-stances under which the exercise is taken insure per-fect freedom of activity for every organ. Swimming is to be commended, especially for young women, as a means by which they may an-tagonize the evil consequences of the wearing of 41-
