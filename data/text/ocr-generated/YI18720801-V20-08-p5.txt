THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 61 again. I know you will be pleased to learn this, and if you read the Bible you will find it says so. I hope you study its sacred pages and com-mit verses to inemory. There are many which tell about the new-earth home. It may be you have seen many beautiful homes here, where everything that wealth could purchase and ingenuity invent abounded; but that home will be far more beautiful than any you have ever seen, and whatever is lovely here, fire may destroy or death re-move. Isa. 64 : 4 reads, " For since the begin-ning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, 0 God, beside thee, what he hath pre-pared for him that waiteth for him." So you see we cannot even think how much of beauty and happiness our kind Heavenly Father has reserved for those who serve him. But the verse reads, "For him that waiteth for him." We must get ready before we can wait, and I fear we are not ready yet. Rev. 22:14 tells us how we may get into that lovely place. " Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city!' If you read the Bible through you will not find one bless-ing pronounced on those who do not keep his commandments. In 1 John 5 : 3, we read, "For this is the love of God, if we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous." So we must not only keep them, but do it cheerfully because we love to. If they are grievous to us, we do not love God, and he will take no one to live with him who does not love him. But Jesus will come before you grow old, Then give your hearts to him now, And when you shall enter the city of gold, He'll place a crown on your brow. MARY MARTIN. New Ilumpshire. Decay. WE hear many speak of decay in the world through which we are passing, of de-cline, and loss, and change in such rapid succession that we can almost catch the sound of universal wasting, and hear the work of desolation going on busily around us. The flowers bloom and fade, the rocks crumble, the trees fall, and the grass with-ers. The clouds rise, and soon pass away. If we turn to our friends, it is but a short time that we are with them, and they bid us farewell. We see them for a few moments, and a few moments more their countenances are changed, and they pass away. It mat-ters not how near and dear they are. The ties which bind us together are never too close to be parted, or too strong to be broken. Our friends all elude our grasp, and pass away. We can have no confidence, then, no feel-ing of security, by turning to our cotempo-raries and kindred. We know that those around us will soon pass away. If everything that we see or hear has en-dured for so short a time, and soon will be no more, we cannot receive the least assur-ance of safety by thinking on ourselves. When a few more friends have left, and a few more hopes deceived, and a few more changes met us, we shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. All power will have forsaken the strongest, and the loftiest will be laid low, every eye will be closed, and every voice hushed, every heart will cease to beat. And when we have all passed away, we soon shall be re-membered no more. A stone, perhaps, may tell some wanderer where we lie, when we came, and when we  passed away ; but even that will soon refuse to bear us record. " Time's effacing finger " will be busy on its surface, and at length will wear it smooth; and soon the stone will crumble and fall; and in the memory of oth-ers we shall soon pass away. Though all earthly things pass away, yet there is one Being to whom we can look with perfect confidence and find that secur-ity which no other can give, and no one can take away. To this Being we can lift up our souls, ex-claiming, "Of old thou hast laid the founda-tions of the earth, and all that is therein are the work of thy hand. They shall perish, but thou shalt be forever." Here is a great support which will never fail. We can look toward God, and be as-sured he will never forget us, and at the res-urrection morning we shall be caught up and changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, to be forever with the Lord. ADDIS E. WELCH. Battle Creek. WORK FOR LITTLE HEARTS AND HANDS. LITTLE bands can be useful, Helping the worn and weary, Little faces be bright and cheerful, To comfort the sad and dreary. Little hearts can be thankful For the blessings God has given, Little lips can be sweetly lisping Prayers to the God of Heaven. Little eyes can be seeking Some work for the willing fingers; Little ears to the truth can listen, While the day of mercy lingers. Little children the Saviour calls, In his tender love and pity; He will carry the lambs of the fold In his arms to the beautiful city. R. O. BAKER. How a Skylark Preached a Sermon. STORIES, as well as poems, about the sky-lark abound ; but the following story shows the constant love of Englishmen for this truly English bird. There is no such thing as a song-bird natural to Australia ; there are birds that chatter, and birds that shriek, but no bird that sings. Well, there was a young man who went out from England as a gold-digger, and was fortunate enough to make some money, and prudent enough to take care of it. He opened a "store " (a sort of rough shop, where almost anything could be had) at a place called " The Ovens," a noted gold-field about two hundred miles from Melbourne. As he continued to pros-per, this young man, like a dutiful son, wrote home for his father and mother, ask-ing them to come out to' him, and, if they possibly could, to bring with them a lark. The old folks agreed, and in due time, with a lark in charge, they took ship and left the shores of England. His father, however, took the change so much to heart that he died ; but his mother and the lark landed in sound health at Melbourne, and were speedily forwarded to Mr. Wilsted's store at " The Ovens." It was on Tuesday when they arrived, and the next morning the lark was hung outside the hut, and at once began piping up. The effect was wonderful. Sturdy diggersŠbig men with great brown handsŠpaused in the midst of their work and listened reverently. Drunken diggers left unfinished the blas-phemous sentence, and looked bewildered and ashamed. Far and near the news spread  rapidly : " Have you heard the lark ?" Is it true, mate, that there is a real English skylark up at Jack Wilsted's ?" So it went on for three days, and then came Sunday morning. Such a sight had not been seen since the first spadeful of the golden earth had been turned ! From every quarterŠeast, west, north, and southŠfrom far-off hill, and from creeks twenty miles away, came a steady stream of rough, brawny Englishmen, all brushed and washed as decent as possible. The movement was not arranged beforehand, as was plain from the half-ashamed expression of every man's face as he met his acquaintance in the crowd. There they were, however, and their errand wasŠto hear the lark ! Nor were they disappointed. There, perched in his wood-and-iron pulpit, was the little minis-ter, and, as if he knew the importance of the task before him, he plumed his crest, and, lifting up his voice, sang them a ser-mon, which touched his audience more closely than perhaps even the bishop him-self could have done. It was a wonderful sight to see those three or four hundred men, some lying on the ground, some sitting with their arms on their knees, and their heads on their hands, some leaning against the trees, with their eyes closed, so that they might the better fancy themselves at home, and in the midst of English cornfields once more ; but, whether sitting, standing, or lying, all were equally quiet and attentive; and when, after an hour's steady preaching, the lark ceased, his audience suddenly started off, a little lowspirited, perhap4, but on the whole happier than when they came. Yes, and doubtless in many a broast the lark's warble had stirred the memories of the les-sons learned in the village school, or in the village church at home, and had wakened unuttered longings for those " means of grace " for which they had cared so little when they were within their reach. So the skylark preached his sermon, and many of his congregation wished that they could have taken him away with them, to preach to them in their distant diggings day by day. " I say, Joe," one digger was heard to say to another, " do you think Wilsted would sell himŠthe bird, you know ? I'll give as much gold-dust for him as he weighs, and think him cheap." " Sell him ! not he !" was the indignant answer; "how would you like a fellow to come to our village at home, and make a bid for our parson ? "Š Abridged" from " Some Pets." MALL THINGS.ŠA beautiful boy lay dead, and his heart-broken parents were weeping over his cold body. Many friends gathered round with words of pity. Among them was a poor old woman who bad received much kindness from the family. She wiped the tears from her withered face, and said to the mother, " Oh he was so good and kind. How few young gentlemen would have come, as he did, last winter, in the deep snow, to split wood for an old woman 1 How beauti-ful and humble he came at your bidding !" "It was not at my bidding !" replied the mother, "but at the promptings of his own noble heart, that he did that thing." God, no doubt, accepted that little deed, and the memory of the dear boy remained in more than one heart when he was laid in the dust.
