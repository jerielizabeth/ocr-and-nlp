BLESSED Jesus, kind and mild, Stoop to hear a little child : At thy feet I come.to pray ; Saviour, cast me not away. Take away my load of sin, Make me clean and pure within ; Teach me all I need to know, Be my Shepherd here below. In my childhood may I be Gentle, meek, and pure like thee; Help me every sin to leave, Lest thy loving heart I grieve. Tender Jesus, thou didst call To thine arms the children small; Lo, I come, and humbly pray, Cast me not from thee away. For the Youth's Instructor. Incidents in My Past Life.

Y last closed with the conference in the city of Lowel, Mass. The history of the fall of the Ottoman Supremacy will be found in J. Litch's Prophetic Expositions, Vol. ii, pages 181-200. On pages 198 and 199 is the sum-ming up of his conclusive argument, showing how clearly the prophecy in Rev. ix, 13-15 was ful-filled on the 11th of August 1840. On pages 189 and 190 will be found the reliable testimony of an eye witness, who states facts to prove the same point, seemingly without any knowledge of the prophecy, or Litch's exposition of it. Here it is: " The following is from Rev. Mr. GoOdell, mis-sionary of the American Board at Constantinople, addressed to the Board, and by them published in the Missionary Herald, for April 1841," p. 160Š " The power of Islamism is broken forever; and there is no concealing the fact even from themselves. They exist now by mere sufferance. And though there is a mighty effort made by the Christian gov-ernments to sustain them, yet at every step they sink lower and lower with fearful velocity. And though there is a great endeavor made to graft the institutions of civilized and Christian countries up- on the decayed trunk, yet the very root itself is fast wasting away by the venom of its own poison. How wonderful it is, that, when all christendom com-bined together to check the progress of Mohamme-dan power, it waxed exceedingly great in spite of every opposition; and now when all the mighty potentates of Christian Europe, who feel fully com-petent to settle all the quarrels, and arrange the af-fairs of the whole world, are leagued together for its protection and defence, down it comes, in spite of all their fostering care." These astounding facts prove that the prophecy of the sounding of the sixth angel for three hun-dred and ninety-one years and fifteen days, ended on the 11th day of August, 1840, and at the same time the second woe passed, and behold the third woe cometh quickly. Mark, this short space of time called "quick-ly," is the whole period of time from the passing of the second woe and sixth angel, to the commencing of the third woe, and sounding of the seventh angel. This space of time called quickly, defines the time to announce to every nation and kindred and tongue and people that Christ is coming, by the proclamation of the angel's message in Rev. xiv, 6, 7. This is in accordance with the testimony of the Saviour, Matt. xxiv, 3, 14. No marvel, then, that those who had been look-ing with intense anxiety for the passing away of the Ottoman supremacy, saw with such clearness that the time had come for a body of people to pro-claim the message in question from thence down to the ending of the prophetic periods of Daniel's vis-ion. And that the time had then come for this message to go to every nation, was still further demonstrated by a call for a Second Advent con-ference to be held in Boston about the time the Ot-toman empire lost its supremacy, and many weeks before the news of its fall reached the United States. At the close of this conference, which was convened a few weeks after the call, in October, 1840, an address of the conference setting forth their views respecting the second advent of our Lord, was sent forth to the world, and from thence the work continued until the message ended in the Fall of 1844. Opposition from various quarters was now being made manifest, nevertheless the cause was hourly increasing. In October, 1841, the third conference was held in Portland, Maine, which gave a new im-pulse to the cause in that section of country. Con-
