St AMONG the many pleasant and distinguished guests of the Sanitarium the present season are to be found Col. Haldeman, of Kentucky, proprietor of the Louisville Courier-journal, with his wife and daughter, and other members of his family, the 'editor and publisher of the Inter-Ocean, with his wife and sons and daughters, and Judge Armstrong, of Lexington, Ky. It is seldom that we find at the Sanitarium a more intelligent, agree-able, and contented family of guests than at the present time. * * * THE Sanitarium medical corps has recently been strongly re-inforced by the arrival of a number of physicians who, after having spent several years under Sanitarium training and study, have recently graduated at medical colleges. Ten or more of these new physicians are now taking post-graduate studies at the Sanitarium, at the same time assisting in the various branches of medical work, so that the present medical corps reaches nearly twenty graduated physicians, 1  esides more than a dozen medical students and over two hundred nurses. There is probably no place in the world where a sick person requiring careful attention can receive so much thoughtful and intelligent care as at this in-stitution. * * * SMALLPDX AND MEASLES IN OHIO, PROBABLY CONTRACTED AT MERCHANT'S HOTEL, DETROIT.Š It will be remembered that Miss Leonard died at the Merchant's Hotel, Detroit, June 6, 1894. Dr. Cleland had reported the case as measles, but the fact developed that she died of smallpox. The Secretary of the Michigan State Board of Health is informed that Henry Mc Gale left Lenawee Junction, in Palmyra township, Lenawee county, Michigan, about June 5, 1894, and stopped that night and the following night at the Merchant's  Hotel, in Detroit. He reached Luckey, Ohio, June 7, and developed smallpox June 22 or 23. The Secretary of the Ohio State Board of Health, in speaking of Mc Gale, says : " This pa-tient had measles within a week after coming to Luckey, and within another week was taken with smallpox. There were three children in the family in which he was staying, and I saw them when two of them had a well-marked case of measles, while the third had both measles and the eruption of smallpox at one and the same time. This child had a well-marked case of smallpox, and his two brothers have within the last day or two contracted smallpox from him." From the foregoing, it may be inferred that Mc Gale contracted both diseases, measles and small-pox, at the same place, Š the Merchant's Hotel, Detroit. The period of incubation appears to have been slightly less in the cases of measles than in the cases of smallpox. Probably the reason why Dr. Cleland overlooked the smallpox was because it supervened upon a well-marked case of measles. HENRY B. BAKER. Office of the Secretary of the Michigan State Board of Health, Lansing, Michigan, July 30, 1894. * * THE new dress catalogue, issued by the Sanitarium Electrical Supply Co., marks a great step in advance in solving the problem of healthful dress for women. The numerous cuts with which the pamphlet is illustrated present the subject of healthful dress in a manner calculated to arrest the attention of the most indif-ferent, and demonstrate the fact that a dress may be at the same time in perfect accord with the highest requirements of art and with the strictest principles of hygiene. Those who are interested in the question of healthful dress for women should send a pos-tage stamp to the Sanitarium Electrical Supply Co., Battle Creek, Mich., for a copy of the new catalogue above referred to.
