Some time since, a gentleman of considerable wealth and notoriety in New York city, con-tributed to one of the city papers an article in support of the last-mentioned theory. This gentleman was exceedingly fond of the canine race, and spent large sums of money in collect-ing dogs of various breeds and colors. Being an enthusiastic believer in his theory, he of course took no precautions to prevent the occurrence of hydrophobia. A few weeks ago he was bitten by one of his dogs, and he has since died with all the symptoms of the disease known as rabies or hydrophobia. This seemed to be conclusive evidence that his theory was erroneous. Since the death of this gentleman, a man by the name of McCormick has also died, appar-ently as the result of being bitten by a mad dog. He also gave every symptom of the dis-ease, and his case was firmly believed to be an indisputable instance of hydrophobia. Hitherto all attempts to discover any structural lesions as the result of this disease have been without success. In this case, the coroner's jury was made up of the most scientific physicians of the city, who made a very minute post-mortem ex-amination. The medulla oblongata, the great nerve center at the upper portion of the spinal cord, was carefully removed, and after being kept in alcohol for some time, was pronounced to be in excellent condition for examination. The famous Dr. Hammond then proceeded to cut it into little bits and examine it with the aid of a powerful microscope. Very soon the result of this very scientific investigation was announced by Dr. Hammond, who claimed that he had discovered the long sought lesion. Diagrams of thin slices of the medulla oblongata in which little black specks could be seen, were published in the news-papers. These minute specks were said to be extravasated blood which had been poured out as the result of the disease. The modus operandi of the matter was said to be this : The poison entered the system through a bite upon the hand of the patient. The learned doctor traced its course from that point to the great center of the nervous system, the medulla, where it all centered, having a special affinity for that part, and by inducing a violent inflammation of that organ the patient's life was destroyed. During the interval between the bite and the patient's death,  as was said by the same doctor, the poison was working about the system (probably  searching for the lacdulla), especially in the brain, making the patient say a great many strange things about mad dogs. This was considered one of the most wonder-ful triumphs of modern scientific medicine..  Looking at the matter from the standpoint of a correct theory of disease, we can see no good grounds for any positive conclusion whatever with reference to the disease in question. The medulla oblongata did seem to be affected, both from the symptoms of the disease and from the post-mortem appearance ; but this was evidence that there had been morbid action of the organ, and not that the virus of the mad dog had been attacking it. But that which places this wonderful discov-ery in a very ludicrous light is the fact that the dog which bit the patient, and which was sup-posed to be rabid, is still living, and has as≈Å good a prospect of life as other dogs, it now appearing that he has never had hydrophobia. Now what about the poison that entered poor McCormick's hand and made such a murder-ous assault upon his medulla ? Who will rise to explain ? We are afraid that our medical savants with all their acknowledged wisdom are as much in the fog as ever concerning the nature of hydrophobia, although they do seem to be learning something of disease in general. Personal Cleanliness. "CLEANLINESS is next to godliness," is a very old adage, the general belief in which by civilized nations is attested by the enormous quantities of soap annually employed for deter-gent purposes. The use of soap seems to be con-fined wholly to civilization; hence, a noted writer tells us that the degree of a nation's civilization may be determined by the amount of soap which it uses. This evident incompatibility of dirt with refinement and culture is certainly very natural and desirable, and the old adage referred to is by no means to be despised ; but if we might have the privilege of so amending it as to make it accord with our own sentiments, we would make it read, Cleanliness is a part of godliness. Possibly it is not the most essential constituent, may be it is more of an auxiliary than primary virtue ; but we are firmly convinced that god-liness is very incomplete without it. Indeed, personal cleanliness is one of the most promi-nent articles of a Mohammedan's creed. Dirt is, simply, matter out of place. The
