Constipation of the Bowels.ŠA Western correspondent, who is a traveling man and greatly troubled with constipation, asks for sug-gestions. Ans. Inactivity of the bowels may be due to any one of several causes. One of the most com-mon causes is a torpid state of the liver. In cases in which the stool is hard and dry, the im-mediate cause is deficiency of secretion on the part of the intestinal mucous membrane. The following suggestions will be found helpful: 1. Eat coarse food, such as cracked wheat, peas, beans, vegetables, etc. Avoid meat and condi-ments, tea, coffee, fats, pastry, and all unwhole-some articles of food. 2. Drink two to four pints of water daily. The water should be taken an hour before the meal, and not within two hours after. 3. Wear at night a wet abdominal bandage, consisting of a towel wrung out of cold water dry enough so it will not drip, and cov-ered with several thicknesses of dry flannel. The towel should be long enough to go around the body two or three times. It should be taken off in the morning, and the surface of the body rubbed for a while with the hand dipped in cold water. Two or three times a day knead and percuss the bowels with the hands for five or ten minutes very thoroughly. If these measures are not effective after a month's trial, please report, and other suggestions will be made. What to Do in Case of Poisoning.ŠE. P. E. wishes to get directimis what to do in case of ac- cidental poisoning. Ans. As a rule the first thing to do in case of poisoning is to secure vomiting, as the proper antidote is not always immediately at hand. This may be done by means of common salt, or better, by the use of mustard. A tablespoonful of mustard in a glass of water will generally se-cure a prompt emesis. A teaspoonful of com-mon salt in a glass of warm water is also very ef-fective. Poisons which produce insensibility may be successfully antagonized, in many cases, by hot and cold applications to the spine and general surface of the body. Many poisons  have special antidotes, which should be known, and administered in each case. Will publish in future numbers some of the best known anti-dotes for common poisoning. See "Accidental Poisoning " on page 249. ElectricityŠMassage.ŠA correspondent in-quires whether we approve of the use of elec-tricity for an individual suffering with con-sumption, who has occasional hemorrhages, and if it may be self applied. Wishes also to know the meaning of " massage." Ans. Electricity is often very advantageous as a remedy in cases of consumption. Its chief value in these cases is through its use as a tonic, and as a form of exercise by which the muscles of the chest may be strengthened. The methods of application of this remedial agent, together with the other mentioned remedy, are fully ex-plained in the Home Hand-Book, .a copy of which the querist might profitably peruse if he wishes to become thoroughly acquainted with hygiene, and the rational methods of treating disease. A good battery for home use may be obtained by addressing the Sanitarium, Battle Creek, Mich. Lemons Š Cold Water - Drinking Š Slow Digestion.ŠA patient inquires as follows : 1. Is the free use of lemons in any way injurious to health? 2. Why are lemons considered ben-eficial in cases of rheumatism, and other fruits injurious? 3. Is it necessary to health to drink cold water occasionally, while one is in the habit of freely using hot water as a drink? 4. Should a person in usual health, but with slow digestion, eat the second meal before the stomach seems empty, that is, before he feels hungry? Ans. 1. No. Persons in ordinary health, as a rule, can take lemons freely. The beat guide to their use is appetite. Those who have a crav-ing for acid fruits of some kind, usually find the use of lemons advantageous. 2. We are not aware that this is the case as re-gards all other fruits. In cases of rheumatism, those fruits are injurious which the individual is unable to digest. When the urine is strongly acid, and a copious brick-dust sediment is pres-ent, raw acid fruits ought, as a rule, to be avoided, as they disagree with the stomach, pro-ducing acid indigestion, and, as a result, increase the amount of acid in the blood. 3. No. 4. As a rule, the work of digesting one meal should be completed before another is taken. It is not always easy to determine when the food is passed from the stomach. Frequently, when a person is suffering with very slow di-gestion,Šthree to four hours being required for the foo to reach that stage of digestion where it leaves the stomach,Štwo or three glasses of hot water taken one or two hours before a meal will facilitate the emptying of the stomach, and make it ready for the succeeding meal.
