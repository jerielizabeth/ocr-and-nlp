We pray that in the year to come Your trust may be in Him Whose promises will never fail, Whose love will never dim ; That in his service you may find The purest peace and joy, That happiness which he alone Can give without alloy ; That you may be the blessed means Of leading to his feet The ones whom you love most on earth. Ah ! privilege most sweet ! That he who colors fairest flowers, And perfumes every breath, May color all thy life for thee, And sweeten even death ! 4RS. F. A. REYNOLDS. FEBRUARY 21, 1895. THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 63 OUR LANGUAGE. IN SEVEN PARTS.ŠPART VI. Its Derivation. MANY of the languages and dialects spoken in the world have contributed to the richness of the English vocabulary. As two thirds of our dictionary words are derived from the Greek and Latin, it is contended by some that it is more closely related to them than to the Teutonic languages, but its grammatical con- structions are Saxon. English could exist as a language without the aid of foreign terms, but these alone would not express our ideas without Saxon words. A few of the words from the Saxon that are of the greatest importance to us are the arti-cles, " a," " an," and " the " ; our pronouns ; most of our adjectives ; the adverbs in com-mon use ; nearly all of our irregular verbs, auxiliaries, prepositions, and conjunctions. The term " color " is derived from the Latin, but it is from the Saxon that we receive names for the different colors, as white, black, red, brown, green, etc. Also the verb " to move " has the same derivation ; but the dif-ferent kinds of motion,Š walking, running, jumping, etc.,Šare of Saxon origin. From the latter tongue we receive our words which ex-press the emotions of the mind, as " love," " hope," and '' fear " ; " smile " and " tear," " father " and " mother," " brother " and " sister," also the common terms used on the farm, in the market, and in the shop, are from the Saxon. Take from our vocabulary the words which have been named, and we would be at a loss to express the common thoughts of every-day life. The following gives the percentage of Saxon words in the Bible and some of our classical works : " The Bible shows the largest propor-tion of Teutonic words, seventy-eight per cent; the poetry of Bryant and Halleck, seventy-seven per cent ; of Byron, seventy-six per cent ; of Tennyson, seventy-one per cent ; of Longfellow, seventy-three per cent ; of Shake-speare, sixty-two per cent ; Milton, Pope, and Dryden, sixty-one per cent ; Hume and Hallam employ fifty-two per cent of Saxon words, while the percentage in the Constitu-tion of the United States and in Robertson's History of America, is thirty-six and thirty-five respectively." From the fact that our language came from so many sources, it abounds in words which have the same meaning, or nearly the same. Such words are said to be synonymous ; but while the significance may be nearly the same, most of them have a shade of difference in meaning. Like any language that partakes of the nature of so many different ones, ours is full of irregularities. " We must not expect entire consistency in its parts, or that complete analogy of structure which is found in simpler tongues, that have been built on_ but one foundation." A. R. WILcox. ENGLISH RAGGED SCHOOLS. AMERICANS who visit the by-streets and by-ways of London now gain a very poor idea of the street-rovers and urchins as they were fifty years ago. The late Mr. Spurgeon, when a boy, was greatly stirred in soul by the descrip-tions of life in the by-ways of London, which then appeared in " Household Words." It is difficult for Americans to grasp the condition of these districts. Consider, for a moment, what New York, Philadelphia, Chi-cago, and other large cities would be without our public schools. Think of the large dis-tricts given over to squalor and poverty not only, but to utter ignorance. Here were not only some but all the children neglected, their only playground and only school the narrow, filthy streets, with their gutters reeking with filth. With our long familiarity with free public schools in America, it surprises us to read that such schools in Great Britain were then re-garded as impracticable and chimerical. The dense ignorance of the lower classes, and the manifest failure of all efforts to better their condition without religion and education, led a few philanthropists, with the late Lord Shaftesbury at their head, to start the Ragged-School movement. This aimed to provide in-struction for the poorest classes, or for those unable to pay for it at the only schools then existing. The children were ragged, neglected, but full of life and fun. They loved and lived in adventure. School life was a great novelty. It offered the rude youngsters a fine chance for a "lark." Such tricks as suddenly to turn out the lights, leaving the classes in total dark-ness, producing bedlam, or to dive between the teacher's legs when he was bending over a pupil, so as to cause him to turn a summer-sault, and other freaks, were common games. The nickname " Ragged School " was given to the first experiment of teaching the street-rov-ers of Field Lane, in a report printed in the London Times. When an effort was made to interest the English Parliament in the movement, it encoun-tered a full tide of opposition and ridicule. The government was very slow to perceive that it had any obligations to help such of its subjects as could not help themselves to a rudimentary education. But the earnest and dogged energy of a few noble men prevailed. Thousands of young urchins were reclaimed ; great numbers were aided to emigrate to the colonies or to America, and the government finally recognized the importance of caring for the poor, to keep, them from vice and crime. Out of this success has come the government school system of Great Britain, which now brings education fairly within the reach of all. The literature of these schools is interesting. Among the earliest contributors to it was "Old Humphrey," veryŁ popular half a century ago, and later Rob Roy (John Macgregor) was an  enthusiast for Ragged Schools. He contrib-uted largely to the solution of the problem of employment for the boys by establishing the Boy's Shoeblack Brigades, that earned about five thousand dollars a month in the London streets. Lord Shaftesbury used to claim that three hundred thousand young persons had been saved from lapsing into crime by the Ragged-School movement. Now the Ragged School Union finds that the Board (public govern-ment) schools educate the poor. So it has turned its attention to the support of Sunday-schools and Bible-classes, maintaining about two hundred schools, with about fifty thousand young people in them. It has institute build-ings, with gymnasium, technical and industrial classes during the week, establishes penny sav-ings banks, and in other ways fosters habits of industry and thrift. It provides visitors for the sick, aged, and afflicted, gospel services and open-air preaching for the careless and irreligious, and in multitudes of ways brings helpful influences to keep the poor and wretched from extreme suffering and despair. It could well celebrate the year just passed as its jubilee year, with joy and thanksgiving.ŠSelected. ACCEPTED OR REFUSED? IN TWO PARTS. ŠPART II. To those of you who have accepted Christ as your own dear Saviour, and who are striving to walk in all God's commandments and ordi-nances blamelessly, I. would say, My brother, my sister, be often alone with God. Let not a day pass without secret prayer. Satan knows that his time is short, and he is watching the more closely, that he may, if possible, yet gain a foothold before it is too late. You need always to be in such intimate connection with your Saviour that his blessed Spirit can warn you of Satan's devices before you are en-tangled by them. Cultivate and keep a firm trust in Jesus, and he will carry you safely through unto the end. Ask him for daily blessings. One day at a time is all the dear Lord has bidden you live in this world. If you live to-day under the shadow of his wing, whep the shades of night draw around you, you can lie down in peace, knowing that his angels will keep strict watch by your pillow ; and if to-morrow comes to you, seek the Lord's help for one more day. Thus the Christian's life is made up of daily trusting and doing ; for trusting alone, or do-ing alone, will never take you to heaven. We are commanded to " work while it is day," and to be " diligent in business," " serving the Lord." Your work is to be faithful in the place you are called to occupy, trusting in the Lord for wisdom and strength to do right in all things. But be sure not to trust to self, not even for one moment ; for that would place you on Satan's ground. You would have to let go of the arm of the Lord, and would assuredly fall spiritually, just as much as you would bodily if you were crossing a stream on a narrow plank, with your father, and you should step off the plank, and let go of his hand, too. It would prove a fatal step. May the blessing of God rest upon all the readers of the INSTRUCTOR, to keep you from falling and make you valiant for the Lord, " ready to every good work." MRS. JULIA LOOMIS. MODESTY is praiseworthy, because it seeks no praise. NOT all food is nutriment to all.
