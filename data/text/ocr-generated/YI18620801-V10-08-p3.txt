E know of nothing more essential than per- severance, for without it we may despair of success in any undertaking here or here- after. This qualification is not so much needed where everything is inviting us forward, but rather, where something at every step arrays itself to oppose, and drive us from our purpose. To il-lustrate I will tell you of a little girl away down among the hills and valleys of Ohio, who I think possessed this trait of character to some degree, at least. Her mother had been sent for upon an occasion of sickness or death, and as the journey was to be performed on horse-back, the little girl was mount-ed on " old Bol," and dispatched to the neighbors for a side-saddle. She had proceeded but a little way when down went Bolly flat to the ground ; however the child was fortunate enough to alight on her feet, and she stood holding the bridle, hardly know-ing whether he had killed himself or not, he lay so motionless. To assure herself on this point— she tried the effect of whipping him, saying, " Get up, Bolly !" and after quite &struggle and many efforts, he arose to his feet all right. She knowing the reason he fell down, feared to get on his back again, and so went on leading him. He was an un-profitable animal at best, not even earning his board, much less his shoesŠconsequently was unshod, which made it very difficult standing on the icy hillside, for the road was everywhere a glare of ice. Presently she came to another difficulty worse than the first, which, for the time, seemed to baffle her completely. A brook ran across the road, which had spread some width from the recent rain, then froze over before it ran away, leaving a covering of ice which must have been disagreeable to the bare feet of the animal. When he was led to:its edge he absolutely refused to go any further, and when urged to proceed, would pull back with great violence. Her efforts to get the horse over were repeated again and again to no purpose, and not knowing what next to do, she burst into tears. She thought how her mother would be disappointed if she failed of getting the saddle. While in this dilem-ma, it occurred to her mind that there was one means yet untried. Quick as thought she whirled him round as if intending to urge him in an oppo-site direction ; but he with his obstinate persever-ance kept pulling back as before, and ere he was aware had backed himself over the difficult place. It can truly be said of this brave little girl, who had exhibited in this instance the wisdom of the serpent, that she went on her way rejoicing, did her errand, and returned home without any more trouble. So much for her perseverance. That little girl has since grown up, and is trying to be  a  Christian, and it is by the continued exer- if s et, For the Youth's Instructor. Do you Thank God? OD has given you life and health and all things ; do you think of him and try to please him ? A friend makes you a present which is useful and beautiful, and whenever you see this present it reminds you of the friend who gave it to you. You have hands to work with ; you can see and hear and understand. See how inconvenient it is for the blind to walk about ; how unhappy it is for those who are deaf, when their friends converse, to see the satisfaction others are having who hear all that is said, while they are shut out from the world by this infirmity. And when you see how pleasant it is to have all these gifts, do you thank God for them? As you look abroad upon God's works, when you look upon the beauties of spring, the glories of summer, the fullness of autumn, and upon the snows of winter ; when you hear the songs of the birds, the bleating of the flocks, the lowing of the herds, and when you hear the mild breezes as they rustle among the leafy trees, or the winds as they stir the mighty waves, or bend the lofty forests, do you thank God for ears to hear and eyes to see ? As you listen to those who tell you of heaven, and its glories, or as you hear the beautiful songs of those who sing of coming deliverance, does this lead you to think of Him who gave you the gift of hearing? or as you look with pleasure upon your friends and teachers, as you look upon the Instruc-tor and hold it before you, and read its useful and interesting pages, do you think of Him who gave you hands and eyes and ears ? Look upon the idiot; can he think and reason as you can, and appreciate what he hears, and sift the wise saying from the foolish one ? And as you med-itate deliberately, and consider and ponder, do you think of Him who gave you this faculty ? Would you be ashamed of the friendship of Queen Victoria? Yet some children are ashamed of Jesus who is King of kings. We have very many reasons for gratitude to God ; all nature around invites us to think of him who covered the earth with his glory. When we consid-er ourselves and all the gifts and powers he has giv-en us, we have much to call us to praise his name. Still greater is the motive to praise him, that there is soon a time coming when God's people will enter upon a life which has no pain, or sbrrow, or sin, or want. Is it too high for children to look forward to that glorious land ? I think not. Jos EPH CLARKE.
