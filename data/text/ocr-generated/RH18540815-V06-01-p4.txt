4 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. Stowe. Social meetings were interesting. On First-day about 600 assembled at Su ton, and 400 at Stowe. The people gave the bes4 attention to the word preached. Bre. J. Hart who goes with the Tent, has taken much responsibility and labor upon himself; but it will be a pleasure to all true believers to help him bear this burden. Youth's Instructor. WHEN we commenced the publication of the IN-STRUCTOR, we intended to furnish original Sabbath-school Lessons, one for each week in the year. This we did do for several months; but poor health, and other duties obliged us to give them up. We then gave the best Lessons we could select from other works, but found it exceeding difficult to find a series of Lessons suited to the present wants of the youth. We feared the resultŠthat the children would lose their interest in their little paperŠthat the Sabbath School in some places might be given up. We have not lost our interest for the religious instruction and salvation of the youth, and feel resolved to do our duty in this department. Bro. R. F. Cottrell has undertaken the work of preparing Sabbath-school Lessons. Four of them are given in No. 8 of the INSTRUCTOR. They are ex-cellent. They contain sound reasoning from plain scripture testimony, and at the same time are sim-plified and brought to the capacity of children. Their value cannot be estimated. It is hoped that none of our readers who are pa-rents or guardians of children, will withhold from them this means of instruction,which they can have for only 25 cents a yearŠfree to the poor. Sabbath Schools should at once be commenced where there are none. Volume II is two-thirds completed, and many have field. The traveler interrupts more people in their sanctification of holy time, and places his bad exam-ple before a greater number of observers, than the man who labors in the field. If to ail this it should be replied, "It is a general practice, and therefore ought to be tolerated," let me beg of you to read Ex. xxiii, 2: " Thou shalt not fol-low a multitude to do evil." The greater the num-ber who are in this practice, and the more the custom has become, as it were, a law, the more alarm ought to be excited. When the most evident transgressions of God's law are sanctioned by general custom, then may we expect to hear the holy One of Israel say, "Shall not I visit for these things, and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this. ?" THE REVIEW AND HERALD "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.'  ROCHESTER THIRD-DAY, AUG. 15,1854, The Review, WE commence the sixth volume of the Rex law with encouraging prospects. Its friends are gradually increasing; and we think they may safely expect that this volume will exceed those before it in inter-est. We hope to be able to give valuable articles from different brethren on the all-important subjects connected with the Christian's hope and duty, such as the Atonement, the Advent, Immortality alone through Christ, the Law of God and Bible holiness, together with communications from brethren and sisters, giving the state of the cause in the different parts of the field, and also personal experience. Speak often one to another, brethren, of your faith, hope, trials and joys, through the REVIEW. This adds life and interest to it for very many. This is the best time to obtain subscribers. Those desirous of extending the knowledge of the truth will please obtain subscribers for the REVIEW. We shall send back Nos. to all new subscribers for a few weeks, unless ordered to do otherwise. The receipts this week show the readiness of not a few to pay for this volume in advance. In order that we may meet our expenses, and publish the Hymn Book and other works in contemplation, all our readers will please follow the example set them in this number. Each church should look after their poor, and see that their papers are paid for. Agents will please collect money for the REVIEW, and forward it by Mail at our risk, unless the sum exceeds fifteen dollars; in that case they may obtain drafts at our expense, payable to our order. Vermont Tent. THE brethren in Vermont have found it difficult to get access to the people, especially in the busy season. Meeting-houses and many school-houses have been closed against them. They therefore concluded to obtain a Tent for the accommodation of those who might wish to hear the reasons of our faith and hope. "He that hath an ear, let him hear ; " but how can they hear without a preacher, and a suitable place to assemble :2  The present prospect is, that this effort will prove a blessing to the cause. Thousands will have a chance to hear, whether they are benefited or not, who would not come within the sound of the voice of truth, were it not for attending a Tent Meeting. But we have the best of reasons to expect that conviction will fasten upon the hearts of many, that will follow them till they embrace the truth. We had the pleasure of attending their first Tent Meeting at Waitsfield. The circumstances were most unfavorable, it being the first attempt, in the midst of the haying season. There was quite a col-lection of believers on the Sabbath, and on First-day about 500 assembled to hear the word. It was in-deed a free place to speak, and we judge that many present were satisfied that we had the truth, on the Sabbath question at least. Several preaching breth-ren were present, and took part in the services of the meeting. We also attended the Tent Meetings at Sutton and  forgotten (perhaps) to pay for it. Our terms are, " In advance, or within three months." If more convenient, send us 8 letter stamps. Will traveling brethren, agents and friends interest themselves in the circulation of the INSTRUCTOR. jr;'' This No. has been necessarily delayed. We design that the Review for the future shall be mailed on the second day of each week. PROVED B t BUTLER'S CATECHISM. NOT long since, during an interview with a Papist, he made a statement of what he regarded as being the true definition of the word, soul, and of what he believed would be its condition after death, and after the judgment. These views did not differ materially from the popular theology of the, day. In vindication of which, he added, "And if you have read Butler's Catechism, you have found it there." 1 remarked that the Bible did not endorse such sentiments. "I know that" said he, " neither can you prove the Trin-ity from the Bible," Here then, thus far, we have an acknowledgment or confession of the faith of the Itoinisli Church, for which its advocate laid no claim to any scriptural proof. Neither do Romanists regard the Bible as a sufficient rule of faith. But contrariwise: " The Bible does not contain all things necessary to salva-tion, and, consequently, can not be a sufficient rule of faith." Sure Way. The following we take from Butler's Catechism. " Ques. Where shall we find the truths God has taught " Ans. They are chiefly contained in the Apostles' creed. "Q. What do you mean when you say, the soul is immortal ? " A. I mean that it can never die." (The soul that sinneth it shall die. Ezek. xviii, 4.)Page 4. "Q. Say the third commandment ? " A. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. " Q. What is commanded by the third command-ment I " A. To spend the Sunday in prayer and other re-ligious duties." Page 26. "Q. Are there any other commandments, besides the ten commandments of God? " A. There are the commandments, or precepts of the church, which are chiefly six." Page 31, 32. The first of these commandments enjoins the duty upon Romanists, of hearing Mass on Sundays." To the above we might add that the second com-mandment of the decalogue is not to be found in the Catechisms of the Papists. And also that the tenth commandment is divided into two. With the above facts before us, we see that the man of sin has thought "to change times and laws." And in addition to this, a commandment is given by the church, if possible, more fully to guard Sunday-keeping. In this latter point the Protestant churches differ but little-at the present day, from the Romish church : Sabbath-keep-ers hexing been excommunicated from these bodies, for bremeng the church covenant, by keeping the Sabbath of the Lord God, instead of keeping Sunday. We farther learn, that Romanists have a "thus saith the Pope, or the priest, or traditions," to offer, and urge in defence of their religious faith; while the child of God, in vindication of his faith in Christ. and of his hope of future bliss and glory, has a " thus saith the Lord." All scripture is given by inspira- tion of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness : that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." The Christian being thus " thoroughly furnished unto all good works," with "weapons, [not carnal] but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds," sebuld be ready always to give an an-swer to every man that asketh a reason of his hope with meekness and fear. "Let your Speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man." An Evil Remedied. WE have witnessed large assemblies at Advent meetings, where the expenses have fallen on a few individuals. A few sisters (some of them perhaps quite feeble) have had all the burden of the cooking for, and waiting upon, the many in attendance; so those in the vicinity of such meeting could not enjoy them, or be benefited by them. This evil can be remedied. Those who attend such meetings can take provisions and some bedding (if necessary) with them; they can try to wait upon themselves, and keep out of the way of those who have the care of the meeting upon them. Plain pro-visions are certainly best, and in accordance with the faith of God's remnant people. Let this plan be car-ried out, and the burden of meetings will not fall on a few, a door will not be opened for any to follow for "the loaves and fishes," and all may enjoy the meet-ing. Tent Meetings. JUDGING from what we have seen, we are satisfied that the time has fully come to move out with Tents in the different States where suitable men can be found to preach the Word, and where there are friends of the cause ready to furnish the necessary means to meet the expenses of such an enterprise. The time has come for the Lord's ministers to gird themselves anew for the work, and for the church to arise, and with their prayers, and some of their means, stay up their hands. The saddening trials which have arisen in some parts of the field, in con-sequence of false messengers, are passing away. The people have an ear to hear, and God forbid that we should hide our light under a bushel. We think there should be a Tent in Central and Western New York. There could be six or eight meetings held this season, and we should be ready for early operations next season. Those friends of the cause who would esteem it a privilege to give from $1 to $50 to purchase a Tent, and bear the expenses of Tent Meetings, will please address us immediately stating the sum they will give. Those Churches wishing Tent Meetings held in their vicinity, should send in seasonable requests.
