232 GENERAL HYGIENE. more. It is time when night comes, to halt and give the engine a rest for the 'next day's action. A dance till midnight for the store-clerk, shop-girl, school-teacher, or dressniaker is like forcing a trotter after he has barely won one heat, to secure a second. The horse gets distanced and breaks down,, simply be-cause he has been driven beyond his limit. If dancing is too expensive a sport for those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow and have no strength to spare, are not the same objections tenable in the case of the wealthy society lady who has a reti-nue of servants, does no manual labor, has no respon-sibility to vex her, and can sleep the entire day after a night of gayety? If it only required massage, baths, nicely prepared repasts, and comfortable beds to insure a complete recovery from the enervating or depressing effects of hours of waltzing, those who be-long to the Four Hundred ought to show no signs of dissipation. It does not follow, however, that be-cause of so favorable surroundings, those who lead the fashionable levees and are distinguished at every cotillon, are not affected nor their health compro-mised by excesses or irregular hours. The experience of physicians is that insomnia, neurasthenia, dys-pepsia, hypochondriasis, and nervous and organic in- firmities generally, are very common among society women. It is a statistical truth that the " rest-cure" institutions and sanitariums thrive on material fur-nished from this class. Those of le beau monde play out earlier than one would imagine; they experience a reaction in consequence of a life artificial and excit-ing in the extreme, which is highly exhausting, and must keep up on a stimulus of the will until some piece of the machinery snaps under the high ten-sion, and they don the habiliments of a chronic cripple. Those of the peerage are by no means exempt from the ills the populace suffer ; and if one sitting in the lap of luxury, on whom even summer winds do not roughly blow, hasn't a con-stitution that can brook the wear and tear of ball-room feats, what is to be said of the over-worked and under-fed, the heirs of toil, who are bound to follow the folly of their high-born sisters ? The question that concerns the mother and daughter is, Does it pay to indulge in a sport just to be in the fashion, or to drive the blues or dull care away, when nature protests against it ? That it does n't is evi-denced by the fair-sized list of ailing maidens and mothers out of sorts that are nowaday acquaint-ances of us all. Š The Sanitarian. THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ŠSome of us admire, others wonder at, the courage and placidity with which England faces a threatened invasion of cholera. This is because she is ready to encounter it, not only with intelligent sanitation well under control all over the land, but because she meets it as a unit, and not as we are still forced to do, in haphazard fashion, as the resources and the sanitary intelli-gence of a single State may decree, or as the whim of an autocratic officer may dictate. A great central Bureau of Health, in which ad-ministration, instruction, research, and record in matters concerning the public health sho-uld center, and to which in stress, local authorities could turn for help and counsel,Š a department which, repre-senting the sanitary and hygienic interest of this great nation, could make common cause with similar departments long since established in other lands against the ravages of disease,Š such a Bureau of Health is urgently needed in the United States to-day, and should soon be established. Such a bureau might well be organized in the Treasury Department, and consist primarily of an executive board of trained sanitarians under a competent head, which, in co-operation with the Marine Hospital Service, and, if desirable, with the medical services of the army and  navy, should perform all those far-reaching functions in the interest of the national health which the Fed-eral government alone could safely and effectively assume. An advisory board composed of physicians and sanitarians of experience and established repute, from different sections of the country, selected by the president and confirmed by the Senate, should be called in council by the executive force of the bureau, in deciding upon the general scope and nat-ure of the work to be done at all times, and be ready to advise and sustain them in times of special danger. No agency could so certainly avert panic and commercial disaster in the face of threatened pestilence, and none so surely stay its progress. The economic interests alone which are involved in a more wide-spread prevention of disease, and in the prolongation of the average term of life, should ef-fectively commend the establishment of such a Bu-reau of Health at the nation's capital. It is surely thus, and thus only, that this country can justify its claim to stand among the nations of the earth which are foremost in advancing the wel-fare of mankind. So, and so only, can it fulfill its mission, long since declared, to secure for its citi-zens, one and all, "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."Š The Century.
