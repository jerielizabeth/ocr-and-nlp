N. Haskell writes from Ham-burg that it was his intention to sail from Lon-don for South Africa, on the 10th inst., by the steamer " Hawarden Castle." Brother Haskell expects to remain in that country for some time. aAW-  We are called upon to publish quite a large number of names and addresses of persons desiring to obtain reading-matter for distribution. While we recognize the value of such work and feel glad to do all we can to assist it, the practice of publishing these addresses is attended in many cases with evil. Designing parties take ad- vantage of the opportunity to thrust in unwelcome and unwholesome matter. To avoid these evils we take the liberty to suggest for the consideration of our tract . society officers the following plan : Let each State de-pository become a depot for receiving all litera-ture that will be donated for such purpose ; and those who require this literature could easily ob-tain it from their State headquarters. In case any State depository becomes overstocked or runs short, the REVIEW will be glad to act as a me-dium for publishing such facts. iaEr It gives us great pleasure to have with us brother E. Caro M. D., of Napier, New Zealand, who is journeying around the world. Brother Caro has visited friends in Germany and Eng-land. He deeply mourns the untimely death of his oldest son, who, having finished a medical education in an English university, visited his brothers in Ann Arbor University last spring, was taken suddenly ill, and died. A younger son lately graduated in medical studies at Ann Arbor ; and after post-graduate study in England, will return to his native country. Dr. Caro's wife has been and is one of the staunch friends of the cause in New Zealand, and we share her joy that her husband has fully identified himself with the precious truths we hold, nr-  We are disappointed in not having re-ceived the report of the Indiana camp-meeting, which we promised last week. nr-  Years ago the reports in the Progress Department often informed us that so many had begun the observance of the Sabbath, and so many " subscribed for the REVIEW."  The latter feature has been dropped from the reports, and we do not complain about that ; but is it not as important now as itever was, and even more so, that those who come newly to the faith should be ministered to weekly by the good things of our paper? We believe it is even so. We will be glad to furnish the ministry with extra copies of the REVIEW with which to can-vass those who embrace the truth. It would be gratifying to the publishers and editors to re-ceive from every place where present truth is planted a list of new subscribers ; not solely on our own account, but because it would be for the edification of the believers. CIW'' An enthusiastic religionist, writing in the New York Observer, holds it to be the duty of the State to provide for every teacher and pupil of the public schools a copy of the Bible ! But why not go further? Why should not the State also send with the Bible a small unsectarian(?) catechism with which more fully to inculcate the teachings of the Bible ? And then, when Utah is admitted into the Union of States, she can add the " Book of Mormon " and the " Book of Doctrines and Covenants," so that the pupils shall not lack for religious instruction ! For if a State should supply to its public schools, books teaching whatever religion is believed by the majority of the citizens who have developed and built up the State, then certainly the Mor-mon Church will have a fine opportunity when this principle will be once established. The following extract fom a private let-ter from Elder A. T. Robinson, osliows that a remarkable and gratifying change of public sen-timent has taken place in regard to our work and people in South Africa : Š "Some three months ago we received a fornial peti-tion to the Seventh-day Adventists, to open a good day-school in Claremont, the rates of tuition to be such as would place it within the reach of persons of limited means, laborers, etc. We felt. this to be a providen-tial opening, so we began to look about to see if a suit-able place in which to open such a school could be found. No such place could be secured, but a nice piece of ground was offered to us for £200, which we purchased and immediately let out the contract for a building to be erected, for £210. This building, which is all in one room, 24ft. x 48ft. inside, is completed and furnished, and we opened the new school, July 4, with an attend-ance -of thirty-seven pupils, which has since been in-creased to nearly fifty. This school is in charge of Mrs. J. C. Rogers, and bids fair to be a grand success. Cer-tainly it is a new departure in the educationalline among our people, the school being called for by those not of our faith, and only one family of our own people's children in attendance. Quite a number of the parents were in to the opening exercises, and expressed much pleasure with the arrangements of the school." EN ROUTE TO MASHONALAND. FURTHER news has just been received from the company en route for Mashonaland. Bulawayo, the capital of Matabeleland was reached July 5. Here the governor of the new province, Dr. Jamieson, was visited, and from him encourage-ment was received of a liberal donation of land for mission purposes. It was hoped that one tract could be secured near Bulawayo and another north of Fort Salisbury. But negotiations re- garding this were still pending at the time brother E. J. Harvey wrote us. Brother Harvey says : "Thus far we have not been molested in the least by lions, tigers, nor snakes. We dwell safely." We shall be glad to give further notice of the progress of our work in Central Africa, as we re-ceive news from time to time F. M. WILCOX. DEATH OF ELDER A. E. FLOWERS. WITH deepest sorrow we announce the death of brother A. E. Flowers, who left us last Feb-ruary to labor in the Island of Trinidad. He fell a victim to that dread scourge of the tropics of the western hemisphere, yellow fever, after an illness of but five days. His death occurred OD Sunday, June 29. Up to the Sabbath, it was supposed he was doing well, and his recovery was anticipated ; then came a change which was suc-ceeded by the sad event. Brother Flowers was 'a man beloved by all who knew him. His earnest and kind spirit, directed by the grace of his Master, made him a dear friend and a valuable laborer. His many friends in Missouri and elsewhere will deeply feel his loss. But upon his stricken wife the blow comes with dreadful force. Sister Flowers will return to this country. May the God of all grace and comfort minister to broken hearts, and heal the wound his own cause has received. Brother Grant, his companion in labor, was first attacked by the disease, but happily recov- ered. G. C. T. CHANGES IN THE FACULTIES. QUITE a number of changes will take place in the persomel of our school faculties the coming year. Among other changes of professors, we note the following : G. W. Caviness, of South Lancaster, becomes president of Battle Creek College ; J. H. Haughey, of Battle Creek, be-comes principal of Smith Lancaster Academy ; Elder E. J. Hibbard, of Pennsylvania, is ex-pected to conduct the Biblical department of Battle Creek College ; and Fred Allison Howe, of Faribault, Minn., will have charge of the En-glish department. F. M. Howe, of Battle Creek, becomes president of Healdsburg College, W. C. Grainger having resigned, to enter for a time the ministerial field. Elder E. E. Andros, of Cali-fornia, takes the Biblical department of that school, which has been so well conducted by Elder R. S. Owen, who now re-enters the ministerial work. In Union College, the department of Natural Sciences will be filled by M. E. Cady, of Battle Creek ; and the vacancy in the German department, caused by H. F. Schuberth going to the Danish school, will be filled by Carl Moench, from this Office. C. B. Hughes, of Walla Walla, will have charge of the school soon to be opened in Texas. Other changes have doubt-less been made of which we have not learned. There is a feeling of good courage prevailing in connection with all these institutions, notwith-standing the pressure of hard times that prevails in so many parts of this country. G. C. T.
