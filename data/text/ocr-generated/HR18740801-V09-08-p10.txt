If he were to -say, " There is nothing serious the matter with you ; you have only to keep in bed and feed on ,slops, and you will be well in a week," that 'doctor would be discharged, and one sent for who would " understand the case and give -something to cure it." The mental effect of the visits of a cheery doctor is of great help to patients who are not especially ill, and his ,services in this respect are worth all they cost. We think that those papers which under the head of a " Hygienic Department " publish all sorts of remedies and recipes, do more harm than good. Hygiene has very little to do with dosing. We may here perhaps properly answer -questions which have been proposed probably a hundred times in one form or another, that is, if in our denunciation of all secret remedies, patent or proprietary medicines, we would not exempt this or that particular one which the writ-er has tried and found useful. No ; we do not 'except one. A large portion of these are frauds, being mere stimulants of the cheapest sort. 'Others are medicinal, but there is not one of them from beginning to end that is composed of any -other than well-known drugs. No ; we object to all these things put up in bottles and labeled, for the reasons that you do not know what you are taking, and that you are paying an enormous price for some cheap drug≈†fifty cents or a dol-lar for what could be bought for five or ten -cents, simply because it is put up in a bottle with a showy label, and called somebody's " balsam," " panacea," or what not. The hun--dreds of babies that have come to their untimely -death from theorise of " soothing sirups," which the mothers did not know contained deadly -quantities of morphine, should be a sufficient -warning against secret compounds. Our friends who have sent us recipes for what they consider the best thing in the world " for this or that -disease, must excuse us if we do not pub-lish them. It is a little curious that most persons recommend any remedy as " the best thing in the world," while their knowledge of :the world is exceedingly limited. Free Drinking Fountains. BY RALPH E. HOYT. ONE of the most patent causes of whisky-,drinking and beer-guzzling in many of our large cities is the scarcity of good water in public places. In Chicago, for example, there rare scarcely half a dozen public fountains, or hydrants, where the thirsty can at all times help themselves to a drink of pure cold water, free of cost, and without intruding upon the rights or privileges of others. But there is a saloon in every business block, while many  blocks contain a dozen or more. Men whose dietetic habits are bad (as most men's are) be-come thirsty very many times during a hot day, and rush into *loons to procure ale, beer, or something stronger, when, if pure cold water were at hand, they would be satisfied with " the beverage prepared by God himself to refresh and invigorate his creatures and beautify his footstool." But it is not to be had, at least not conveniently, and so they resort to the saloons. If the time and money expended in the re-cent " temperance crusade " had been used in the erection of a free drinking fountain in front of every saloon, the cause of total abstinence would have been helped forward far more than by the impractical measures which were gener-ally resorted to. Chicago, July, 1874. Smell. THE seat of the sense of smell, says M. Papillon, in the Moniteur S'cientlfigue, is, as we know, in the lining membrane of the nos-trils. This membrane has a mucous and irreg-ular surface, over which spread a number of nerves, with delicate terminations. It secretes a lubricating liquid. By means of muscles, the apparatus of smell is dilated or contracted, like that of sight. The mechanics of smell are, simply, the con-tact of odorous particles and the olfactory nerve. These particles are carried by the air into the nostrils. If, on the one hand the nerve is in-jured, or even compressed ; if, on the other, the air is prevented from passing into the the nos-trils, there is an absence of smell. The upper part of the nostrils is the most sensitive as re-gards odor. The sense of smell varies much in different people. Some are entirely without it. Others are quite insensible to certain odors ; a case similar to that of Daltonism, in which some eyes fail to perceive certain colors. It is recorded of a certain priest that he per-ceived no odors but those of smoke and decayed cabbage, and to another person vanilla seemed quite inodorous. Blumenbach speaks of an Englishman who could not perceive the frag-rance of mignonette. Smell is sometimes voluntary, sometimes in-voluntary. In the former case, to obtain a lively sensation, we close the mouth and make a long inspiration, or a series of short and jerk-ing ones. The muscles contract the orifice of the nostrils, and thus increase the intensity of the current of air. On the other hand, when we wish not to smell, we expire through the nose so as to drive away the odorous air, and inspire by the opened mouth. Smell and odors are closely connected with the phenomena of taste or gustation. Most savors perceived by us arise from a combination
