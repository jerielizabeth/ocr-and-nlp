A DOCTOR'S CHATS. 251 roomy one, was situated upon a hill in a very sightly place, but unfortunately within forty rods of a mill pond, the water of which at certain seasons of the year became low and stagnant, exposing many acres of slime-covered soil, a most effective breeding place for malaria. Under ordinary circumstances even this unfortunate condition gave rise to no inconven-ience, as the pond was situated southeast of the house, while the prevailing wind was from the south-west. At the time when the fatal illness occurred, the southeast wind had been blowing steadily for two or three weeks, the water in the pond being at the time very low. This was unquestionably the cause of the gentleman's illness and death. The germs of typhoid aver apt infrequently cling to a residence for many years, so that deaths occur in one family after another which successively occupy the house, each succeeding diseased family being often in ignorance of the previous fatalities. When a well once be-comes infected with typhoid fever germs through the seepage from an adjacent privy vault, cleaning out the well amounts to nothing, as it would generally be necessary to clean out a space bounded at the surface by a circle with a diameter three times the depth of a well extending down into the earth to the bottom of the well, or at least below the water level. Such a mode of cleaning a well is of course imprac-ticable. The only thing to be done with a well  which has become infected with typhoid fever germs is to close it up. It is impossible to have a well upon such premises, or near by even, which will not be in danger of similar infection. A very forcible illustration of the necessity of in-quiring into the previous history of a house before taking possession of it was recently furnished by a Philadelphia physician : in making a careful study of the causes of death in the older and principal wards of the city he found that the deaths from con-sumption were largely confined to a certain number of houses. These houses were for the most part arranged in groups, showing that the disease had extended from one house to adjacent houses. Apropos of this subject, the writer many years ago suggested that the health officer of every town should keep a register in which should be represented every house in the town or city, in connection with which there should be kept a complete sanitary history of the building, which should show every case of sick-ness from whatever cause, whether chronic or acute, and all cases of death, with the causes of death. A person desirous of purchasing or renting a dwelling, could, by consulting this register, learn the exact history of any house which might be under consider-ation, and might obtain information, the value of which, in the saving of sickness and life, could scarcely be estimated. 4 Ł SELP-EXAMINATION FOR CATARACT.- A writer in Knowlea'ge, of London, describes a method by which one may examine his own eyes with reference to the existence of 'cataract. The only instrument neces-sary is a piece of smooth cardboard in which a small hole has been pierced with a pin. Turning the eye toward the clear sky, cover it with the card in such a manner as to bring the pin hole close to the eye and opposite the pupil. When the card is in proper position, a wide, faintly illuminated field appears, on which the cataract will be projected, if present. This phenomenon is due to the fact that a shadow is produced by the small penciled light through the pin hole. ANTISEPTIC GUM .ŠA German has at last found a real utility for gum. Modern researches have shown that the germs of consumption, diphtheria, pneu-monia, and other maladies are almost constantly present in the mouths of fully half of all persons living in civilized communities. This fact empha- sises the importance of mouth cleanliness. Cleans-ing the mouth very thoroughly several times daily with a brush and water to which some mild antiseptic has been added, such as essence of cinnamon, men-thol, or thymol, is an excellent precaution against these contagious maladies. Nevertheless, the in- frequency of the application must greatly lessen its efficiency to secure constant asepsis of the mouth. A German professor has proposed the use of gum containing a mild antiseptic. It is not, of course, to be supposed that the amount of any germicide which can be used in this way will be sufficient to actually destroy the dangerous microbes which may be found present in the mouth, but it has long been known that the presence of a certain amount of such anti-septics as cinnamon, and most other essential oils, but particularly cinnamon, is sufficient to prevent the growth and development of nearly all dangerous germs,Š to paralyze the microbe. Thus, even al-though the microbes are not actually destroyed, their pernicious activity is controlled and their develop-ment prevented.
