O 542 ADVENT REVIEW AHD SABBATH HERALD. "[VoL. 71, No. 34. IP\  16. What to him who loses his life? 17. How closely will the division be made? 1,8. What did Jesus reply in answer to the question where these judgments should occur? NOTE. "The kingdom of God is within you." This may be rendered " among you." But the idea which the Saviour seeks to impress on our minds is the fact of the gra.dual development of the kingdom. Those who are waiting for it to burst upon them suddenly will see it too late. The kingdom'Of God is a condition, as well as a place. Only those in whom the principles of the kingdom are developed can have any part in it when it ,is revealed. God bestows upon us his glory in this present time. (See John 17:22; 1 Peter 5:1.) This glory is in the form' of, his grace. Christ's glory when on this earth was the glory of the only-begotten Son of God, but it was manifested in his fullness of grace and truth. John 1:14. The effect of the glory in this present time is to transform the characters of those Łwho believe. (See 2 Cor. 3:18; 4:4-6.) Thus they become fitted to dwell in the kingdom where the glory of God shines without being vailed. Then when at last the glory is revealed, it will not be so unnatural and for-eign a thing as to blind them, and cause their death, but will simply add the finishing touch in the transforma-tion; namely, to change their bodies so that they will also shine as the sun.
