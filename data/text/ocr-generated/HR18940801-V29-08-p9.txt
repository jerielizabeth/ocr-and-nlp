GENERAL HYGIENE. "Es mass der Held, mach altenz Branch, Der thierisch rahen Machten unterliegen,"Š" Heroes, according to established custom, Have to succumb to beasts and brutal force,"Š unless, perhaps, their heroism, like that of the great Frederic, should happen to be alloyed with an intense (To be continued.) NURSING IN HOMES, PRIVATE HOSPITALS, AND SANITARIUMS. BY MRS. S. M. BAKER, Medical Matron of the Surgical Department of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. (Continued.) 229 distrust of mankind, or with the still rarer gist of that thick-skinned stoicism that enabled Marcus Aurelius to " love justice and truth, yet live without anger in the midst of lying and unjust men." How few, outside of the trained specialists, un-derstand that of the different forms of hydropathic treatment, one will produce a tonic effect, another a sedative, another a moderate eliminative, another a full eliminative, effect ; that one will diminish pelvic congestion, another will reduce cerebral congestion, and so on through the list of ailments and remedial measures. The relief from pain which a hot sitz bath will give, the invigorating effect of a cool shallow bath, the soothing influence of the hot spray, or alternate hot and cold sponging of the spine, the comfort of a blanket pack or home-ar-ranged Turkish bath in conditions requiring their use, or of a cool wet-sheet pack in fevers, the in-describable exhilaration of a salt glow, is something known only to those who have witnessed their magic working. In the struggle with the disease which the nurse has aided the physician in combating by means of some one or two of these lines of treatment, the value of which the intelligent physician is coming more and more to appreciate, she has instilled the idea of the rational use of dietetics and of that simple though wonderful and universal remedy, water, into the minds of the family ; and now that the crisis is past, she has come to the waiting time, often the weary waiting, for the return of strength. Can the nurse do more than to see that the diet, treatment, fresh air, and sunshine are made to do their part in bringing the longed-for strength ? The long-unused muscles of the patient are weak and almost useless, and she must find her strength in the use of them. She must have exercise to quicken the sluggish circulation, to stimulate the nutrition and carry off the waste. Even while still in bed, she can be led through a gradually increasing scale of exercises. Beginning with hand and arm flexing, and foot and leg flexing, after a few days she can attempt head rotating or arm raising. Perhaps she is too feeble to raise the arm more than a little or a few times the first day. the ne)tt a little higher,  till the arms can be extended directly upward ; then turning from side to side, or other exercise as she can bear, being careful always not to overdo. As she is able to sit up in a chair, trunk bending, twisting, or rotating may be added to the other movements ; then the breathing exercises after meals ; the quick and the slow and deep inhala-tions and exhalations, broadening the chest, de-veloping the lungs, purifying and enriching the blood, and sending the glow of returning health to the cheek. These movements are all supplementary to the massage, and manual Swedish movements, with active and passive movements ; and the pa-tient is on her feet in much quicker time and with more strength than if the important matter of ex-ercise had been neglected. The criticism has sometimes been made that hos-pital training schools for nurses do not accomplish all that is desirable in the preparation of nurses for work in caring for the sick in private homes. Hos-pital work is somewhat routine in character, and necessarily runs in more or less definitely fixed grooves which are determined by the general class of work to which a hospital is devoted, or by the predilections of superintendents or of the house or consulting physicians. In hospital work, also, everything is done under the eye, and to a very large degree under the immediate direction, of the physician. The work in a public hospital is nec-essarily simplified as far as possible, in consequence of the large number of cases which must be cared for by each individual nurse; and the facilities of public hospitals do not always afford so great a variety of remedial agencies, especially those of a hygienic or non-medical character, as might be provided if the business managers were at liberty to draw upon an unlimited fund for the support of their work. The facilities of dietetic, electro-thera-peutic, hydropathic, kinesipathic, and other hy-gienic measures of treatment furnished by ordinary public hospitals are, to say the least, very meager;
