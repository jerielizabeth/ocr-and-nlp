LEAVING Christiania July 5, we reached Gry-thyttehed, the place of the Swedish Conference, on the afternoon of the 6th. As this trip took us into the heart of Sweden, where English-speaking people arc not found as they are in the coast cities and on the main lines of travel, brother John Lorntz kindly accompanied us, his help being quite essential in the various changes of route required to reach the place. A marked change in the face of the country is apparent in passing from Norway to Sweden. The mountains disappear, and tillable land is more abundant ; but the marks of thrift and enterprise are less numerous. Sweden is so noted for its production of iron ore that the term " Swedish iron " has become a synonym for that which stands first in quality. In riding through the country we passed several iron mines of ex-tensive proportions, in some of which the purity of the ore is said to run as high as ninety-seven per cent. Grythyttehed is a pleasant little village in the interior of the country, where the truth has been thoroughly preached, and a flourishing church has been raised up. They have erected a small but neat and convenient chapel in which most of the meetings were held, though a tent was pitched by the side of the building, and a nice white birch grove on the side of the hill furnished a still more inviting place for the gatherings of the people when the weather was propitious. The business meetings of the Conference were past when we arrived, but the meetings for Bible study, for the benefit of the workers, were in progress, and during the last three days we had the privilege of speaking to the people five times. The themes treated upon by the various speakers were such as pertain to the interests of the church at the present time,Šthe dangers and duties of the hour ; the crisis that is coming upon the people of God in the last conflict with the powers of darkness ; the impending judg-ment ; and the preparation we must make in our own hearts and lives to be ready for the ex-periences we are soon to meet. The Lord has graciously given instruction to his people in re-gard to the external difficulties they are to en-counter, the testimony we are to bear to the world, and the internal work of grace necessary to our own spiritual condition, to be ready to meet the Lord in peace. The truth produces the same effect upon the hearts of men everywhere, and the interests, hopes, and determinations of the people of God are one in all lands. The brethren here, as elsewhere, seemed desir-ous of entering more fully into the spirit of the work. The unity of feeling which characterized the business proceedings of the Conference, was especially noticeable, and was a source of great encouragement to the brethren. One of the prominent workers of the Conference remarked that he had never seen such unanimity of senti- ment prevailing in any meeting before. Ł The work in Sweden is going forward pros-perously. It has had unusual obstacles to meet. Some of Satan's worst agents have been on the field to war against it, but it has gone steadily forward notwithstanding. The way is opening remarkably for the spread of the truth in Fin-land. Publications in that language are already in circulation there, and believers are rallying to the standard of the truth. Through the influ-ence of some Finns residing in St. Petersburg, the prospect is now that an opening is ready for the entrance of the light into the very city of the czar. A Finnish brother was present at the Conference, and in one of the social meetings bore a ringing testimony, showing a deep Chris-tian experience and a fervent love for the truth. It was translated into Swedish for the benefit of the congregation, and from the Swedish into English for the benefit of the English brethren present. It was an interesting occasion. This meeting came at the regular time of the quarterly meetings, and the ordinances were ac-cordingly celebrated. Never have we seen a peo-ple enter more cordially into the exercises of such an occasion ; and the blessing of the Lord seemed to be correspondingly present. It was a good meeting, reminding one of the words of the apos-tle, " There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling." Eph. 4 : 4. Five were baptized. Not much opportunity was given to make the acquaintance of the brethren in Sweden, the time of our stay being so short ; but brief as it was, the visit was one to be greatly prized. Indeed it has been a great privilege to meet with the brethren, and visit the different countries, in all these Scandinavian fields. We found a class of believers surpassing in all respects our expecta-tions,Š a class prepared intelligently to represent the truth and bring it commendably to the atten-tion of the people. It is a matter for congratu-lation that the message is finding in these fields such a class of supporters ; for with the blessing of God, the stability and permanence of the work are thus more clearly assured. Millions of souls people these lands, but the Spirit of the Lord can in a brief time search out all the hon-est in heart, such as shall be saved in his king-dom. And that these are many of these there can be no doubt. The Lord raise up laborers to go forth, and from the highways and hedges gather together the guests for the marriage sup-per of the Lamb. Before leaving Sweden we had the privilege of visiting for one day the city of Stockholm. Even so brief a stay well repaid the visit to that historic and pleasant city. But one object of interest can be particularly noticed here ; namely, the king's library, a large building in which are gathered every variety of literary treasure. Here are specimens of the hand-made books of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The uniformity of the lettering, all done with a pen, the fine work in the vignettes and illustrations, are really marvelous pieces of work. The gold-leaf is as bright, and the coloring on the plates as brilliant, apparently, as the day when they were put on, four or five hundred years ago. Here are books with marginal notes written by Martin Luther. Here are manuscripts from his pen and from long before his time, even from Huss and Wycliffe. Here are documents from the contemporaries of Luther,Š Melanchthon, Zwingle, Jienry VIII., etc. But there is one book which is considered of especial interest. It is called " The Devil's  Bible," and is said to be the largest book in the world. Its dimensions, as nearly as could well be determined through the glass case in which it is enshrined, are about three feet in perpendicu-lar hight, opening to some four feet and a half, and being when closed about a foot and a half in thickness. It is a Latin Bible, written on parchment made from asses' skins, and it took three hundred such skins to furnish the material. It is called the Devil's Bible from the full-page portraiture which it contains, of what was sup-posed to be his infernal deformity, devised with all the grotesque, ridiculous, and horrible feat-ures which the unbalanced brain of a supersti-tious monk in the gloomiest cloister of the Dark Ages, could invent. The date of the book we were unable to ascertain. It came into posses-sion of the Swedes as a trophy captured from the Germans in some of the past wars between these nations. From Stockholm we returned to Hamburg by way of Fredrikshavn. Reaching Gothenburg, Tuesday, July 10, a calm passage of five hours across the Cattegat brought us to the quaint and quiet town of Fredrikshavn in northern Denmark, the location of our Scandinavian school. It was a matter of interest to look over the grounds and buildings now to be devoted to the important work of preparing laborers to carry forward the closing message in these countries. The build-ing is a large, imposing structure, three stories above the basement, and capable of accommo-dating some sixty or more students. It is de-signed to add to it when the attendance shall demand, and to provide a sanitarium on adjoin-ing grounds in the near future. The sea is here sheltered from severe storms by outlying islands, which act as a breakwater, and its waves roll up on the beach a few rods from the door. The situation is a pleasant one, and ample grounds which can be devoted to gardening purposes will furnish a good field for manual labor. The building is well-nigh completed, and will be ready for occupancy by the first of September. The Lord has blessed this enterprise from the beginning, both in suitable labor and necessary means, and in the earnestness and enthusiasm with which the work has been taken hold of and carried forward by those who are especially interested therein. The question now is how to secure the attendance of all those who should have the benefits of a training at this institution. The enterprise is well regarded in the community, and doubtless considerable patronage will be secured from those without. The prospect be-fore the work here is very encouraging. We reached Hamburg, July 11, and after a pause of a few hours, proceeded on our way to the camp-meeting in Switzerland. INCREASING LIGHT. "THE path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day." Such is the declaration of the Scriptures, and such is the universal law of life and devel-opment. Whether considered in its application to individual experience, or to the history of the cause of truth, it is of equal force. Moral char-acter and spiritual experience feed upon revealed truth and heavenly light. As the power of as-similation increases, so will the supply of life-giving grace increase. God gives to each of his children all the light and truth he can appropriate. But he has no desire to waste upon inactive or unappreciative  740 7.11t
