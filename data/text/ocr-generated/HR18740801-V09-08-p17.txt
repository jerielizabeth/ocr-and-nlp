How to Cleanse Artificial Dentures. BY DR. D. C. HAWRHURST. I HAVE told you in the preceding number of this journal that you cannot judge of the purity of your own breath. Your senses can-not tell you whether the dental plate which you are wearing has been thoroughly cleansed or not. Having pointed out a certain way of ascertaining this, it now remains for me to de-scribe such methods of purification and disin-fection as are adapted to artificial dentures. Among cleansing agents, the most important are water and a good brush. To these should be added that searching friction which can only be secured in its perfection by the use of a good powder. Without powder the brush will slip along over all but the crudest impurities, and will not cleanse with any satisfactory degree of thoroughness. There is often a little mucus and the pulpy remains of food, combined with freshly deposited calcareous matter, spread over certain parts of the plate, which the brush will not readily take hold of when used with water alone. By using a powder, the bristles may be made to cut their way through this slippery deposit, and render the plate comparatively free from any odor-producing substance. I dare not undertake to say how frequently I have examined plates that had just been " thoroughly brushed," and how I have found their surfaces covered with a thin film of or-ganic matter, which the use of a small amount of powder would have removed. A lens of moderate magnifying power will render this more apparent to the eye, and may frequently reveal something frightful to a person of re-fined taste. In a few cases, the means just described may be made to cleanse your plate thoroughly, es-pecially if you have taken great pains to carry your brush vigorously through all the fissures and interstices of the plate. But it will often happen that when you have done this, a subtle and invisible fetor still remains, which neither your brush can remove, nor your friends en-dure. If this be the case, you must find it out. It is a matter of too much importance to be neg-lected. And I must again remind you that your friends are your only resource for an ex-amination. Your own senses are worthless to  detect that which they have been long accus-tomed to. If you discover that there are un-pleasant emanations still lingering about your plate, you will know that your task is now one of chemistry rather than mechanical cleansing. How to perform this, we will briefly consider. Exactly what to do to render such a plate odorless, will depend in a great measure upon the character of the fetor, and especially upon its causes. The latter vary so greatly in differ-ent cases that no one method will cleanse ev-ery plate. After thorough brushing with pow-der has removed all but the odor, I have known a plate to be rendered sweet by the use of sim-ple lime-water, applied Ł with a brush. It is often well to let a plate soak during several minutes in lime-water. Should this not prove. effectual, a weak solu-tion of permanganate of potash will often ac-complish all that can be desired. A half ounce may be bought in the form of crystals. You will drop a half dozen crystals into a quarter of a glass of water, or more in proportion. In-to this, put the plate which you would purify. It may remain from one to twenty minutes, ac-cording to the degree of obstinacy with which it holds its odor. If the rich wine color of the solution is weakened while the plate remains in it, or turns brown, an additional number of the crystals should be thrown in. It must be a very obstinate and unregenerate plate that can resist such treatment. I have seen a great many plates that were quite unbearable, and that had stoutly resisted other processes of cleansing, come out quite sweet after soaking ten minutes in this solution of permanganate of potash. After this treatment, you will rinse with pure water, brush with soap and water, rendered fragrant with orange and cinnamon waters, or fit it for the mouth in any way that fancy shall dictate or taste find agreeable. I must not forget to mention a very excellent process of cleansing dental plates by means of soap and powder. This method involves the vigorous use of a brush along with an abund-ance of soft water. The powder best adapted for this purpose is pulverized pumice-stone, to be bought at the druggists. The objection to ordinary tooth powder is that it immediately renders the water hard. These materials are usually at hand, or easily obtainable, and will often prove efficient. And yet, I am bound to say that many a plate will go through the sever-est ordeal that can be put upon it with brush, soap, and powder, without yielding that last vestige of odor which shall betray its presence in the mouth. In this case, you must fly to permanganate of potash or hypochlorite of lime for relief. If you cannot get these agents, fasten your plate in a stream of running water, or bury it in black muck over night, or pack it in pulverized charcoal, or soak it in alcohol for
