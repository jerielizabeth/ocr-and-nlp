On such an excursion in the summer of 183Š, I entered 4&e vine-hung cabin in the environs of In its low, wide kitchen, I saw a middle aged woman, busily ironing, a boy yet too young for labor, and a girl of some seventeen or eigliteen.  years, of a sweet serious aspect, platting straw. She did not raise her eyes as I entered, and,a  a nearer approach, I perceived that she 17as blind.

They listened attentively, and tears rolled slow-ly from the sightless eyes of the young girl. It was indeed tidings, new and wonderful, unto them, for like others of the simple peasantry of France, they were accustomed to sing sweet hymns a4 murmur devout orisons to "blessed Mary, moTher mild," while Christ and his salva-tion were hidden from their hearts.

No, not these; but she longed to read the blessed words of Jesus, how he said, " Come unto me, and I will give you rest." requires a delicate touch to distinguish raised surface and nice outline of Ł d her fingers were hard and cal- lous wi e constant platting of straw.

Could not she cut away the thick; hard skin from her fingers, and then it would grow anew, smooth and soft, like the rosy fingers of a child? And so she whittled the skin from the poor fingers, heeding not the pain ; was it not that she might read the word of God?
