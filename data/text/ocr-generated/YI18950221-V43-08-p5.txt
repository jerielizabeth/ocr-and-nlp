FEBRUARY 21, 1895, THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 61 LESSON 10.-THE TIME OF THE JUDGMENT (CONTINUED). (March 9, 1895.) MEMORY VERSES.- Dan. 9 : 25-27. REVIEW QUESTIONS.- It would be well to go over the last lesson carefully before taking up the lesson for this week, and be sure to fix in mind the great prin-ciples suggested by the following review questions :- I. What great prophetic period was introduced in our last lesson ? 2. What is to take place at the end of that time ? 3. Of what great and solemn event does the cleans-ing of the sanctuary form a part ? 4. How much of the twenty-three hundred days was cut off upon the Jewish people ? SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.- I. The texts of Script-ure used in this lesson are not so numerous as they have been in other lessons. Dan. 9: 24-27 contains the prophecy of the seventy weeks. Ezra 6 : 14 and 7 : 11-26 show when the commandment went forth to restore and build Jerusalem. Mark I : 14, margin, shows the date when Christ was anointed as the Mes-siah by the Holy Ghost. 2. Read these texts carefully, and see what you find in them without help from man. It is your privilege to pray to God for yourself, and to receive divine enlightenment. Answer the following questions after a careful study of Dan. 9 : 24-27 : Into how many parts are the seventy weeks divided ? How many weeks in each part ? How many days in each part? How many years would these days represent? Have you learned when the seventy weeks begin ? Ezra 6 : 14 and 7: 11-26 with marginal date will tell you. Reckoning from this date, when would the first part or period of the seventy weeks end ? the second ? the third ? When would the " midst " of the last, or seventieth, come ? What would be done at the end of the first period ? Dan. 9 : 25. At the end of the sec-ond ? At the end of the third ? In the midst of the seventieth week ? Do you know where the twenty-three hundred years begin ? Do they begin at the same time as the seventy weeks ? Then when would they end ? What.does Dan. 8 : 54 say would take place at the end of the twenty-three hundred days ? What is the cleansing of the sanctuary ? All these questions are answered in the notes, but please study out answers for yourselves before looking at the notes. The notes are to help you, not to carry you. You may have to look to the notes for historical evidences, especially if you do not haVe access to books of reference. I. WHAT event marked the commencement of the seventy weeks ? Dan. 9 : 25. 2. What decrees formed the commandment mentioned in the prophecy ? Ezra 6 : 14. 3. Where is the last installment of the com-mandment recorded ? Ezra 7 : 22-26. 4. What is its date? (See margin of Ezra 7, and note 1.) 5. Into how many and what parts were the seventy weeks divided ? Dan. 9 : 25-27. 6. What was to be done during the first seven weeks ? (See note 2.) 7.

What was Christ to do in the midst of the week ? io. How was this accomplished ? (See note 3.) 22. Beginning with B. c. 457, when would each of these divisions of the seventy weeks end ? (See note 4.) 12. How do these dates harmonize with the records of history ? (See note 5.) 13. What was the date of Christ's manifes-tation as the .Messiah? Mark I : 24, 15 (mar-gin). (See note 6.) 14. When was he crucified ? - In the spring of A. D. 31. 25. Then when would the seventy weeks terminate ? - A. D. 34. 26. What took place at that time? (See note 7.) 27. After cutting off seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety days, from the twenty-three hundred days, how much would remain? - Eighteen hundred and ten. 28. Beginning with A. D. 34, to what date would eighteen hundred and ten more years bring us ? - 2844. 29. What solemn work began, then, in 1844 ? 20. At what time in the year did the twenty-three hundred days terminate ? (See note 8.) 21. How long, then, has the judgment been in session ? 22. How long was the service in the first apartment of the earthly sanctuary continued without change ? 23. In point of time, how did the service in the most holy place compare with that in the holy place ? - It was very brief. 24. What must we conclude, then, with re-gard to the service in the heavenly sanctuary ? (See note 9.) 25. What solemn announcement will soon be made? Rev. 22 : II, 12. NOTES. T. The date of the decree recorded in Ezra 7 is one of the best-established dates in the Scriptures. It has been proved correct by the concurrent agreement of more than twenty eclipses. (See " Sanctuary and Its Cleans-ing," chapter seven.) 2. The building of the wall in troublous times refers, evidently, to the carrying out of the commandment to restore and build Jerusa-lem after the decree of, Artaxerxes in B. c. 457. The seven weeks, or forty-nine years, would, therefore, end in 408 B. C. Houbigant's trans-lation of verse 25, as quoted by Dr. Adam Clarke, is quite clear on this point. It reads as follows≈Å: " Know, therefore, and under-stand : From the edict which shall be promul-gated, to return and rebuild Jerusalem, there shall be seven weeks. Then it shall be fully rebuilt, with anxiety in difficult times. Thence to the Prince Messiah there shall be sixty-two weeks." 3. The sacrifice and oblation, so far as acceptable service in the temple was concerned, were caused to cease by Christ's sacrifice on Calvary, because they all met their fulfilment in the death of the Lamb of God. 4. The seven weeks would end in B. c. 408 ; the sixty-two weeks would end in A. D. 27 ; the middle of the seventieth week, in A. D. 31 ; and the end of the seventy weeks, in A. D. 34. 5. The dates harmonize exactly with the records of history, and thus the seventy weeks, with its various divisions, seal up or make sure the vision and the prophecy, by showing the correctness of a right interpretation and appli-cation of the time, and by detecting and exposing all false interpretations and applica-tions. This will be readily seen if we begin our reckoning at any other date than B. c. 45 7- 6. " Messiah " means " anointed One." Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit at his baptism. Matt. 3 : 16 ; Acts 10 : 38. Hence the sixty-two weeks reached to A. D. 27. 7. The special work for the Jewish people, the confirming of the covenant with many for one week (the last week of the seventy), closed in A. D. 34. This date is marked by a general rejection of the gospel by that people, the martyrdom of Stephen, and a great persecu-tion of the church by the Jews. As a result the believers were scattered abroad, and went everywhere preaching the gospel. Acts 7, 8. The next year, A. D. 35, Saul was converted, and soon began his work as the apostle to the Gentiles. 8. Although the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem was issued in the spring of B. c. 45 7, the work of building the wall, to which the seventy weeks were allotted, did not begin till the fall of that year. This will ap-pear when we remember that it took several months for the people to get ready for and make such a journey, and then prepare for the great work to be done. The record states that they did not reach Jerusalem till the fifth month. Ezra 7 : 8, 9. From the fact that seven weeks of the seventy were allotted to the building of the wall, and that work did not be-gin till the autumn of B. c. 457, we conclude that the time to begin to reckon the seventy weeks must be in the autumn, or when the commandment was carried into effect, and not the date of the issue. In other words, the ex-pression, " From the going forth of the com-mandment to restore and to build Jerusalem," is to be understood in harmony with the facts to which we have already alluded. Hence the twenty-three hundred days, and all the divis-ions of it that contained full years, would ter-minate in the fall of the year. The baptism of Jesus would occur in the autumn of A. D. 27, his crucifixion in the spring of A. D. 31, and the twenty-three hun-dred days would end in the autumn of 1844. This would be according to the type, also, as the great day of atonement, the cleansing of the sanctuary, took place in the fall, on the tenth day of the seventh month. This makes complete harmony in the chronology of the twenty-three hundred days in all its divisions, and also in its commencement and termina-tion. 9. The study of the type would lead us to conclude that the time occupied in the cleans-ing of the heavenly sanctuary nauqt also. be  brief, and, therefore, must soon be finishect. It is clearly evident from the Scriptures that the Lord never designed to reveal the exact time when Christ's mediation for sinners will cease, and probation will close. (See Matt. 24 :  42-44; Mark 23 : 32-37.) Hence no one should infer that the time occupied in the most holy place of the heavenly temple bears the same exact ratio to the time spent in the holy place as it did in the earthly sanctuary. In the typical law and service. we do not have an exact representation of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary. Heb. 10 : I. GOD IS NEAR. A CITY missionary was in the habit of visit-ing every now and then a poor old widow who dwelled alone in a dreary old attic, and was hardly able to sustain life by the little she could earn. In the little window of her lowly chamber stood a broken tea-pot, in which she reared a strawberry plant. He noticed from time to time how the plant was growing thrift-ily, and how carefully and constantly it was looked after. One day he said to her : " Your plant is doing nicely ; it can't be long before you will have some strawberries." The aged widow replied : " I do not take such care of it for the sake of the fruit it may bear, exactly ; but I am too poor to support any human being or a living creature of any kind, for that mat-ter ; and so it is a great consolation to me to have at least a live plant ; for I know it can thrive only through the power of God, and when I see it grow so nicely from day to day, it is a constant reminder to me that God is near." THERE are too many people who tiever think it worth while to be religious with their money.
