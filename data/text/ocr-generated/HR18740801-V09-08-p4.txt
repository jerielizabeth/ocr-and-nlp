228 THE HEALTH REFORMER. decently clean. But during the hot weeks of summer, a daily bath is indispensable. Two or three times a week plenty of soap and water should be employed. On other days a light sponge or towel bath will answer. A large quantity of water is not always absolutely necessary. A person can take a very refresh-ing and useful bath with a soft sponge and a pint of water. Such a bath can be taken any-where without the slightest danger of soiling even the finest carpet. The hair and feet are some times especially offensive. The hair needs cleansing several times a week in hot weather. Pure, soft water of lukewarm temperature is the best cleansing agent. No soap should ever touch the hair. Sometimes the white of an egg applied before washing will assist in removing accumulations of dandruff, and other impurities. Those por-tions of the person especially prone to generate offensive odors may often be rendered health-ful by an acid wash made by adding a little vinegar to soft water. Hygienists complain dreadfully of the awful stench of tobacco and rum. Let some of them take care that they do not become successful rivals of those disgusting articles in the matter of smell. Health reformers ought to be the cleanest, sweetest individuals in the world. Beware of "Bitters." ONE of the most prolific sources of dyspepsia, as well as a direct cause of a large share of the drunkenness in the land, is the rapidly increas-ing use of " bitters," " tonics," " blood foods," " restoratives," and kindred quack nostrums. These are usually represented as being wholly harmless and unintoxicating, while it is a well ascertained fact that some of them contain nearly sixty per cent of pure alcohol, or six per cent more than the strongest Scotch or Irish whisky. There are thousands of men who consider them-selves strictly temperate, who are as entirely de-pendent upon their matutinal draught of " bitters " as is the habitual drunkard upon his morning dram. The city of New York contains several hundred young ladies, the elite of the city, who have become hopelessly enslaved to the intoxica-ting glass by the use of these so-called harm-less " bitters." Even some professed hygienists do not hesitate to " aid their digestion," as they say, by the fre-quent use of these filthy compounds. under the  delusion that they are vegetable, and not injuri-ous. They are, in fact, making use of poor whis-ky which is disguised with various sickening and poisonous herbs. But one of the most infamous outrages con-nected with the whole business of making and selling this " bottled death," is the swindle known as " Walker's Vinegar Bitters." The manufac-tures claim that this article contains no alcohol, and is, consequently, not intoxicating. A baser falsehood than this could not be framed. Before us lies an analysis of these same " Vinegar Bitters," recently made by H. W. Vaughan, State Assayer for New York. This analysis shows that a bottle of the compound contains nearly twice as much alcohol as an equal quantity of many kinds of ale, and as much as many of the light wines. In addition to this large quantity of alcohol, the " bitters " contain a great amount of acetic acid which destroys the delicate membranes of the stomach and gives rise to the most obstinate con-stipation. Among the patients who come to the Institute for treatment, there are often individuals whose digestive organs have been terribly injured by this nefarious mixture. Again we say, Be-ware of " Bitters." None of them are harmless. All alike are filthy compounds of various poisons with bad whisky. Hygiene and the Temperance Movement. As Christian hygienists and health reform-ers, we always hail with joy the advent of any movement which promises to call the attention of the people to any of the many great evils which impede civilization and antagonize Christianity. Intemperance stands in the foremost rank of these baneful influences, and hence we have been ex-ceedingly gratified to witness the wonderful inter-est which has been manifested in combatting it during the few months since the inauguration of the " Temperance Crusade " by the women of Ohio. We have felt much interest in the move-ment, and have narrowly watched its workings, hoping that much good might result ; and such we believe has been the case. Public attention has been turned toward the subject in a very au-spicious manner. Many drunkards have been re-claimed, and not a few liquor saloons closed. This much we hoped for, and we have not been dis-appointed. But, notwithstanding our good wishes for the success of this movement, and our confidence that a measure of good would be accomplished, we have felt it quite proper to call attention to what
