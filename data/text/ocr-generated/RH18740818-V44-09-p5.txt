Now, in regard to these divisions and ions, they doubtless grew out of the peculiar cumstances surrounding the church. They seem to have been natural divisions, and are not specially spoken of as of divine appointment, to be uated in just the same form or name. As they preached in various places, and persons embraced the gospel, it would be proper to have them left in such a shape as would be most likely to keep them pure and efficient. The simplest means that could effect this object, would be the one to choose. Persons who were converted in the same city, or town, would associate together, hold ings together, and of course would be best fied to know of each other's spiritual standing and true character. Hence the necessity of local churches taking cognizance of their own members and attending to their own local affairs. These would have their local officers, such as elders, deacons, and clerks. But as the!'le local churches had a love for the general interests of the cause, they would rally become acquainted with those of the same faith within easy access, and thus a-ssociations· would be formed, and consultations held, ing that which mutually interested them, cially with those of the same nationality and guage. These would be of greater or less extent according to circumstances. It matters little whether we call these conferences, councils, ods, ?r associations. are divisions naturally growmg out of the circumstances surrounding them. The:n it must be evident that occasions would arise when questions must be decided of general interest to the whole body of believers which none of these minor bodies could settle for all, seeing any one of them would have just the same ity to do it that the other had. Such occasions would demand representatives from all. Hence the necessity for general councils or conferences of all concerned. And whether these should be called at regular intervals, or only occasionally, would be merely a question of expediency for those to decide who were interested. In all ages, and in all sect•, the necessity for some such eral arrangement has existed. The leave the minor questions concerning these ions to those interested. But they plainly show us that these general principles concerning them were recognized anciently the same as now. We can easily conclude that questions coming up for settlement, involving important points of interest in the local churches, would be referred to those councils, representing larger till the beat wisdom of the body was found. So far as offices and gifu; are concerned, there seems to have been quite a variety of them in the ancient church, of both a general and local acter. Among these are apostles, prophets, gelists, teachers, workers of miracles, helps, elders, deacons, &c. Some of these seem to be officers pointed to fill certain positions, having special du· ties pointed out for them to do, and for which they must have certain qualifications. Then others mentioned channels through which the Holy Spirit seemed specially to speak. We have no dence to show that these latter were appointed to any position by their brethren. Yet they doubtless had much influence in guiding the actions of the · church, as it would be very natural to reason that when the Holy Spirit chose them they must he worthy, and so, of course, their influence would be greater. Among the former were apostles, evangelists, teachers, elders, and deacons. Among the latter were prophets, workers of miracles, those who spoke with tongues, &c. Oftentimes individuals chosen to fill the offices of the church had these supernatural gifts also. But it seems evident that some of those who have these miraculous gifts, were not placed in any ficial position. Of course we have nothing to do in the church with the selection of this latter class. God chooses them, and we judge of their being chosen by the manifestation of his Spirit through them. That these gifts are not in such general exercise in our time as in the apostolic church, we all mit. But occasionally they have been seen, and the Scriptures plainly teach that they were designed for the church till the close of time; so that dently the main reason why they are not more erally in exercise is because of the lukewarm, worldly condition of the church in these latter days. The office of apostle was a very prominent one in the early church. It would be thought very improper, not to say fanatical, to apply that title to any officer of our modern churches. And yet the derivation of the word in the Greek would not make it improper to apply it to certain viduals raised up by the special providence of God to perform his work. The word signifies " one sent with a message," and the term was idently applied to the original twelve because of their being selected in an especial manner to do the work of God. It was applied to a number of others besides them, such as l\latthias, bas, Paul, Epaphroditus, Silvanus, and Timothy. Some of these are not thus called in the common translation, but they are in the Greek. The ber twelve seems to be chosen to correspond with the twelve tribes of Israel. When Juda.s tized, another was chosen to fill his place. We are not informed whether there was ever another election to this office, though others certainly ADVENT REVIE'V AND HERALD OF THE 69 were apostles. We are nowhere informed that it was the duty of the church to select individuals to fill this office in succeeding ages, though it would be reasonable to expect that when the providence of God made it manifest that he had raised up a man to do a special work in his cause, the church should cheerfully give him his proper degree of influence and position. The office of evangelist corresponds with our minister. The word in the original mfies "one who announces glad tidings." The wo:ds and pastor have the general catiOn of Instructors, who are to watch over and impart knowledge of divine truth, such as would be needed. The word episcopos in the Greek from which elder and bishop are usually lated, signifies an inspector or overseer one who superintends or provides for the welfa;e of any one. This term is applied to those who act in the general capacity of teachers and evanO'elists and also to those in a more· limited as 'local elders. This latter office is a principal one in the tian. church, .and the are given very parttcularly m the ep1stles to Timothy and Titus. Those acted in a ge_neral capacity had the oversight of churches m large sections of country. They were to look after their spiritual wants generally. It was their duty to reprove the admonish those in danger, stimulate the to action, comfort the desponding, see that those m lower offices were faithful and watch over all for their good, as well as to' teach the· way of life and salvation. Their office was such that necessarily a great burden of responsibility would rest upon them, and the prosperity of the, church would largely depend upon their fatthfulness. These general duties will always lie before the servants of the Lord in every age, an_d the church cannot prosper unless they are faithful. The character of the churches in eral will be largely determined by the character of their officers. The office of deacon was one which pertained largely to the temporal affairs of the church. He'' was to look after the wants of the afflicted, to act as treasurer, and hold the money received for various purposes, furnish things necessary for sacramental purposes, and then take the oversight of temporal matters. The qualifications for this office are also plainly given. Paul of "helps" among the gifts set in the cliurch. These were doubtless ants, who might have been acting in the capacity of deacons, or, perhaps, were not elected to any office, but chose freely, of their own accord, to act with others, and help them all they could. It would be a great blessing to the church if there were more persona in this age ready to thus act a benevolent part in the work of God. Here is a great field of usefulness open for vohmteers to fill. While they who labor in word and trine find, if willing, more than they can do, and are always anxious for help, it will ever be to them a matter of deep rejoicing to find those who can help stepping in to aid in the good work. Many might act in this capacity had they the disposition. While officers in the church have great sibilities upon them, it should never be forgotten that their powers are merely advisory. The body of the church is the deciding power. ders can advise, reprove, or rebuke, but they cannot turn out or take in members, only as they can persuade the church to act. They will of course have a great influence, but they are never to act as "lords over God's heritage," but as examples to the flock, counselors, and advisers. GEo. I. BuTLER. Religion and Charity. RELIGION, as a principle, seems to be a sense of the moral obligation which binds us in duty to God. True religion binds us to the one living and true God. Hence that which acknowledges more gods than one, we call false religion. cording to an apostle of Jesus Christ, there is a " pure religion and undefiled," hence we rightly infer that not all that is called religion, or fesses to be such, is of this character, but it may be of an opposite character-impure and defiled. 1\'Ian seems disposed tu have some sort of ligion; but often ignores, or even rejects, the true, and embraces the false. And as it was the case in ancient times, and is now in heathen lands, that the people have worshiped many gods, and consequently their religion has been false, is it npt possible that even now among the many discordant sects professing the religion of the Bible, there may be much religion that is false? The great fundamental principle of the doctrine of the Bible is love-supreme love to God, and love to our neighbor equal to our love of selves. " And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; this is the first and great commandment. · And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other mandment greater than these." Mark 12: 30, 31. The whole moral law of God, the ten mandments, depends upon; teaches, and enforces, these two great principles. " On these two mandments hang all the law and the 
prophets." Matt. 22:40. The ten commandments teach us how to love God and our neighbor. Four of them teach our duty in reference directly to God ; three are expreesed negatively, forbidding other gods, the making and worshiping of images, and the taking of the name of God in vain ; the fourth demands that God be positively honored by an observance of the memorial of his creative work. These are duties directly to God, and indirectly to our neighbor, as setting him an example. The other six to our duty directly to our neighbor, and. to God ; for we have the inspired dec1s1on, "That he who loveth God love his brother also." See 1 John 4: 20, 21. Now we may say that we love God, but this is not sufficient proo£ "For this is the love of God, that we keep his ; and his commandments are not gnevous." l John 5:3. But many in this our day have attempted to make their love to God excuse them from keeping his commandments. They have argued that these commandments have been superseded by the great precepts of love to God and man-precepts which they are pleased to call gospel precepts, ignoring the fact, that they are the great commandments "in the law "-so that they are no longer bound to keep the commandmentpl but "only to love God with all the heart." One who was makino this plea to excuse himself from keeping the mandments of God, was asked what he would do supposing his little son, instead of doing what he bid him do, should stand and say, "I love you I 1 , ' pa, ove you ; and he was constrained to reply "I'd whip him." Now, since the love of God cannot exist out a cheerful obedience to his commandments what shall we do in the case of those who to love God and do not keep all his ments? Shall we charitably (?) refrain from pointing out their error, and bid them God speed, on the ground that all will be right in the end, if the heart is only right? 'Vould it not be better and more charitable to show them from the word of God what he requires of them as proof of their love? "But men differ concerning what God requires in his commandments." Are the commandments so expressed that they necessarily lJ.nd unavoidably differ as to the duties which they require? Then, truly, the fault is in the law. But what can be a greater sign of the deep depravity of the human heart than excusing our errors and disobedience by attaching the fault to the law and the blame to the Giver? It is false! it is fulse! 1\Ien can understand what God requires of them in the ten precepts of the decalogue, if they will try. I cannot, 
must net, dishonor God by admitting the contrary. "Let God be true," though it prove "every man a liar." Wherever false religion exists, it demands a false charity. Those who have worshiped many gods could well afford to place their various gods upon a level. One was as good as another, since all were false ; therefore they could ha.ve charity one for another. And there could be no able objection to the worship of the one living and true God. And there would be none, but for the uncharitable exclusiveness of this religion -a religion that assumes that it alone is right, and, as a consequence, that all others are wrong. On of this uncharitable, bigoted, fanatical exclusiveness, the worshipers of a plurality of gods have always a pique against those who will admit but one God, and have thought that if they could only rid the earth of these, peace, mony, and charity, would prevail in all the world. Hence the persecutions ; not because there were too many gods and too many religions, but because of the uncharitableness and exclusiveness of one which assumes alone to be right, and, in so doing, condemns all the rest. There are errors in the Christian world to-day. Where theories conflict and practices contradict, all cannot be true. But, after centuries of tation and disunion, there seems to be a tendency to union ; not a union effected by abandonin[l' rors and embracing the truth, but by an ed charity that puts truth and error upon a level -a union upon the doctrine that it makes no difference what one's faith and practice is, in ters of worship, only if he is not exclusive and uncharitable. And this union, it is thought, will soon introduce the fancied millennium, when all the world will be converted to the pure and defiled religion of Jesus Christ. The character or this union may be inferred from the following quotation from the American Messflflger. In the conclusion of an article upon "the great and bright revival movement in land," the writer says, "The extent to which ' brethren ' now ' dwell together in unity' was also adverted to, and should not be overlooked. 'At the meetings,' said one of the speakers,' no one could tell, from the language of any present, to what particular branch of the church universal each belonged, so completely had all come gether in the love of Christ, the ' unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace.'" Such a union of discordant sects-ignoring their differences, and putting truth and error on the same level is hailed as the harbinger of good to the world. But when such a union comes well established, woe to the exclusive and uncharitable wretch who stands firmly upon ble truth ! It is a union, it is thought, upon the great essentials, that is, upon the points wherein the mass· agree ; but this makes the distinctive doctrines and practices of the church, as taught in the Scriptures, non-essential. In such a union one may be immersed, sprinkled, or poured, as baptism, or not be baptized at all, and it is all the same, if his conscience is only satisfied ; ing the conscience of each individual the judge of duty, instead of being ruled by the word of God. And concerning the Sabbath, he may hold the commandment binding, the requmng observance of a particular day, or that it is ished and that there is no sacred time ; that a particular 4ay, the first day of the week, is the Sabbath, or that only a seventh part of time or one day in seven is all that is required-that every day is the Sabbath, or that no day is the Sabbath-provided he conforms to the ble observance of the first day of the week; or, perhaps he might be allowed to keep the seventh day-the day mentioned in the provided he claims no pre-eminence for that day, but places it on a level with all other days, cially the first day of the week. But all faithful and persistent adherence to what God has said is ruled out of such a union as exclusiveness. If one insisU! that what God has said is superior to all that men have substituted in its place, he has no place in such a union, but is a fit subject of proscription and persecution. And this liberal union, and this broad charity, which ignores the word of God, is expected to be the basis of the millennium ! How much better to come back to the word of God and unite upon the truth. R. F. COTTRELL. "NoT forsaking the assembling of oune!Yes gether," Heb. 10: 25. A regular and constant effort put forth in the common persuits of life is generally crowned with at least some degree of success. So in spiritual things, God has laid a plan for man's salvation. The seasons of secret and social prayer, the bath with its holy influence, the influence of the good, the Bible and all the varied means of grace, if well improved, prove a rich savor of life unto life. The stated meetings of the church, cially, are a powerful means of grace. Those who attend these with a proper spirit of devotion reap a rich reward. The camp-meetings are an interel:lting feature in the work and gt·eat leges are afforded to those who attend these ings, and great loss attends the neglect of them. Only a few short years remain, and when these expire, all will be over. Well it is that the ple of God hold yearly religious anniversaries. These are seasons of great importance to all who value eternal life ; and as they return in their yearly round, they seem like mile-posts to the lestial city. Every year, these meetings rise in their interest and power, and well will it be for us if we rise with them. J os. CLARKE. Too Busy. FoR what? To spend time in attending scenes of amusement or parties of pleasure? No, not that. To stop to read important news, or, what is worse, the light and tious literature of the day? Not that either. Well, what then? Too busy to attend Conference. So said a first-day Adventist who called at the tent the other day, in swer to the inquiry whether he attended a session of the Conference recently held not far from where he lived. After replying in the negative, he added with some emphasis, " It is too busy a time for me to attend ference." True, the season is late and the weather unfavorable; still I could but tally ask, How much faith can such have in the soon coming of the Lord? or how much do they appreciate the preparation needed for that event? And I was also led to reflect as to how many S. D. Adventists within the bounds of the Conference will be absent from our pected camp-meeting for the same reason. It is painfully certain there will be some. But I hope we begin to see the danger of being blinded by the god of this world, and the necessity of seeking first the kingdom of God to that degree that the number of such will be materially lessened, and that we shall see at that meeting such a rally of earnest, determined seekers after God as has never been in this State. Brethren and sisters, just as many of you as can, come, even at a sacrifice. Show your faith by your works, and let it be seen that your heart is in the coming kingdom instead of this world. And not only be in earnest to come, but in earnest to work, in Garnest to seek God when there, and even now, while making preparation to go. Do not come simply cause Bro. snd sister White are expected (for which I am thankful), but cause God in his providence is furnishing you with just the help you need at this time, and without which your prospects of success in overcoming will be very much injured, to say the least. Especially do I hope the friends in· the northern part of the State will appreciate the favor shown them. You have desired the meeting to be in September to date you better. In the providence of God, this is brought about. Now show your itude by improving the opportunity thus ciously offered you. Time is short, the work is great, dangers are many; but life is cious, rest is sweet, and these we must gain, at any cost. S. B. W HITYEY. West Hebron, N. Y., A1rg. 1874.
