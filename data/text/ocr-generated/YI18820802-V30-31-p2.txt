Ł 122 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. Vol. 80, No. 81 ronized as it is. Here the poor man can take his family, away from the close, dingy city, and, free from care and labor, "Look through nature up to nature's God." The student of natural history may also find here something of interest to him. In a large basin, supplied with cold, fresh water from a never-failing artesian well, may be seen a couple of sea-lions, basking in the water, as though they were in the sea. Further on are large cages containing al-ligators, turtles, owls, eagles, doves, squirrels, crows, Guinea fowls, prairie chickens, quails, &c. At another place are dens, containing wild cats, foxes, wolves, bears, raccoons, &c. One of the most interesting sights, and one which continually attracts a great many people, is a colony of prairie dogs. They are enclosed in a hol-low, from which they cannot escape, and in this they have their mounds and holes. They do not seem to be very industrious, as they appear to be continually playing. Their amusing antics are watched by a great many people. All of these an-imals are in a public place in the park, where they may be seen free of charge. These places of resort are certainly a great ben-efit, especially to the poorer classes in the cities, and the city governments are certainly deserving of praise for their kindly efforts in the direction of furnishing public places of rest and recuperation for the weary, confined city duellers, and of im-proving and beautifying the surroundings of the people. A B. OvEN. "COME ALONG, BROTHER." "WHY! what is the matter, Uncle Robert ?" asked Herbert in astonishment, as his uncle laughed out loud, and laughed and laughed again. " I'll try to tell you," responded Uncle Robert. " I was thinking of the old rhyme that we used to sing when we were boys and girls . "If I had a donkey and he wouldn't go, Do you think I'd wallop him? Oh, no! no I I'd give him some corn, and I'd say, Go on, Gee up Neddy " and then I thought of a story that I had read one day, and the comical picture with which it was il-lustrated. As I thought of all this, I thought of a boy I know andŠ " Oh, but please never mind about the boy, un-cle ; tell me about the donkey," interrupted Her-bert. "I will. Some men wished to get a donkey on board a ship, but vainly attempted to induce him to walk the gang plank, which led from the pier to the vessel. Threats and angry words failed, and so did beating and kicking. "By and by one of the men positively put his arms around the donkey's neck, and in the most coaxing manner possible, said to the obstinate donkey : ' Come along, brother.' Would you believe it ?Šaway went the donkey most contentedly. The by-standers laughed, but, Herbert, I could not help thinking you might get a suggestion here." " Why, uncle, what could I learn from a don-key 7 " " To tell you the truth, nephew, it was some-thing concerning yourself that led me to think of the donkey. Did not a boy whom you know, this very morning, get very angry because his brother would not come and play with him ? Did he not threaten to tell father, and call his disobliging brother ugly names ?" A strong glow of crimson rose just at this time to Herbert's cheeks, that said, 'Yes,' as distinctly as lips could have spoken it. " Now, nephew, that boy failed to make his brother budge an inch, and so he has been lone- some and miserable for an hour or more. For fut-ure guidance, I am going to suggest the use of what I shall call the 'Come-along-brother' plan. Do you understand ?" Uncle Robert was quite sure that Herbert did understand, when, not many hours after, he heard the merry shouts of the lad and his brother Willie in the garden. Though proof against threats and anger, Willie had yielded to Uncle Robert's " Come-along-brother " plan. Ł " Upon my word," said the good hearted man, "I do believe my remedy is like some of those nostrums advertized everywhere, which are war-ranted equally good for man and beast; and, after all, there is a good deal of the donkey nature in every one of us."ŠNew York Observer. THE SCARECROW. THOSE are the robbers! " grandpa said .To neighbor's boy, Gold-locks, and Ted, Out on the doorstep. As he spoke, Over toward a distant oak He pointed, where in fluttering rows Were perched the black and noisy crows Brown, and smelling an earthy sweet, The field spread out beneath the heat, With faintest lines of green to show Where the corn had just begun to grow; Hither had come the thieves in flocksŠ"Little black hens," said wise Gold-locks. " What shall we do? " with aspect grim, To the three small folks who watched with him, Said grandpaŠhe whose gentle hand Spared even the spoilers of his land, And who always planted thoughtfully With an eye to squirrel, bird, and bee: His frown was only a thin disguise To hide the gentleness of his eyes; For the veriest worm before his tread Could lift unhurt its humble head. But Ted, half cheated by his tone, Thought gravely something must be done. " We'll build a scarecrow, Jack, hurrah!" (Hark! distant answerŠ" Caw, caw, caw! ") And, glad of a novel work to do, Up to the attic stores they flew; Sought for the worst of everything; Then off to the field went scampering. There, soon, a figure gaunt uprose, With grandpa's long-discarded clothes Hung from its limbs, no fit at all, Too large in parts, in parts too small, His bat upon its bristling hair, Waving a threatening arm in air. What did the sentry on the bough Say to his pilfering comrades now? Why, when the direful thing be saw, He croaked serenely, "Caw, ca-aw, ca-a-w!" And still along the corn's green track Stalked the thieves in glistening black. Never a stately step showed fright, Never a wing took hurried flight; But still the flocks came, day by day, To find where the yellow kernels lay. No whit did the saucy creatures care For the broom the scarecrow waved in air. Gold-locks puzzled her little mind, The secret of their ways to find; She pondered; counseled much with Ted, And, at lastŠa bright discoveryŠsaid: "I know: if we wanted to scare the crows, We should n't have put on grandpa's clothes! " ŠWide Awake. I CAN AND I WILL. How MANY boys there are who can, but never do, because they have no will power, or, if they have, do not use it ! Before undertaking to per-form any task, you must carefully consider whether you can do it, and once convinced that you are able to accomplish it, then say, "I will do it," with a determination that you will never give it up till it  is done, and you will be successful. The difference between "Give up" and "I can't" and "I can and I will" is just the difference between victory and de-feat in all the great conflicts of life. Boys, adopt for your motto, "If I can, I will," and victory will be yours in all life's battles. "I can and I will" nerves the arm of the world's he-roes to-day, in, whatever department of labor they are engaged. "I can and I will" has fought and. won all the great battles of life and of the world. I know of a boy who was preparing to enter the Junior Class of the New York University. He was studying trigonometry, and'I gave him three examples for his next lesson. The following day, he came into my room to demonstrate his problems. Two of them he understood, but the thirdŠa very difficult oneŠhe had not performed. I said to him :Š " Shall I help you ?" "No, sir, I can and I will do it if you will give me time." I said, "I will give you all the time you wish." The next day he came into my room to recite another lesson in the same study. "Well, Simon, have you worked out that exam-ple 7 " "No, sir I " he answered, "bub I can and will do it, if you will give me a little more time." "Certainly, you shall have all the time you de- sire." 1 always like these boys who are determined to do their own work, for they make our best scholars, and men, too. The third morning, you should have seen Simon enter my room. I knew he had it, for his whole face told the story of his success. Yes, he had it, notwithstanding it had cost him many hours of the severest labor. Not only had he solved the problem, but what was of infinitely greater importance to him, he had begun to develop mathematical powers which, under the inspiration of "I can and I will," he has continued to culti- vate, until to-day he is professor of mathematics in one of our largest colleges, and is one of our ablest mathematicians of his years in the country. My dear young friends, let your motto ever be : "If I can, I will."ŠGolden Days. AGAINST JESUS. WHEN it is remembered that Jesus left his glory in heaven, came down to earth, and took on himself the form of a servant, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross, to save the children of men from that eternal ruin to which they had exposed themselves by sin, it would seem impossible that a human heart could be found that was against him. To be against one who had always sought our ruin would not seem strange, but to be against one who did more to prove his love for us than all beside, is so strange that we cannot account for it in any other way than to conclude that the spirit of the great enemy of Jesus, Satan, must dwell in human hearts. Jesus himself says, "He that is not for me is against me." To be for Jesus is to believe in the heart that he is what he claims to be, "The Christ, the Son of the living God"Šthat he is right on all questions upon which he has expressed his mind, and then take a stand with him, advocate his cause, and oppose everything that he would op-pose. How many of us are thus for Jesus I Remem-ber that it matters not what our claims to moral-ity may be, what our profession may be, if we are not over on his side really and actively, we are regarded by him as against him. Can it be that many of our dear young readers are against Jesus? See once where you are. Oh, do be the friends of Jesus, for he is indeed your dearest friend.
