Facts are proving that we have none too many schools; they are all needed at the present time, and we hope more will be needed not far in the future. There is no agency being called into requisition which does better work for the cause of God than do our schools. Again we say to our people in be-half of our schools: Send them scholars, and they will return you workers. Great Controversy, Vol. 4. THIS volume will soon be ready for delivery. In preparing some of the last chapters for the press, it was our privilege to read them, and we esteem it a privilege indeed. We are thankful that it is so nearly out, feeling assured that it will be a benefit to its readers. It seems to us that we never esteemed the "present truth" so highly as we have since reading some of the contents of this book. It will be larger than either of the three volumes of the set, which precede it. The amount of matter prepared for it makes this unavoidable. The price is, however, the same, just as it has been advertised. We believe that the reading of this volume will prove a great blessing to our churches, and to the cause of truth. When we read such thrilling de-scriptions of the time of trouble, the deliverance of the saints, and the glory to be revealed, we can realize what it is to "rejoice with trembling," and to worship with "gladness and fear." Thank God for "that blessed hope." Titus 2 :13. Preserve Your Signs. ONE volume of the.SioNs OF THE TIMES contains over 700 pages of solid reading matter of the most interesting and instructive character. During the course of the year articles are written on nearly every phase of every Bible subject. Series of arti-cles on important subjects are given, and obscure and difficult texts are explained. Besides this, there are valuable articles on practical Christianity, instructive stories for the family, temperance and missionary statistics, and reports of the progress of the cause in various parts of the world. The whole volume contains a variety and amount of useful matter that would cost ten times as much if pur-chased in any other form, provided it could be ob-tained anywhere else. The last number of each volume contains a complete index, so that out of the great mass of miscellaneous matter, the reader can at any time refer to that which he wants. In every paper there are articles that should re-ceive more than a casual reading; they should be studied with care. If the papers are not preserved, the subscriber does not realize one-half the benefit from them that he should. But how shall the papers be preserved? Laying them away on a shelf is a very unsatisfactory way, for the trouble of handling over a pile of papers to find a certain number, is so great that it will seldom be undertaken. And in that case, the probability is that the papers will soon be used in ways not de-. signed by the publisher. Many, no doubt, would like to save their papers and have them bound, but the trouble of saving them all till the end of the year is too great. . To all who wish to keep their papers for future ref- erence, and to those who have not yet thought of it but ought to, we recommend the patent binder. The office is now prepared to furnish these hi any quantity. They are prepared especially for the SIGNS in its present form, with the name SIGNS OF THE TIMES stamped in gilt letters on the back. With one of these, each subscriber can bind his own papers as they come, and thus have them always accessible, and in a style neat enough for the center-table. The binder holds one or two copies as securely as it does the whole volume. One minute spent when your paper first comes will enable you to keep it for-ever. Directions for using accompany the binder. Price, post-paid, $1.00. New England Camp-Meeting. THE camp-meeting for the four New England States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, will be held on the Fair Ground in the city of Worcester, Mass., commencing Aug. 21, and continuing to Sept. 2. This will be as important a camp-meeting as has ever been held by S. D. Adventists in this part of the country. The success of the meeting last year, held at this place, in awakening a general interest not only in the city of Worcester, but in the surrounding country, has led the friends of the cause to make a more ex-tensive preparation for the meeting this year than they have previously made. Preaching services will be held in the large pavil-ion, 80x125 feet. Smaller tents will be used for meetings especially designed to instruct our brethren in the different branches of the work. Family tents varying in size from 10x12 to 18x24 feet can be pur-chased or rented for the occasion. The sum charged for the use of tents during the meeting, will vary from three to seven dollars, according to the size. Persona wishing to rent or purchase, should imme-diately correspond with Eld. D. A. Robinson, South Lancaster, Massachusetts, stating the size they de-sire, or how many persons they wish to accommo-date in a tent. Worcester is a city of about sixty thousand inhabitants, while, in a radius of ten miles, there are many towns and villages, the most of them connected with Worcester by railroads, over which several trains pass daily. It is the most central lo-cation for the four States comprising the New Eng-land Conference, being a railroad center for all of the New England States excepting Maine. Those coming from the latter State can come direct to Wor-cester over the Portland, Rochester and Nashua Rail-road, or by boat to Boston. Free returns to Roches-ter by rail. Persona at Martha's Vineyard, New Bedford, and all towns south of Boston on the Old Colony Rail-road, also those from Newburyport, Haverhill, Dan-vers, Ipswich, Reading, and from all points on the Eastern and Boston and Maine roads, also all in towns adjoining Boston, should come to Boston, and there take the train at the Fitchburg depot for Wor-cester. By coming from Boston over this line you can secure, on the camp-ground, a free return check to Boston. Remember that the Boston and Albany  road grants us no reduction, therefore, be sure and come over the Fitchburg line. Those coming from New Ipswich, Greenville, Wil-ton, Temple, and adjacent towns, should take the cars at Greenville for Ayer Junction, and there change for Worcester. Those coming from Marlboro and Hudson, should take the cars at South Acton and change for Worces-ter. All who come from Zoar, Buckland, Shelbourne, Greenfield, Athol, and all points on the Fitchburg road, west of Fitchburg, should come to Fitchburg, and there change for Worcester. Accommodations will be provided for all who may come. Expenses will not be heavy. We are anxious to see all of our friends at this meeting, together with those who have been reading our periodicals. We hope that this camp-meeting will be as successful as any that has ever been held in New England. We ask our friends to remember it, in their prayers, and to at once make arrangements to attend. A cordial welcome will be extended to all who come upon the ground. S. N.ŁHASKELL. Maine Camp-Meeting. THOSE coming to the meeting from the East will stop at Woodford's Corner, and take the horse-cars, which stop at the camp-ground. Half-fare is granted by the Maine Central Railroad, and its branches, to those who wish to attend Ł the camp-meeting. Reduced fare can be obtained on the Grand Trunk Railroad by presenting a certificate, signed by the Camp-meeting Committee, stating that the bearer will a' tend the meeting. Half-fare will probably be granted by the Ogdensburg Railroad. Those com-ing over the Ogdensburg and Boston, and Maine Railroads will stop at the transfer station and take the Maine Central Railroad to Woodford's Corner, and the horse-cars from there as above directed. The camp-meeting will be held in Deering, just out of Portland. A very pleasant spot of ground has been secured, as will be seen by a perusal of the article descriptive of the grounds in another col-umn. All are invited to come and hear, and then judge. J. B. GOODRICH. A PRIVATE letter from Eld. E. R. Jones brings tidings of success in the tent-meeting in Denver, Col. He is of good courage, and hopeful for the work there.
