PASTEURIZED MILK.Š When the fact was discov- ‚4 ered that milk is frequently a means of communicat-ing the infection of typhoid fever, cholera, and other germ diseases, the suggestion was soon made that as a means of preventing these infectious dis-eases, milk should invariably be sterilized by pro-longed boiling. Later experiments, however, have shown that the prolonged boiling of milk to some degree modifies its constituents and lessens its value as a food. The fact that boiled milk has a ten-dency to produce inactivity of the bowels is one with which even the laity are quite familiar. Pas-teur, by careful experimentation, discovered long ago that heating milk for ten or fifteen minutes to a temperature of 16o° will destroy the disease produc- ts Mg microbes which it contains, and to such an extent destroy the microbes which set up decomposition in milk and allied substances, as to considerably in-crease its keeping qualities. Doubtless most physicians are aware of this fact, and yet the frequency with which we hear boiled milk recommended as an article of food, especially for young infants, leads us to believe that the profes-sion do not so generally utilize this important fact as it would be in the interest of their patients for them to do. It is rarely necessary to recommend Ł EDITORIAL. 249 familiar with the story of Charles Lamb, who visited a cheesemonger's late at night for the purpose of obtaining a supply of cheese for his maiden sister, who thought it impossible to go to bed without a bit of toasted cheese. He was asked by the merchant who was cutting off the cheese, " Shall I send it home, Mr. Lamb ? " "No," said the wag, who had noticed the lively character of the cheese, " Lend me a string and I will lead it home." In making out a market report not long ago, a newspaper reporter mentioned that cheese had " moved down a point or two," which he intimated was not surprising, as the stock had been some- time on hand. We recall also the remark of a guest at a hotel on one occasion, who, when asked by the waiter if he should remove the cheese, replied, "It is quite unnecessary sir, as it is evidently quite able to take itself away." An article which depends for its sup-posed savory properties upon the presence and activity of millions of putrefactive germs and other products, and which is not infrequently a wriggling mass of living animalculm, certainly cannot be considered as a wholesome article of food by persons who hold their stomachs in due regard, and place a right esti-mate upon the value of a good digestion. FRENCH COFFEE.ŠThose of our readers who con-template visiting Paris, and are likely while there to indulge in that famous beverage, "French coffee," may be interested in the fact that a recent number of a Paris journal gives as the composition of French coffee, the following : " Roasted horse liver, roasted black walnut sawdust, and caramel, or burned sugar." The imported French coffee obtainable in this country doubtless has the same composi-tion.  boiled milk for a child, or indeed for a patient of any age. Instruction should be given that the milk be heated to a temperature of 6o° for fifteen min-utes. After heating, the milk should be cooled as quickly as possible, and kept cool until used ; unless it is desired that it should be taken hot, when it may be heated just before being taken. TUBERCULOUS MEAT.ŠThere can be no doubt that the danger from the use of the flesh of tuberculous animals is increasing. This danger is also likely to continue to increase as our country becomes more thickly settled, and as the germs of tuberculosis be-come more widely dispersed. In old countries, like France, this danger is recognized more clearly than in this country. Stringent inspection laws require the inspection of all slaughtered cattle, both before and after killing, in France; but in this country only a very small proportion of the beef eaten has been subjected to anything like a careful inspection. In-deed, it is doubtful whether the inspection service in relation to the flesh of diseased animals is ever what it should be in this country, in which matters of this sort are treated with much less care than in most foreign countries. Another evil which is justly complained of in France is the fact that only animals in which the tuberculous infection can be recognized as generally dispersed through the body are rejected. In cases in which the disease seems to be confined to one or two organs, inspectors simply condemn the infected organs, allowing the remainder to be sold for con-sumption as food. According to statistics presented by Dr. Deshayes (Revue d' Hygiene, Dec. 20, 1893), many thousands of tuberculous cattle are eaten in France annually.
