was found whom we considered might suit this ap-plicant, and the child was finally received into her home. The lady writes as follows in regard to her:Š " When I took her, some five weeks ago, it was on trial ; and when I showed her to her room, I told her that I had prepared it for a little girl whom I had failed to get, and was now looking for another. Before the third day was ended, she begged earnestly to be allowed to be that other little girl.' I had by that time made up my mind that she was the Lord's choice for me, so I gave consent. For a while she was very happy, but by and by her joy seemed clouded and she asked sadly, Mamma, could n't you take two little girls ? What will become of the little girl whom you would have taken if you had n't given the home to me ? ' Nothing I could say pacified her ; she evidently had a heartache for the unknown homeless child. Finally I proposed a that we .a.r,k God to give that child a good home and a kind mother. Since then she has not even spoken of her. She cast the burden on the Lord. " She knew the Lord's Prayer but nothing about personal petitions when she came to me. So as she knelt at my knee that first night, I told her she might ask the Lord for anything she really wanted for Jesus' sake, and that if it was best, she would surely get it ; but I gave no further bias to her prayer. It touches me to hear her never fail to pray for mother,' that God may keep her well and not let her get so tired, and help me to be a comfort to her,'Š all her own ideas and her own wording. "I am so thankful that I have her and not the child of my first choice. This little one fits into my home so well ; she is the right one, faults nothwithstanding and nevertheless. "I never tell a child that I do not love her because she is naughty, but that I love her just as much, only that it is with a sad sorry love when she is bad, and with a glad, proud love when she is good. This MŠ thoroughly understands. I think it is the secret of her steadily increasing love for me. She came to me yesterday and whispered, ' I love my mamma, for I just know I have the best mamma in all the world.' Someone asked her if she was happy here. Why, I am so happy here that I have to keep smiling all the time,' was her reply. I thank God for giving me just this child." F4 RELIEF DEPARTMENT. 255 0 WE have just received a letter from a little girl who has been in her new home about six months, stating that she has a lovely home and has not been homesick ; also that her mother teaches her to be a good girl. IN our Relief Department each month are offered opportunities for persons to accept the privilege of training some child for a life of usefulness. Many lives might be made happy by we rking for some unfortunate child. If circumstances are such that a child cannot be taken into one's own home, perhaps someone may be found near by who is longing to give kind, motherly attention to some orphan child. PERSONS making applications for children adver-tised in this department are requested to send with  their applications the names and addresses of two or more persons as reference. If possible these should be known, either personally or by reputation, to some member of the Board of Trustees. VISITING DAYS AT THE HASKELL HOME. PERSONS intending to visit the Haskell Home will please note that the visiting days are Sunday, 4 to 6 P. M., and Wednesday, 2 to 6 P. M. It is necessary to make this announcement, as so large a number of visitors have been calling at the Home that the very interest of the friends, which we have no desire to discourage, has been something of a hindrance to the workers. .  J. H. KELLOGG. CLOTHING FOR THE POOR. THE call for clothing of all kinds and the numerous offers to supply assistance of this sort, have led us to organize a Clothing Department to receive and properly distribute new or partly worn garments which can be utilized for the relief of the very poor. In connection with this work it is very important that a few points should be kept in mind and carefully observed : Š I. Clothes that are so badly worn that repairs will cost more in money or labor than the garment is worth, will of course be of no service. Garments that are old, though faded, or which may be easily repaired by sewing up seams, or made presentable by a few stitches judiciously taken at some point in which the fabric is nearly worn through, may be utilized to most excellent advantage. But garments so badly worn that they need exten-sive patching, or clothes which have become much soiled and grimy by long use in some dirty occupation, should find their way to the rag bag instead of the missionary box. 2. Freight must always be prepaid. It costs as much to send 25 pounds or any amount less than too pounds as to send the full zoo pounds ; consequently it would be well for those who think of sending clothes to be used in this department, to put their contri-butions together in one shipment, so as to get the benefit of the roo-pound rates. We are obliged to ask that freight should be pre-paid as a means of preventing loss to the work in the payment of freight upon useless packages. 3. Clothes that have been worn by patients suffering from any contagious disease Š such as typhoid fever, erysipelas, con-sumption, and skin disorders of all sorts, as well as scarlet fever, measles, mumps, diphtheria, and smallpox Š should not be sent. Infected clothes may be rendered safe by disinfection, but we can-not trust to the proper disinfection of such garments by those sending them, who, in the majority of cases, are quite inexperi-enced in such work ; neither should those who unpack the clothes be exposed to the risk of contamination while preparing them for disinfection at this end of the line. Such clothes should, as a rule, be destroyed. If they are not destroyed, almost infinite pains is required to render their use perfectly safe. 4. All articles received here are carefully assorted and classi-fied, and are then placed as called for, where they will do the most good. 5. Clothing intended for the Chicago Medical Mission shOuld be sent to 40 Custom House Place, Chicago, Ill.
