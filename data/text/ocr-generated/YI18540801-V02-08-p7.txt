bor and there see a fine vessel all ready for sailing on the Ocean, and should ask the cap-tain for what port he was bound, and he should say, Oh to no place in particular; and then if you should ask him if he had a compass and and chart and quadrant by which he might tell the direction, the latitude and longitude in which he was sailing, and he should say, No, I do not need any ; I ask if you would like to go on board that boat, or wish your friends to do so? I think not. If you did go you might ex-pect to be dashed in pieces on the rocks in some heavy gale of wind. Now, my little friends, you have all started out on- the ocean of time and the boat you are sailing in is your little frail body, only kept above the waters by the power and kindness of your heavenly Captain, who wishes you to take the Word and Spirit, for your chart and compass. Now, will you do it? Will you watch and pray that your vessel may safely land in the port of Heaven, or will you through carelessness let your bark go down in the dark waters of perdition ? I think I hear you saying, I'll go no farther until I know that I have the smiles of Jesus, and am bound for his heavenly kingdom. # Your friend and well-wisher, H. G. Bucx.

DEAR CHILDREN :ŠWe are indeed greatly fa-vored in having God's precious Word, which points us to the blessed Saviour. And as I feel . a flame of sacred love kindle in my heart, and think of those dear young friends who number among God's litttle flock, the remnant, I con-sider myself happy in being privileged to ad-dress you in a few lines through the Instructor. I wish in simplicity to speak of the kind care-God has for you, and the love, with which he tenderly looks down upon youŁ and guards you from the wicked influences which daily sur-round you. He has kindly commissioned an an-gel to attend you in all your steps lest at any time you stray from virtue's path. He that clothes the lilies of the field, hath said, " The very hairs of your head are all numbered." Our blessed Lord when here upon earth, declared, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones 4  which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged' about Ilitoneck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea." Dear children, the Saviour now stands with arms outstretched, kindly inviting you, to turn from everything that is sinful and place your-selves under his kind care and protection. Yes, 0 yes, let us strive daily to enter into the ser- fvice of God with all our heart, and soon it will be said, " Come ye blessed of my Father, inher- ,._ From M. G. Kellogg. DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS :ŠGod has made a promise, that when Jesus, comes, he will re- deem all the good from-this wicked world, and give them a home in the bright world of glory. We all wish fo go there ;,but in order for us to get there, we have all 'got a work to do, which no one can do for us. We have all sinned and would have been lost if Christ had not died for us ; but since he died for us, we can be saved if we will keep the commandments of God,and the faith of Jesus. We must keep the Sabbath, and all the rest of the commandments, The fifth one was given expressly for children. It reads, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy dayS rimy be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee," The land ifiat he has promised to give us is this earth made new and glorious. Now, if you wish to live forever on the new earth where there will be no more pain nor sorrow, you must obey raur parents in the Lord ; and the apostle Paul tells us that this is the first commandment with promise. Eph. vi, 1, 2. Now the way to honor your pa-rents, is to obey them : if they tell you to do any thing you should do it cheerfully, you should be glad of the privilege of obeying them. I have seen children when their parents told them to do anything, they would say they did not wish to, they wait to be told two or three times, and then they wou'd be fretful. wcadd murmur and complain, and if they did what their patents told them, they would go about it pouting and-  do it in a very careless manner and act as though they did not care for any one. Such  iia  i 1 d r en do not honor their parents; but they d.dilionor them; and God is not well pleased wiffirtheir actions. God loves children when they love and obey their parents; and unless they do this they cannot be saved when Jesus comes; but they will be destroyed by the seven last plagues, though their parents do keep the commandments. You must hearken diligently to the instruc-tions of your parents; they are older than you are and they know a great deal more than you do; and you must listen tb their teaching. Hear what Solomon, the wise man, says in Prov. i, 8, 9, "My son, hear the instructions of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy moth-er; for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck." Also in Prov. iv, 1, "Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding; for I give you good doctrine : forsake not my law." Read the first four verses of Prov. vii. _ ors
