Goon 245 HEALTH OF FEMALE GYMNASTS. DR. POST, of New York, recently inves-tigated the physical condition of a number of female circus performers. Three were bare-back riders, one a trapeze performer, and one an aerial gymnast, performing with ropes and rings twenty-five feet above the floor. All were married wo-men, had borne children, and, with one exception, were enjoying excellent health. One had been injured by a fall, and was an invalid except when performing. Each of these persons had been in training for their profession from the early age of seven to ten years, and had apparently never suffered in any way from the violent exertion of their performances. In view of this fact, why is it that so many school-girls are supposed to be se-riously injured by a little exercise going up and down stairs ? Is it not possible that other causes contribute to the decline of health so common among girls, much more than overstudy or overexercise? If girls were allowed the same freedom for exercise in the open air usually given to boys of the same age, we should see far fewer cases of breaking down at sixteen to twenty, and hear far less of "spinal disease," neurasthenia, hysterics, etc. All of the women seen by Dr. Post continued their violent performances without inter-ruption on account of functions peculiar to their sex. Two of the riders who rode bare-back, standing on tiptoe, and jump-ing through hoops, making fifty leaps in six minutes, continued their usual work without interruption to within a few days of confinement, and without any apparent injury. All were accustomed to begin their performances within four to six weeks after confinement, not only without injury, but with apparent benefit. We commend these facts to those moth-ers who are educating their daughters up to a life of chronic invalidism by allowing them to fritter away their time with trashy literature and piano thrumming, carefully shielding them from all the bur-dens of life, and giving them no instruc- tion or experience in the practical arts of the household, because they are " so deli-cate." What sort of mothers will such girls make? A Magnetic ExperimentŠThe query has long been made, whether the wonder-working magnet were capable of influenc-ing a human body otherwise than through the imagination. It may not be generally known that the question was practically settled by experiment many years ago. Lord Lindsay obtained a magnet of enor-mous power, and of such shape and size that any person who wished to try the experiment could place his head between the poles. The result was most marvelous Šnothing whatever was perce,ived. If a person approaches close to a large magnet, the watch in his pocket will cease to tick; but his heart goes on beating as regularly as though the marvelous reservoir of force were nothing more than ordinary iron. In view of these facts, how much cura-tive virtue is to be attributed to the so-called " magnetic water " ? Testing the Air.ŠOne of the most useful devices exhibited at the Berlin Hygienic exposition last year was a simple instru-ment for testing the air for carbonic acid gas, invented by Dr. Wolpert. It con-sisted of a rubber ball and a test tube, the test consisting in the reaction of carbonic acid gas upon lime-water. The instru-ment is not manufactured in this country; but we have made some experiments with a somewhat similar apparatus, which we believe will give more accurate results. We will describe it in some future number. ŠSocks of lamb's wool are a much bet-ter means of keeping the feet warm at night than hot bottles or jugs so much employed. ŠThe Great Eastern Railway Co. of England supplies its employees with oat-meal-water in place of beer, and with good results,
