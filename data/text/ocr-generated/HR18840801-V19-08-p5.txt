GOO1 PI  RA 229    and physical organization. In this respect, memory does not stand alone. Like ev-ery other mental trait, the memory shares, under ordinary circumstances, the health of the frame which owns it. There is a material basis of healthy mind, apart from all considerations of a metaphysical kind, in healthy brain-structure, in pure blood, fresh air, and well-nourished nervous tis-sue. This much no one may deny. Hence, one prolific cause of some memory-ailments of very frequent occurrence, is simply bod-ily ill-health. Ordinary and slight ail-ments of body, loss of tone, weariness, fa-tigue, and especially overwork, are each and all powerful causes of memory-weak-ness. The class of subjects *ho most fre-quently exhibit memory-weakness from these causes, are undoubtedly professional men. The busy lawyer, doctor, clergy-man, teacher, or the worried merchant, are especially liable to failures of recollec-tive power from ordinary ailments of body. And among such ailments, overwork is perhaps, in its turn, the most common. The tired and jaded brain will, in time, refuse to exert itself. The effort to recol-lect becomes even painful. The pen of the journalist, in such circumstances, pauses in the endeavor to recollect appropriate words, terms, and expressions, which, at other times, and in a healthy state, literally flow from his brain. The doctor forgets the details of the cases he sees ; his patients have to remind him, greatly to his disgust, of directions and orders he formerly gave. The clergyman or lecturer fails to hit the continuity of thought necessary for fluent expression. The lawyer cannot easily piece together the details which form his " case," and so on. The memory-troubles which are most common and most troublesome are really the offspring of overwork, mental lassitude, or bodily ailments of common-place kind ; and it should be borne in mind that such memory-troubles are not the least impor-tant, because they arise from well-known causes. On the contrary, it is because they are often readily recovered from, that they are apt to be neglected ; and it is because they are apt, by frequent repetition, to grow in intensity, that they demand spe-cial notice here. Sir Henry Holland has placed on record a highly illustrative example of the effects of over-exertion on the recollective pow-ers. He descended in one day two very deep mines in the Hartz Mountains, re- maining underground for some hours in each mine. " While in the second mine," says the author, " and exhausted both from fatigue and inanition, I felt the utter impossibility of talking longer with the German inspector who accompanied me. Every German word and phrase deserted my recollection, and it was not until I had taken food and wine, and been some time at rest, that I regained them again.' Now, in this case, it is evident there was loss of memory from sheer physical ex-haustion, the case being that of a highly-cultured man. What was seen in an ex-treme degree in Sir Henry Holland occurs frequently, in a less marked degree, in the subjects of overwork and loss of nerv-ous and bodily tone at large. It is not uncommon to find examples of the same kind in the young. In school-children, over-anxious as regards their work, and especially in those preparing for examina-tions and competitions, loss of memory from combined over-exertion and inatten-tion to bodily nourishment is only too well known. The boy or girl who is so eager to learn that meal-times and play are together regarded as unwelcome oc-currences in the day's round of duties, is a subject who deserves careful, and even stern, parental treatment. These are the subjects who, crammed to repletion with knowledge, often well enough digested, and by no means gained by rote, find their memories fail them, for the simplest matters, at the examination-table ; and these are precisely the cases in which absolute rest, attention to diet and diges-tion, with perhaps the addition of a simple tonic, suffice to restore the mental powers to their wonted activity. I have frequently known cases of stu-dents, who, under circumstances similar to those above described, have " burned the midnight oil " successfully enough as regards the acquirement of knowledge, but unsuccessfully as regards their mental health. On appearing at the examina-tion-table, and on being questioned by the examiner concerning the simplest and most trivial details, they stumble, hesitate, and finally break down. In such cases the examiner's duty becomes clear, and person-ally I have frequently acted upon this rule with unvarying success ; namely, to re-quest the student to return home, to es-chew books and studies entirely for the day and night, and to return to the exam-ination-hall after twenty-four hours' com-plete rest of body and mind.
