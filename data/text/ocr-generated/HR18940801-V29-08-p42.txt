e"nnn ef5C1000,6456050EfloDet, THE LIGHTEST inn POUNDER There is one peculiar thing about the 1894 Warwick Cycles. Every one wonders why such wheels were never before produced. There are many reasons, too numerous to mention in this space. Sufficient to know that they are a wonderful mechanical triumph, wholly in the interest of riders. The road wheel, fitted with road tires, complete, weighs ONLY 25 LBS. Yet it carries the same liberal guarantee as heavier wheels. It represents the minimum of weight and maximum of strength. It is very durable and rigid, and is the most powerful wheel for road work and hill climbing. It is not a cheap wheel. Its only cheapness is its price. It is the best wheel made Š but it costs only $125. You have heard such claims before, but have you ever seen them in practical form ? " Seeing is believing." In this case " seeing is buy-ing," and buying is economy. The best way to escape the trials of a cheap wheel is never to buy one. Remember it is not a question whether you can afford to buy a WARWICK; it is whether you can afford not to buy it.

NON=ALCOHOLIC  KUMYSS AFTER careful and long-continued experiments, we have devised a method of preparing kumyss which is not only free from alcohol, but also possesses other advantages of a superior character. Ordinary kumyss contains a considerable amount of alcohol, due to the fermentation of cane sugar, which is added for the purpose of producing carbonic acid gas. The amount of alcohol depends, of course, upon the amount of sugar added and the age of the kumyss. The sugar is made to ferment by the addition of yeast. Kumyss made in this way contains yeast alcohol, and, if the alcoholic fermentation is not complete, a variable quantity of cane sugar. In addition, ordinary kumyss con-tains a variety of toxic substances, resulting from the development of the miscellaneous microbes which are usually found in milk. The improved form of kumyss which we offer is made from sterilized milk, and by processes which render it absolutely uniform in quality. The method of manufacture is such that its con-stituents are definite and constant. It is more palatable than ordinary kumyss, in consequence of the absence of foreign microbes, and is particularly suited to cases in which milk in its ordinary form disagrees with the patient, and in which so-called " biliousness " is a troublesome symptom. Cases of hypopepsia are rapidly benefited by it. It is also of great service in the treatment of gastric neurasthenia, or nervous dyspepsia. It is extensively used in some of the largest medical institutions in the country, and has received the highest commendation from those who have investigated its merits. This kumyss is put up in pint and quart bottles, and will be shipped to ally address at the following price : Š Pint Bottles, per doz., = $2.00. Sanitarium Health Food moo., CREED, E. G.
