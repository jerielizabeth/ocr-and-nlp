With all this true, what is there pleasing in the fu-ture prospects of this nation? If our hopes were built on earth, or our trust centered in earthly govern-ments, we might well despair. But we can rejoice that our hopes are on high, beyond the influence of the commotions of this revolted world. Now is the time to wean our affections from earth entirely, sever every link, and lay up our treasure in Heaven. Soon the nations will be dashed to pieces and the saints of the Most High take the kingdom, to possess it forever and ever. Amen. Fly lingering moments. "Modern Adventism Unvailed." representation was, "In the days of these kings," the kings (kingdoms) which arose when the Roman empire was " divided," Dan. ii, 41, " shall the God of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed." So, according to this new light, the setting up of God's ev-erlastjng kingdom, was the overrunning of the Roman empire by the hordes of northern barbarians ! By the side of this, Adventism is a bundle of gross absurdi-ties, is it not ! The allusion to 1866, or any other def-inite time, has no application to us. Again we read: "10. Adventism says, 'The clay and iron feet, the iron legs, the brass thighs and sides, and the silver arms and breast of the image, are literal kingdoms, but the head of gold is a spiritual head or kingdom.' This is evidently a creature of man's own device Yes, we think just so; and we would advise our friend for his own credit to keep all such imaginings to himself. This is the first time that Adventists, so far as we know, ever heard of it. A word or two should be said respecting the literary beauties of this attack on Adventism, The author uniformly spells the era of the Seleucidie with an nŠSelencidee. We never heard of such an era. He spells the word Israel with the e before the aŠIsreal. That is a people we never heard of. Chaldean he spells Chaldeon, Bible is sometimes written with a small b, sometimes with a capital. He also introduces to us a strange king, namely, Antiochust. We have heard of a king of the name of Antiochus, and though he was an inferior and contemptible king, and not brought to view at all in Dan. ii, vii, or viii, still we do not know that he was deserving of the infliction that is express-ed by adding a t to his name. Our author also speaks of an Adventist, " Mr. Ba-rak." Does he mean the Barak of Old-Testament times? We used to hear of an Adventist by the name of Berrick, which is probably the name referred to. And certainly Eld. W. appears to know about as much concerning Adventists and their teachings, as he has evinced in writing " Barak" for Berrick. We would just say to such of our readers as have seen, or may see, the third-rate effort here referred to, to just let it pass into its merited oblivion. In a communication signed " Wardlaw," in the "Earnest Christian" of June 1864, in reference to Heb. iv, 9, we read: " In the ordinary interpretation, the spirit of this allusion, and of the analogy suggested by it, is entire-ly lost. There is not a vestige of it left. But inter-preted as above, so completely is it preserved, that the language of God in Gen. ii, 1, 3, might, in the full spirit of it, be accommodated to the work of Jesus when he rose from the dead, and the consequent sanctifica- tion of the first day of the week. Thus the work of redemption was finished, and all its glorious ends se-cured. And on the first day of the week Jesus rose from the grave, and finally rested from the work he had done ;Šwherefore the ascended Lord blessed the FIRST DAY and sanctified it.' " This is preparatory to a new edition of the fourth commandment ; for as the fourth commandment is based on the facts recorded in Gen. ii, 1-3, so there must exist some such record as is here suggested, be-fore any command can be framed for the first day of the week. But. such a record as this would be open to a slight objection or two, which we will state: 1. The work of redemption was not finished by Christ's ministry tip to the time of his resurrection. If it was, wo to the hapless generations that have lived since that time. 2. All its glorious ends were not then secured, if by secured is meant brought into actual possession of the race. Nor will they be, nor the work of redemption be finished, till all the redeemed stand together on . mount Zion. 3. Christ did not rest on the first-day of the week from his work. On the contrary he continued it through the forty days of his sojourn with his disci-ples after his resurrection, and has been continuing to work for the redemption of man, as our great High Priest above, from that time to the present. 4. "Wherefore the ascended Lord" did not bless "the first day." 5. He did not sanctify it.. Now if these five "note" can be removed, or five facts in relation to past events be reversed, then the way is open for a command for Sunday-keeping. But even then it would be more satisfactory to us if it could be found where Christ had given us a command to keep it, than to have it left for men to frame down here in the nineteenth century to meet a perplexing exigency that has arisen in their theory. What Shall I Believe? What is True of Our Country. Aernouws endeavoring to take a hopeful view of the future, Preston's last Bank Note Reporter nevertheless draws the following picture of what is true of our coun-try at the present time: " All loyal men hoped and expected that we would bring this struggle to a close without depreciating our currency more than 100 per cent. "With gold at 250 to 280, the enemies of our coun-try now tauntingly say, What is your currency worth ?" What are your gold bonds worth ?" What is your country worth ?' It is true that more than ten times, and more than twenty times, 60 days, have elapsed since this war began. It is true that more than ten times, and more than twenty times 75,000, men have already been engaged in this deadly strife. It is true that hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, and hun-dreds of thousands of our fathers, brothers, and sons, have already fallen, or been maimed or crippled for life. It is true that our National, State, County, City and Town debts, caused by this war, have rolled up tens, hundreds, and thousands of millions of dollars, un-til, like the sands upon the sea shore, it is almost in-numerable. It is true that millions of children, wives, brothers, sisters and friends, are weeping for fathers, husbands, sons and dear ones, which are not. It is true that the names of those in our midst (who would roll back the car of freedom across the battle-fields of Suon is the title of a fly-sheet of two small leaves which has been sent to this Office through the kind-ness of a friend. The author was evidently ashamed of his poor attack upon Adventism, as it comes forth without any signature, or the imprint of any publish-er. We learn, however, that it was written by one "Eld. W. Wheeler." Some very false and foolish things are ascribed to Adventism, and then Adventism objected to on their account. Also eight or nine points of objection are raised to our views of the prophecies of Dan. ii, and vii, the great image and the four beasts. Of what church this Eld. Wheeler may be a member, we know not. But if his church has produced any eminent commentators upon the Scriptures, we would refer him to them in confirmation of all the principal features of our views of the above-named prophecies. In stating as the views of Adventism those views which have been advanced by the most eminent and critical expositors of both former and modern times, this Elder seems not to have discerned that, so far as human authority was concerned, he was paying Ad-ventism the highest kind of compliment. If he has a controversy with the, views of the expositors afore said, he had better settle it with them, before attempt-ing to dazzle any body as an opponent of Adventism. He makes his attacks after the usual manner of skep-tics and infidels ; that is, throwing in an isolated object-ion here and there, or what he would fain have pass for an objection. He seems to prefer, for himself, darkness rather than light, carefully concealing his own views, and giving nothing to take the place of the theory which be attacks. Now if the said Wheeler has any belief on these important. questions, if he has any views to which he is not ashamed to sign his name, or any system to maintain, let him present it, and it will be time enough then to hold it up by the side of Advent-ism, and discuss the relative merits of the two theories. We cannot close this brief allusion to this leaf, without giving the reader a specimen or two of its pro-found teaching. One of its objections to Adventism is stated as follows: "9. The Advent ten-kingdom interpretation is an uninspired and fanciful interpretation of an inspired one, and violates every principle of the symbol and in-terpretation already fully given in the Bible. How? Answer. It makes the stone destroy that which never had any existence in the image. The image was made of gold (the Chaldeon empire,) silver (Medo-Per-sian,) brass (Grecian,) iron and clay (Roman.) Now it is a fact that the Roman empire was destroyed by the Ostrogoths, Vandals, Huns, &c., when the empire embraced the gold, silver, brass, iron and clay; hence the conclusion is irresistible that neither the gold, silver, brass, iron nor clay can be broken to pieces by the stone (Christ) in 1866. Hence Adventism is a bundle of gross absurdities, contradicting not only the facts but the inspired interpretation of the Bible." This is profound. Let the reader divine the mean-ing of this sentence, if he can: "It makes the stone destroy that which never had any existence in the im-age." The prophecy declares that the stone should break in pieces the gold, silver, brass, &c., of the im-age. This little sheet says this was done by the " Os-trogoths, Vandals, Huns, &c." Then these were the stone referred to I The interpretation of this symbolic SAYS a friend, "I would be glad to know the truth, and I believe I would try to be a Christian, if I knew what course to take. I believe the Bible is the book of God, but there are so many sects of Christians, each claiming that they are right, though differing widely in teaching and practice, that I do not know what to choose." If, my friend, you will study some of the prophecies of the Bible, which I can point you to, and some of the signs given by which we are to know when the coming of Christ is near, even at the doors, you will be convinced that Adventists are right, that the com-ing of the Lord is at hand, and that the true people of God are preparing for the event, so that they may, as the Scriptures represent they will, be looking for the advent and waiting for the coming Christ, when he ap-pears. "Of course you will have it that you Adventists are right. But if I should be convinced that the coming of Christ is at hand, what then should I believe, and how should I know what course to pursue? for they are divided as well as others." It is in vain for people to call themselves Adventists and say they believe that the coming of the Lord is at hand, unless their faith and preaching produce a real reformation. They that are prepared for translation without:death at the advent, will certainly be reform-ers. It will be something besides mere theoretical faith in Christ's coming. They will have faith in this and will be waiting for the Lord, but this is not all, there will be a moral reformation and renovation with them ; in other words, they will keep more moral commandments than other people. From what we are warned of the perils and deceptions of the last days, reason itself would teach us that such would be the case. But the last warning for men before the advent ex-pressly points to the fact. Rev. xiv, 9-12. After warning us not to follow the traditions of the leading IL
