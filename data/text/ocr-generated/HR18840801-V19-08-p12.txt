To know some life is brighter for the life we daily live, To know some heart is lighter for a joy that we can give; To ease a weary footstep, some burden's weight to bear, For one who wanders sadly, oppressed by many a care, Š These are the sweetest blessings this life of ours can give; This is the great, grand secret of knowing how to live. To feel a heavenly Father's love securely round our GIVE; To know our prayers are heeded, and answered from his throne; To plead his precious promises, and find them all made sure; To live not only by our sight, but by our faith secure; To know when this life endeth, that, then, to die is gain,Š Such living, as I count it, is not to live in vain. Š T. D. Bf., in Rome Guardian. SKETCHES OF TRAVEL, NO. 16. BY MRS. B. B. KELLOGG. LAST GLIMPSES OF ROME.ŠTHE CAPITOL. HISTORICALLY a most interesting spot is the Capitoline hill, one of the seven upon which ancient Rome was founded. To modern sight-seers its attractions consist of three separate palaces, arranged around the three sides of a small square, or piazza, as it is called in Italian, which is especially noted as the spot where Romulus is said to have founded his asylum ; where the popular assemblies were wont to be held ; where the blood of the Roman citizens was first shed in civil warfare on the occasion of the suppression of the revolt of Tiberius Gracchus, B. c. 133 ; and where Brutus har-angued the people after the murder of Caesar. A flight of asphalt steps leads from the street to this piazza, at the foot of which are two handsome lions of Egyptian porphyry, and at the top two colossal statues of Castor and Pol-lux, which once adorned the theater of Pompey. At the left of the highest steps are kept a pair of wolves in a cage, in reminiscence of the story, which every child has heard, of the wolf that nourished the twins, Remus and Romulus, Rome's half-mythical founders. In the center of the square is the celebrated bronze equestrian statue of King Marcus Aure- lius, the only perfect ancient equestrian statue in existence. Beyond this statue is the palace of the senators, built upon the ruins of the Tab-ularium (repository of the state archives) of an-cient Rome, and containing a spacious senate hall, the offices of the civic administrators, and an observatory. The palace on the right is called the Conserva-tori, and contains an extensive collection of an-tiques and bronzes, and a portrait gallery of eminent Italian poets, scholars, painters, archi-tects, and sculptors. Here is the celebrated bronze " Wolf of the Capitol,' " The Thunder Stricken Nurse of Rome," with the rent in the right hind leg, which Cicero mentions, in his description of figure, as having been caused by a stroke of lightning in his own day. That mental cramming is not wholly of modern origin is apparent from the fact that we find here pre-served an ancient tombstone to a boy of eleven and one-half years, who, according to the Latin inscription, worked himself to death extempo-rizing in Greek verse, after having gained the prize over fifty-two competitors. Here is the cinerary urn of the beautiful Agrippina, mother of the infamous Caligula ; but her ashes must long ago have been scattered to the winds, for the urn was employed in the middle ages as a measure for corn. More cheerful objects are the beautiful statues of the Thorn Extractor, a boy removing a thorn from his foot ; St. Sebastian, a celebrated painting by Guido ; and the masterpieces of such other painters as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Guercino, which adorn the walls of the several rooms of the Conservatori. Just across the square from this palace is the Capitoline Museum, comprising a collection rich in admirable works, though much less extensive than that of the Vatican. Among the most noted of the statuary is the Dying Gladiator, found in the sixteenth century, and representing a Gallic warrior re-clining on his shield, while the blood pours from a wound in his breast which he has evi-dently inflicted upon himself, preferring death to captivity. Here, too, is the beautiful Faun by Praxiteles, made memorable in modern times by Hawthorne's description in his " Marble Faun." It is the figure of a youth in an atti-tude of grace, with his garment, a lion's skin, thrown over is shoulders. The Venus of the Capitol, also said to be the workmanship of Praxiteles, a most marvelous statue in which " the marble flows like a wave," and the oldest Mosiac in existence, a represen-tation of Doves on a Fountain Basin, sometimes
