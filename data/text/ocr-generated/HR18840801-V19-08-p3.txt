No Bristol wa-ter could be more soft or pleasant than what arose from perspiration. " By half-past eleven the much greater number of those living were in an out-rageous delirium, and others quite ungov-ernable, few retaining any calmness but the ranks near the windows. They now all found that water, instead of relieving their uneasiness, rather hightened it, and Air ! air 1' was the general cry. Every insult that could be devised against the guard was repeated to provoke them to fire on us, every man that could, rushing tumultuously toward the windows with eager hopes of meeting the first shot. But these failing, they whose strength and spirits were quite exhausted, laid them-selves down, and quietly expired upon their fellows; others, who had yet some strength and vigor left, made a last effort for the windows, and several succeeded by leaping and scrambling over the backs and heads of those in the first ranks, and got hold of the bars from which there was no removing them. Many to the right and left sunk with the violent pressure, and were soon suffocated ; for now a steam arose from the living and the dead, which affected us in all its circumstances, as if we were forcibly held by our heads over a bowl of strong volatile spirits of hartshorn until suffocated ; nor could the effluvia of the one be distinguished from the other. " I need not ask your commiseration when 1 tell you that in this plight, from half an hour after eleven till two in the morning, I sustained the weight of a heavy man with his knees on my back, and the pressure of his whole body on my head ; a Dutch sergeant who had taken his seat on my left shoulder; and a black soldier bearing on my right,Šall of which nothing would have enabled me to sup-port but the props and pressure equally sustaining me all round. The two latter I frequently dislodged by shifting my hold on the bars, and driving my knuckles into their ribs ; but my friend above stuck fast, and, as,he held by two bars, was immov-able. The repeated trials I made to dis-lodge this insufferable encumbrance upon me, at last quite exhausted me, and to-ward two o'clock, finding I must quit the window or sink where I was, I re-solved on the former, having borne truly,  for the sake of others, infinitely more for life than the best of it is worth. " I was at this time sensible of no pain and little uneasiness. I found a stupor coming on apace, and laid myself down by that gallant old man, the reverend Jer-vas Bellamy, who lay dead with his son, the lieutenant, hand in hand, near the southernmost wall of the prison. Of what passed in the interval, to the time of resur-rection from this hole of horrors, I can give you no account." At six in the morning the door was opened, when only three-and-twenty out of the hundred and forty-six still breathed. These were subsequently revived. "IS CONSUMPTION CATCHING?" A WRITER in ilealth, offers some interest-ing facts respecting this very important question. We quote as follows:Š " There has long existed a belief in the popular mindŠfounded, no doubt, on that untrained experience which is in itself a powerful teacher of factsŠthat consump-tion is catching.' People have long pos-sessed the idea that it is not a good or wise practice to permit the consumptive and the healthy to sleep together ; and, as we shall see, there is apparently every justification for this idea. If the bacilli are the causes of consumptive disease; and if, as experiment proves, they are coughed up from the lungs of patients, and pass out in the breath, it is by no means a far-fetched supposition that they may be in-haled by persons whose 'predisposition' (or bodily tendency) or health is such as to adapt them to become infected. If, as we thoroughly believe, consumption is in-fectious in this sense, the bacilli, or mi-croscopic living particles, passing from sick lungs to other lungs, susceptible in one way or another to their influence, constitute the means of infection. " But very recently there has been laid before the medical profession an in-teresting series of observations connected with the communicability of consumption. The Collective Investigation Record' of the British, Medical Association has sup-plied us with a variety of cases illustrat-ing this latter tendency. Leaving out doubtful cases, and those in which no ev-idence tending, one way or the other, for the infectious nature of the disease has been noted, there remains a list of cases, recorded by medical men, in which the
