A l'IECE of very imperfect poetry, under this title, has been going the rounds of the papers, and has a number of times been sent to this Office for publication. It purports to have been written in 1041, and to be a prophecy of some remarkable event to transpire between that time and the end. Some passages would seem to refer quite distinctly to the wonders of steam and electricity and the discovery of gold. But the last two lines fix the time and name the year for the Lord to come ; and that spoils it all; for we have no confidence in any such assertion. We once published all but the last two lines of this prophecy. We did not insert them because some would perhaps fix upon the time, and above all, the impression would very likely obtain that we were time-setters ; an i'rnpression which we shall be very careful to give no one any occasion to entertain. u. s. Camp·Jieeting. ALTHO"C'GH the lateness of the hour will not mit any extended notice of the meeting at this time, I cannot forbear saying a few words. Having contracted the ague in Indiana, I came to the meeting afflicted in body, as well as greatly depressed in mind. Sixth day, the 7th inst., I was Yery sick all t.he day long, and it was with difficulty that I was up and on the ground at any time during the first five days of the meeting. For seYeral months past I had been passing through severe trials of tnind; in self-examination I had not been idle, and I became exceedingly dissatisfied with my religious experience, and my standing before God. In humbling myself, and in my confessions of my short-comings befe>re the Lord I was permitted to !:lee my weakness, my lukewarmness, and my danger. But the Lord did not leave me thus. He gave me the evidences of his loving kindness, and of the greatness of his grace, in his willingness to reach down the strong arms of his love to take us up in our lost tion and elevate us to be partakers of his divine nature and of his joy. On 'Vednesday, the 12th, having retired to the grove to have a visit with Bro. White, after some conversation in regard to my feelings and to my condition, as Bro. White raised his voice in prayer the glory of the Lord shone round about us, and our hearts were filled with sacred joy. Together we wept, and while sweet peace filled my mind, new life seemed to be imparted to my feeble frame, and all traces of disease were driven away. Since that time, I have had richer views of the love of God than ever before, and my bodily health has not been so good in many years. In my feeble and desponding state it seemed as if I could not possibly labor in public much longer. I thought the period of my efficiency was about closed, and that other and younger laborers must occupy my place. But I now believe it is God's will that, as the message rises in strength and power, his servants should rise with it. Work, which seemed so difficult, now seems a pleasure. My hope is stronger than it has been at any time before for years, and my heart beats in perfect union with God's faithful servants who have so long, and under so many discouragements, "borne the heat and burden of the day." The cause and work of the third anael's messaae is of God; his Spirit is in it, and it ;ust succeed. It is rising, and we will praise him for his ence with us, while we strive to do his will. May the Lord help us all to realize the ness of the work before us, to warn the world of impending destruction, and to prepare to stand in that terrible yet joyful day when his Son shall be revealed from Heaven. J. H. wAGGONER. Tbe Hygienic Cook Book. EvERY family should have one. It will be a great help to those who wish to adopt the most healthful diet. And who does not I It is more than folly to choose to live upon a diet that is constantly undermining health and preparing the system to suddenly fall under the power of ease. It is better to deny perverted appetite, and learn to relish the most healthful food. While folly follows the fashion, wisdom finds a better way. The Cook Book 
recommends the most healthy food, and gives instructions how to prepare it. It should not be necessary to advise people to "choose the beat," yet they are slow to make such a choice. And for the benefit of those who are beginners in the health reform, and should make a gradual change, the" progrt;ssive" department is added, embracing some articles of food that are not strictly hygienic-not the be11t. It is not tended that they should always remain in this de· partment ; but that they should progress till they attain to the best. Yet many who have been posed to be staunch reformers for years show a decided preference still for this part of the book. They pass by that which has the first place as the very best, and mark their progress as we used to in the spelling book of olden time, by getting over "beyond the pictures." If this is a mark of ress, would it not be better in the future editions of the book to put the progressive department in the forepart of the book ? Ł Those who would adopt the reform should have the book. If you would abandon unhealthy ticles of food, and, at the same time, not suffer for the want of something to supply their place, get the book, and learn to provide a great variety of the most delicious, as well as most healthful, food. R. F. CoTTRELL. Special Notice. THOSE coming to the New England ing who come over the Worcester and Nashua R. R. must purchase Camp-meeting tickets at W cester and Nashua, as no return tickets will be given to those places. But return tickets will be given to other points on the road.

Clinton is about a mile from the camp-ground. ments will be made to convey those passengers who are unable to walk that distance from ton to the camp-ground. S. N. HASKELL. Notice.

To the Chut·cbes in Ohio. As our Conference will hold its next annual meeting in connection with the camp-meeting, it is necessary that the clerk of each church furnish the secretary with a financial and church report. The treasurers should also send in their s. B. quarterly reports. Quite a number have not been heard from this year. Let the reports be sent in two weeks before the meetings. Address A. A.

The New England CantpŁMeeting. THIS meeting will be held according to the pointment, Aug. 27-31. It will be upon the old ground near South Lancaster village. The cars on Thursday and Friday, except the evening train, are expected to stop at the ground. Those ing over the Boston, Clinton, and Fitchburg road will stop at Clinton which is about a mile and a half from the camp-ground. Considering the success that has thus far attended the western camp-meetings this year, the important advance steps that are being taken in this work, which will be considered at this meeting, and the ence of Bro. and sister White, we look for the most important meeting ever held in New England, and we expect a larger attendance than at any previous camp-meeting in this Conference. pecially do we invite all scattered members, who have not the privilege of weekly meetings with those of like precious faith, to attend this ing. We have reached an important crisis in this work. There are many who are embracing the Sabbath by the efforts of the Tract Society. All such should be encouraged to attend the meeting. Unconverted children of Sabbath-keepers, your friends and neighbors who are favorably impressed with the truth, should be encouraged to attend. Then let the church come prepared to labor for their salvation. Those wishing tents should order immediately, stating what size, and whether they wish to buy or to rent. Order of H. B.

Let the church officers of each church see that their reports are sent at once to the secretary, !M. Wood, Corner of K and Emerson Streets, South Boston, Mass. Also let each s. B. treasurer see that the s. B. pledges are paid in each church as far as convenient, so that the money may be paid in to the Conference treasurer on, or before, the time of the camp-meeting. s. N.

J. B. GOODRICH, Pres. N. Y. Confet·ence. THE N. Y. and Pa. Conference will hold its next anual session in connection with the meeting at Kirkville, N. Y., Sept. 10-14, 1874. Systematic Benevolence should be re-arranged and delegates appointed for the Conference in season so that they may all be on the ground the first day of the meeting. There should be a special effort made to have each church in the Conference represented either by delegate or letter, as the Conference records will probably be revised and churches standing on the records and failing to report at this meeting may be dropped. We hope to see a general tendance at this meeting in accordance with the suggestions of Bro. Butler. Let not home cares unnecessarily detain any. Make a sacrifice, if need be, to be present, and then expect to meet the Lord there. B. L. WHITNEY, (J(mj. p. z. KINNE, lN. Y. 8. N. WALSWORTH, Com. The annual meeting of theN. Y. and Pa. T. & M.
