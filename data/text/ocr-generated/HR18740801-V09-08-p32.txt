256 THE HEALTH REFORMER. aittmo f the  !.~»  cnth. Tracts! Tracts! Tracts! THE long promised tracts are now ready ; or, at least, a few are prepared for circulation. The subjects treated are such as the people are in the greatest need of being enlightened upon. They have been prepared especially for general circula-tion, and are, accordingly, written in a manner adapted to the popular mind. All of them are short and concise, and the effort has been to make them attractive and interesting by avoiding pro-lixity of language and unnecessary refinements of argument. The writers have endeavored to con-dense as much matter as practicable into the least possible space, and to so arrange and divide the subjects treated as to keep constantly before the mind of the reader new and attractive subjects of interest. The prices have been placed low, as an inducement to the friends of the cause of health reform to give the tracts a liberal distribution. We hope our friends will send for specimen copies and read them with careful scrutiny ; then if they find them adapted to the wants of their ignorant neigh-bors and friends, we shall be heartily glad to have them sown broadcast over the land, and will sup-ply them by the hundred at the liberal discount of forty per cent. We give below brief descriptions of each of the several tracts. Circulate the truth, friends. Let us not selfishly hide our light ; but let us work for the general good of humanity. Startling Facts about Tobacco. Ix this tract are presented thirty unanswerable objections to the filthy habit of tobacco-using, the main scope of which is indicated in the motto of the tract, " Tobacco ruins a man physically, men-tally, and morally ; it is a social nuisance and a national curse." Price 5 cts. Twenty-five Arguments for Tobacco- Using Briefly Answered. Tnis is a thorough exposure of the fallacious reasoning and unfounded assertions by means of which the users of the filthy weed attempt to apologize for the disgusting habit. We think it will be found a useful tract to hand to those whose minds have been called to the subject by reading the preceding tract or some similar publication. Price, 3 cts. Tea and Coffee. THIS is a tract of 32 pp., in which the subject of the use of tea and coffee is considered in each of its several bearings.

Price, 3 cts. Dyspepsia. IN this tract the subject of dyspepsia is briefly considered under the three general heads, Causes, How to Prevent, and How to Cure. The causes of the disease are quite fully discussed, as well as the means of prevention, so that the work might be made of the most practical benefit to its readers. Brief descriptions of the various baths which can be made available for home treatment are also added. We can safely guarantee that almost any person suffering from this dreadful disease can readily find the road to health by a careful perusal of this little work. Price 5 cts. Other Important Tracts. IN addition to the above-mentioned tracts, which are now fresh from the press, we offer a very excellent little tract entitled, " Dress Re-form," which is just suited to the purpose of dis-tribution by those who wear the reform dress. All such persons should keep constantly on hand a supply of these tracts to hand to those who may inquire their reasons for wearing the dress. A tract, entitled, " Principles of Health Re-form," or " What Health Reform Is and What it Is Not," will soon be ready. Trall's Encyclopedia. IN answer to quite a number of inquiries re-specting this long-promised work, we would say that we can give no information whatever. At the latest accounts, the book was not yet written, and no arrangements had been made for publish-ing it. For the sake of the scores who have al-ready paid for the work, we sincerely hope it may soon appear. THE. H KALTH REFORMER. BATTLE CEBBIL. MICHIGAN.
