Vol,. 30. BATTLE CREEK, MICH., AUGUST 2, 1882. No. 31. SONG OF THE SUMMER WINDS. P the dale and down the bourne, O'er the meadow swift we Hy; Now we sing, and now we mourn, Now we whistle, now we sigh. By the grassy fringed river, Through the murmuring reeds we sweep; Mid the lily-leaves we quiver, To their very hearts we creep. Through the blooming groves we rustle, Kissing every bud we pass,Š As we did it in the bustle, Scarcely knowing how it was. Down the glen, across the mountain, O'er the yellow heath we roam, Whirling round about the fountain, Till its little breakers foam. Bending down the weeping willows, While our vesper hymn we sigh; Then unto our rosy pillows On our weary wings we hie. ŠGeorge Darley. PUBLIC PARKS. plAN seems to possess an inbred desire to enjoy the delights and beauties of nature. Al-though often deprived of such enjoyment by being obliged to labor in the cities where the artificial often crowds out the natural, yet we see his longings and desires manifested in frequent ex-cursions to quiet, retired places in the country, where, uninterrupted by the busy cares of city life, he may rest, and recover health and strength in viewing the natural beauties around him. It is, undoubtedly, for the purpose of satisfying this demand, as far as possible, that the large cities have established parks, where the rich and poor may resort to enjoy themselves. Thus New York has its Central Park, covering an area two and one-half miles long and one-half mile wide. This is per-haps the most interesting to the public of all the parks in the United States, and is visited at times by at least 100,000 persons in a single day. Philadelphia has its Fairmount Park, which covers a still larger area than Central Park ; Boston boasts of its Common ; Brooklyn inhabitants recreate at Prospect Hill, and Baltimore, St. Louis, and other cities all have their parks, which they make as beautiful as possible for the enjoyment of the peo-ple. Our illustration gives a very fine representation of one of the entrances to Lincoln Park, to which Chicago points with especial pride as being the largest and most beautiful park in the city. The  fountain in front was placed there by the Illinois Humane Society, a society that was established for the prevention of cruelty to animals. The park borders on Lake Michigan, where, in the distance, may be seen a peculiarly shaped house surmounted with a tower. This is called the "crib." What is that house placed there for? some of our young readers may ask. Well, the "crib" is at the end of a tunnel three miles in length, which has been dug from the land, under the bottom of the lake. At the "crib" a large fine sieve covers the opening of the tunnel, through which the pure, fresh water from the lake flows in, and is conducted by the tunnel to the water works, situated on the shore of the lake. The water works contain four large and very pow-erful steam pumps, which force the water through iron pipes laid in the streets, to all parts of the city. It is in this way that the fountain in our Ł engraving is supplied with water. Chicago's, system of parks embraces an area of  over 2,000 acres, divided between six or seven parks, all of which are connected by broad park-ways, or boulevards, as they are called, so that a person can drive all around the city following these boulevards, and pass through the principal parks, such as Humboldt, Central, South, and Lincoln Parks. These are the largest and most beautiful parks in the city, and they are visited during the summer by thousands of people, especially on Sun-days. South Park is approached from the north by a wide, wood-paved boulevard, in the middle of which extends a winding gravel walk, ornamented with smooth lawns, beautiful flower beds, and fine shade trees. Lincoln Park is situated in the northern part of the city, on the shore of Lake Michigan. With its well-kept lawns, large, noble shade trees, miles of drives mad walks, beautiful flower beds and con-servatories, and the cool, refreshing breezes from the lake, it is not astonishing that it is so well pat-
