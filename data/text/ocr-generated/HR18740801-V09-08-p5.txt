THE HEALTH REFORMER. 229 we consider to be the true temperance platform, and by so doing to indicate our conviction that the present movement could not be considered as anything more than a palliative of the evil. We believe that intemperance is a VICE, and that the root of the evil is to be found in the desire for artificial stimulation, just as stealing is a vice founded in selfishness and covetousness. We also firmly believe in laws against stealing and all other crimes, but have no confidence that thieves and criminals will ever be exterminated by the enactment of even the most strenuous laws and their rigid enforcement. So long as men lack the principle of godliness in their hearts, so long as they are selfish and dishonest, just so long will they continue to commit the crimes which evil motives and desires may prompt, in spite of laws. Just so it is with intemperance. We are heart-ily in favor of the most uncompromising legisla-tion, making the traffic in liquor wholly unlaw-ful. Nothing can be plainer than that no man has any right to deal out to his fellow-men that which he knows is leading them down to death. Alcohol is a deadly poison ; and who can say that a government is morally justified in granting to men the privilege of deliberately murdering their friends and neighbors with the intoxicating cup, to say nothing of the scores of other evils even worse than death itself, which alcohol occasions ? But just so long as there is a demand for liq-uor, there will be a supply, notwithstanding all prohibitory laws. Just so long as men retain the appetite for intoxicating, drinks, they will find some means for gratifying it, so that intemper-ance will be perpetuated. We are firm advocates of the no-license doc-trine with reference to liquor; but we cannot stop here. Apply the same arguments to that great social nuisance and abomination, tobacco. It is a poison even more deadly than alcohol. It keeps a man in a state of constant intoxication. It is not of the slightest benefit to any human being ; and we are prepared to show that it is not only vastly more productive of disease than is alcohol, but that it is one of the chief causes of intemperance. Then why not oppose it equally as strongly as we do alcohol? There can be no good reason. Its effects are not so apparent at first as are those of alcohol, but they are more deeply implanted in the system. But, says one, how shall this great problem be solved ? how may intemperance be routed, and with it all the evils which grow out of it? We answer, In just the same manner that other vices  are to be eradicated. Make Christians of all the thieves, and stealing will cease. Make hygienists of all the men, women, and children, in America, and the dram shops will close from lack of cus-tomers, the distilleries will cease to waste the precious grains for want of patronage. Instruct the people in healthful ways of living. Show them the relation between diet and intemperance. Impress upon them the truth that more than half the drunkards in the land are made such at the dinner table and around the domestic hearth. Show to them that rich pastry, highly-seasoned viands, stimulating drinksŠlike tea and coffeeŠand irritating condimentsŠsuch as pepper, mus-tard, spice, etc., together with the wine sauces and the brandy picklesŠare the seeds of drunk-enness which germinate in childhood, and in youth develop the full-grown tree of intem-perance. Hygiene is the mortal enemy of intemperance. As its principles gain acceptance, and as its pre-cepts are practiced, the great scourge of society will cease its ravages. Health reform is the only physical salvation for the race. "A Pill for the Vegetarians." UNDER the above heading, the following par-agraph has been circulating quite widely among the newspapers and anti-vegetarian journals of the day :Š " In a French industrial establishment, em-ploying six hundred and thirty men, chiefly vegetarians, the sick fund was constantly in debt. The director of the establishment took measures for the introduction of butcher's meat into the food of the men, and the effect was such that the average loss of time per man, on account of illness and fatigue, was reduced from fifteen to three days per annum. Thus the an-imal food saved twelve days' work a year per man." One of our subscribers writes us that having received the REFORMER through the kindness of a friend, during the past few months, he has been induced by its teachings to reduce his meat bill to less than one-fourth its original amount, and that he is, like one of old, " almost per-suaded ; " but, seeing the above and similar items, his growing faith is somewhat shaken. He wishes our opinion on the subject; and for his benefit and that of others who may be in a like situation, we will examine this wonderful " Pill." It is said that the six hundred and thirty men employed in the establishment referred
