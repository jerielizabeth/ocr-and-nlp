252 A DOCTOR'S CHATS. . How TO PREPARE MALTED MILK.Š The discovery was made a few years since that the extract of malt contains, in addition to the well-known starch-di-gesting ferment which converts starch into maltose, a ferment capable of digesting albuminoid substan-ces. The following is the method of preparation : To a pint of milk add one tablespoonful of malt. The milk may be heated to a temperature of 6o°, being boiled for twenty or thirty minutes. This fer-ment, known as peptose, acts upon albuminoids very slowly at ordinary or lower temperatures. It is analogous to the ferment found in pineapple juice. It is destroyed at 175° F. After that, it should be brought to a boiling point. This will check the further action of the malt. Milk thus treated does not form large hard curds in the stomach, and agrees perfectly with many persons who cannot digest milk  in its hard form. This method of peptonizing milk is much preferable to the old method, in which various preparations of pancreatin are employed. These animal substances not infrequently gave to milk a very unpleasant flavor and odor, and some-times imparted to it poisonous substances. CHEWING LIQUID FOODS.ŠTHE idea of drinking milk is unhygienic; milk should be eaten. It should be taken as food, and it needs to be carefully chewed. A calf always chews his milk. It is necessary that milk, as well as all other food, should be carefully chewed in order to be digested. It is just as neces-sary to mix saliva with milk, as with bread, in order to digest it. The idea that milk is a liquid, an hence it cannot be chewed is a mistaken one. Take small."' sips, with a little cracker or toast, and then chew it. I ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. THE "CALIFORNIA COLD PROCESS" OF FRUIT CANNING.Š Mrs. J. C. W. asks for information. in regard to the above process, whether it is reliable, and also whether the " Extract of Salyx," sold by a certain company at the rate of $1 for a two-ounce pack-age, is harmless. Ans.Š We are acquainted with no "cold process " for pre-serving food which does not depend upon some antiseptic sub-stance. All so-called antiseptics, including salicylic acid, which is probably the basis of the so-called "Extract of Salyx," are more or less poisonous and injurious. EGGSŠ ALABASTINE.Š S. U. B. asks the following questions : 6,  i. Which class of eggs contains the most nutrition, those having yolks of a rich yellow color, or those having yolks of a light cream color ? 2. When plastering is cracked, will alabastine fill up and cover the cracks ?" Ans.Ši. We arc not aware of any analyses relating to this question. Probably there is no practical difference between the two kinds of eggs described. 2. Cracks in plastering should, be filled with plaster of paris before the application of alabastine or any other form of plastering. PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.ŠJ. A. L. writes : " My wife suffers acutely at time of menstruation ; is there anything you can rec-commend that would tide her over this time with less pain ?" Ans.ŠRest in bed and a hot hip-pack taken at the time will often relieve menstrual pain. But the patient should place her-self under the care of a skillful physician, as the pain is only a symptom, and doubtless indicates a diseased condition which re-quires close attention and skillful treatment. CURE FOR TOBACCO USING.Š J. H. S. writes as follows : " In GOOD HEALTH the assertion is made that you ' have found no difficulty in relieving the worst tobacco users of the habit in two weeks, where there was a genuine de-sire to reform.' I have that genuine desire' ; and would be glad to have you outline the treatment best for me. I have chewed tobacco immoderately for eighteen years." Ans. ŠIt will be necessary for the patient to visit the Sani-tarium and place himself under treatment. We have no panacea which we can recommend for use at home. PEROXIDE OF HYDROGEN.Š F. E. H. asks : " Do you recom-mend the use of peroxide of hydrogen for bronchitis, nasal catarrh, or catarrh of the stomach ? " Ans.Š We have no experience in the use of this remedy in treating bronchitis or catarrh of the nose or stomach. There are other remedies in which we should have greater confidence. WATER RISING IN THE MOUTH Š AMOUNT OF FOOD, ETC.ŠS. A. B. wishes to know : "1. What is the cause of nausea, and water rising in the mouth a few hours after a meal ? 2. What is then the condition of the stomach ? 3. What is the proper quantity of food per day, in weight, for persons engaged in office work ? 4. Is corn as nutritious and easily digested as wheat, oats, etc.? 5. Are roasting ears' ; or green corn cut and stewed, safe food for catarrhal subjects, or those afflicted with bad livers? " Ans.ŠI. Indigestion. 2. There is a failure of the stomach to absorb its fluid contents. 3. Twenty to twenty-one ounces of water-free food. 4. Practically, yes. 5. Yes. SORENESS OF THE STOMACH Š TENDERNESS OF THE FLESH, ETC.ŠM. H. is troubled with a soreness of the stomach, and the entire flesh is tender to the touch. A part of the time the spine and kidneys are sore. He has worn an abdominal bandage, and it gives strength of body and also of will power. When he takes it off, he seems helpless in mind and body. He asks : " Is it right to wear this bandage constantly ? If not, what would you advise ? " Ans.ŠThe bandage can be worn a long time without injury, provided pains are taken to keep the skin in a healthy state. A good plan is to wear a moist bandage during the night, and a dry bandage during the day. The skin should be kept thoroughly clean by daily washing with soap and water. Bathing the skin with alcohol is also a good means of keeping it healthy.
