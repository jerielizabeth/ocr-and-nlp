60 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. Zht licintWo fuotrator. BATTLE CREPE, NIOR,, AUGUST, 1872. Miss J. R. TREMBLEY Ł Ł EDITOR. Be ye Pure. THERE has heretofore been but little said through the INSTRUCTOR on the subject of health reform. We think it has not been, however, for lack of interest in this impor-tant movement. The following is part of an article written by sister Nellie F. Heald, and read before the New England Tract Society. Thinking our young readers may enjoy its perusal, and with the hope that each one will try to profit by it, we give it here. A reform in regard to the laws of health, which is called the basis of all reforms, seems especially important in a people who are engaged in a still nobler reform in re-ligious faith and practice. We who are looking for that blessed hopeŠthe appear-ing of our Saviour in the clouds of heaven, need to lay aside every weight. And is not indulgence of appetite and perverted taste a hindrance to our growth in graceŠa weight upon the wings of faith and love ? Can we rightly prepare for that solemn and thrilling event while we daily eat of that which is adding impurity and disease to the body, thus dimming the mental pow-ers and lowering the spiritual life ? Jesus demands a pure and spotless church to meet his second coming. And has not the health reform, so chaste and elevating in its tendency, come, e'en from the verge of Heaven, to assist his dear children to meet this demand ? This we firmly believe; and its blessings are for all who are willing to comply with its pure and self-denying precepts. We need its aid, as we struggle on toward Heaven 'gainst wind, and storm, and tide. We need it, that we may run with patience the race that is set before us. Let us thank God for the light of health reform, and strive to walk in the light, that we may finally receive the reward of the overcomer. " To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God." Joy. IN this short word we have expressed all the delight and good cheer that a happy soul can feel. But joy is of two kinds : low and vile, or high and noble, true or false. That joy is vile and low which exults over the misery or pain of any animal or insect, or that glories over the downfall or misfortune of a fellow-being. What little boy is it that delights in killing birds and robbing their nests, or in teasing his playmates ? Let me here tell him that such joy is false and will surely bring him sorrow and remorse. That joy is high and noble which springs from a pure heart and rejoices in the happi-ness of every being. Have you enemies that do you 'harm? True joy will rejoice at the privilege of doing them good in return. It lights up the countenance of its possessor in the darkest hour. He can look with delight to the future home of the saints, if he be a  Christian, and exult over the prospect of the joy that will be his in the heavenly world. He that possesses this influence in its true form has a treasure that is of more value than gold and silver. He not only has that which, in a great measure, gives health to the body and peace to the soul in this life, but that also which gives a bright hope and a sure prospect of the joy that will be expe-rienced by all in the kingdom of glory. I. D. VAN HoRN. The Aelions a True Index of the Heart. THE feelings and intents of our hearts are generally manifest in our words and actions. This is very good when our motives spring from a desire to be gentle and kind to others. But we often feel in ourselves, and some-times see in others, a desire to appear in some way better than we are, in order to gain the approbation of our associates and society generally. Some in their dress seek for approbation, but gain the esteem of a few equally as silly as themselves ; while from the vulgar they receive ridicule, and from the thinking class, pity or contempt. Others, by their wit, seek to excite the laughter of the simple and vain. These do not bear in mind that for every idle word they must render an account in the day of Judgment. Again, there are those who think the little things of life are of minor importance, and for want of thoroughness in the first princi-ples of common studies, fail to obtain an ed-ucation that might be of benefit to others, and a blessing to themselves. We see many of this class aspiring to things too high for them without any real object save to gain applause. Such persons are satisfied with a surface work in the common branches, and it is feared they will derive no real benefit from the study of higher ones, for the intent of their hearts seems to be for applause, and if they fail to obtain itŠand they are very liable toŠthey become discouraged, and yield up to indolence and sloth. If we would judge ourselves when about to seek approbation by word or deed, we would not be often found engaged in doing that which would prove hurtful to our morals or relig-ion. We do not approve such actions in others, why then, should we expect their favor and approval for the silly words we may utter ? for the vain show in the dress we put on ? or for the high, but false, pretension we make of our education and attainments? The Bible says, "A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may dis-cover itself." Prov. 18 : 2. Surely, if the in-tents of our hearts are for show, instead of a deep, settled principle to learn what we do learn well, and to do what we do faithfully and thoroughly, we will discover our hearts to others, whether we are blind to our foolish course or not. C. GREEN. Battle Creek. A LITTLE HERO.ŠA little boy seven years of age had his leg broken, and was carried home on a litter. His poor mother, who had been long ill and confined to bed, was much shocked when she heard of it. She attemped to rise, but fainted, and was obliged to re-turn to bed. The injury done to her poor little boy's leg was very severe, and he suffered a great deal of pain while it was being set, and while the bruises were dressed. But, during the whole operation, the child did not utter even one cry of pain. Every one present was sur-prised at his fortitude, and he was asked if he had not suffered much. " Oh ! very much," said he, gently, " but I was so afraid of giving pain to mamma that I tried to keep from crying." This boy afterward became one of the he-roes of the Crimea. My Shepherd. CHILDREN, did you ever read that beauti-ful psalm, commencing, " The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want"? Ps. 2 3 : 1. If not, please turn and read it, and it would be well for you to commit it to memory. King David, the writer of this beautiful language, in his youthful days had been a shepherd. Oft-times had he led his father's flock to the green pastures, and beside the sparkling waters. He knew what it was to have the care of sheep ; and to feel a deep interest in the wel-fare of the flock. Many times had he pro-tected them from danger, driving away wild beasts, and constantly watching over them for good. He was called from the humble occupation of caring for his father's sheep, to the throne, to be a king, and a shepherd over Israel. In this position, he feels that he is but a wandering sheep himself, and bad great need of a shepherd. How happy was David when he could feel that the Lord was his shepherd, and was constantly lead-ing hitn in paths of righteousness. Children, have you such a shepherd as this ? You may have, and, what is more, you must have, or finally be lost. Jesus is the Good Shepherd, kindly caring for the flock. He beareth the lambs in his bosom, and will in nowise cast out any that come unto him. He says, " I am the good shep-herd . . . My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life." Again, he says, " Suffer little children to come unto me." Now you may come, heed the voice of the Good Shepherd, and follow him. Then you can say at all times as did king David, " The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not *ant." Very soon the Good Shepherd will gather the sheep and lambs to the heavenly fold. Now is the time to hear and obey the sweet voice of Jesus. Now is the time to seek a place in the fold of Christ. And if you are numbered with this little flock, it will soon be the Father's good pleasure to give you an eternal home in the kingdom. Then you may follow the shepherd whithersoever he goeth. Now pause, and think. Can you say, The Lord is my shepherd? H. A. ST. JOHN. A Letter to the Children. DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS : I have many times thought of writing to you, but it seems to me to be so difficult to know just how to write to children, much more so than to talk to them. As I write, I thinkof a bright, sunny face by the sea, others over the hills, and some away out on the prairie, who know the writer, and I would be glad to say some-thing to interest and instruct them if I could. It may be an old story to tell you Jesus is coming to take good people to the beautiful home which is being prepared for them. But we want to hear stories we love often re-peated. It is so pleasant to think of that time, for everything that makes us unhappy now can never occur after Jesus comes. Can you not remember when the sweet baby face of your little brother or sister lay white and motionless before you, and some kind friend told you it was dead ? Perhaps you have others, but death still reigns. When Jesus comes, no children or grown people can die in that beautiful land, and more than this, those innocent little ones and all good people who have died will be made alive
