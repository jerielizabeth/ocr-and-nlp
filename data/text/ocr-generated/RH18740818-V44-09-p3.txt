Aug. 18, 1874. 'they all escaped safe to land,: means en." The preacher dwelt with becoming fervency on the importance of casting out the anchors-faith, hope, love, and prayer, the necessity of abiding in the ship in der to be saved, and the consolation to be found in the fact that not a hair of their heads should be hurt, but that they (the members of the church) should all reach the shore in safety. The preacher cluded by asking one of our aged preachers, whom he had invited into the pulpit out of respect· to his gra.y hairs, to close the meeting with a few remaTks. The old brother arose, and, placing his hand on the young theologians head, as if giving him a phrenological examination, proceeded in his plain, uneducated style, substantially as follows:-" My young brother, you've preached us a mighty pretty discourse to-day, but I'm afeard you've made some awful mistakes. You said that the ship meant the church. If that's so, we haven't got no church now, for the ship was all smashed to pieces and destroyed. You also said that the four chors were faith, hope, love, and prayer. If that's so, we han't got anyfaith, hope, love, and prayer, in the church, as they have been cast out. And you said that Christians arc the crew. If that's so, they are a mighty blood-thirsty set, for they wanted to kill Paul. You told us that the island of Melita meant Heaven. \Vell, if ;.hat's true,'Heaven must be a mighty snaky as one bit Paul as soon as he landed." It is stated as a historical fact that the young preacher was never known to preach that " pretty" discourse again in all that region of country. The Tt'mptation of Christ. BY MRS E. G. WHITE. (Continued.) JEsus did not condescend to explain to his enemy how he was the Son of God, and in what manner, as such, he was to act. In an insulting, taunting manner Satan ferred to the present weakness and the unfavorable appearance of Cluist in trast with his own strength and glory. He taunted Ch1·ist that he was a poor sentative of the angels, much more of their exalted Commander, the acknowledged King in the royal courts. His present pearance indicated that he was forsaken of God and man. He said if Christ was deed the Son of God, the monarch of Heaven, he had power equal with God, and he could give him evidence by ing a miracle, and changing the stone just at his feet into bread, and relieve his ger. Satan promised that, if Christ would do this, he would at once yield his claims of superiority, and that the contest tween himself and Christ should there be forever ended. Christ did not appear to notice the ing taunts of Satan. He was not provoked to give him proofs of his power. He ly bore his insults without retaliation. The words spoken from Heaven at his baptism were very precious, evidencing to him that his Father approved the steps he was ing in the plan of salvation as man's stitute and surety. The opening heavens, and descent of the heavenly dove, were surances that his Father would unite his power in Heaven with that of his Son upon the earth, to rescue man from the control of Satan, and that God accepted the effort of Christ to link earth to Heaven, and nite man to the infinite. These tokens, received from his Father, were inexpressibly precious to the Son of God through all his severe sufferings, and terrible conflict with the rebel chief. And' while enduring the test of God in the derness, and through his entire ministry, he had nothing to do in convincing Satan of his own power, and of his being the Saviour of the world. Satan had sufficient evidence of his exalted station. His willingness to ascribe to Jesus the honor due to him, and manifest submission as a Fmbordim.te, ripened into rebellion against God, and shut him out of Heaven. It was not any part of the mission of Christ to exercise his divine power for his own benefit,toi·elievc himselffromsutfering This he had volunteered to take upon self. He had condescended to take man's nature, and he was to suffer the iences, and ills, and afflictions, of the man family. He was not to perform acles on his own account. He came to save othe1-s. The object of his mission was to bring blessings, and hope, and life, to the afflicted and oppressed. He was to bear the burdens and grief.s of suffering ity. Although Christ was suffering the est pangs of hunger, he withstood the temptations. He repulsed Satan with Scripture, the same he had given Moses in the wilderness to repeat to rebellious Israel when their diet was restricted, and they were clam01·ing for flesh-meats, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'' In this declaration, and also by his ple, Christ would show man that hunger for temporal food was not the greatest lamity that could befall him. Satan tered our first parents that eating of the fruit of the tree of life of which God bad forbidden them would bring to them great good, and would insure them against death, the very opposite of the truth which God had declared to them. "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou ·shalt surely die." If Adam had been obedient, he would never have known want, sorrow, nor death. If the people who lived before the flood had been obedient to the word of God, they would have been preserved, and would not have perished by the waters of the flood. If the Israelites had been obedient to the words of God, he would have bestowed on them special blessings. But they fell in consequence of the indulgence of tite and passion. They would not be dient to the words of God. Indulgence of perverted appetite led them into numerous and grievous sins. If they had made the requirements of God their first tion, and their physical wants secondary, in submission to God's choice of propel' food for them, not one of them would have fallen in the wilderness. They would have been established in the goodly land of naan a holy, healthy people, with not a feeble one in all their tribes. The Saviour of the world became sin for the race. In becoming man's substitute, Christ did not manifest his power as the Son of God. He ranked himself among the sons of men. He was to bear the trial of temptation as a man, in man's behalf, under the most trying circumstances, and leave an example of faith and perfect trust in his Heavenly Father. Christ knew that his Father would supply him food when it would gratify: him to do so. He would not in this severe ordeal, when hunger pressed him beyond measure, prematurely diminish one particle of the trial allotted to him by exercising his divine power. Fallen man, when brought into ened places, could not have the power to work miracles on his own behalf, to save himself from pain or anguish, or to give himself victory over his enemies. It was the purpose of God to test and prove the race, and give them an opportunity to velop cliaracter by bringing them ly into trying positions to test their faith and confidence in his love and power. The life of Christ was a perfect pattern. He was ever, by his example and precept, teaching man that God was his ence, and that in God should be his faith and firm trust. Christ knew that Satan was a liar from the beginning, and it. required strong control to listen to the propositions of this insulting deceiver, and not instantly buke his bold assumptions. Satan pected to provoke the Son of God to gage in controversy with him ; and he hoped that thus, in his extreme weakness and agony of spirit, he could obtain vantage over him. He designed to vei·t the words of Christ and elaim vantage, and call to his aid his fallen gels to use their utmost power to prevail against and overcome him. The Saviour of the world had no troversy with Satan; who was expelled from Heaven because he was no longer worthy of a place there. He who could influence the angels of God against their Supreme Ruler, and against his Son, their loved commander, and enlist their thy for himself, was capable of any tion. Four thousand years he had been warring against the government of God, and had lost none of his skill or power to tempt and deceive. Because man fallen could not overcome Satan with his human strength, Clll'ist came from the royal courts of Heaven to help him with his human and divine strength combined. Christ knew Adam in Eden, with his superior ages, might have withstood the of Satan, and conquered him. He also knew that it was not possible for man, out of Eden, separated from the light and love of God since the fall, to resist the tions of Satan in his own strength. In der to bring hope to man, and save him from complete ruin, he humbled himself to take man's nature, that, with hi" divine power combined with the human, he might reach man where he is. He obtains for the fallen sons and daughters of Adam that strength which it is impossible for them to gain for themselves, that in his name they may overcome the temptations of Satan. The exalted Son of God in assuming humanity draws himself nearer to man by standing as the sinner's substitute. He identifies himself with the sufferings and afflictions of men. He was tempted in all points as man is tempted, that he might know how to succor those who should be tempted. Christ overcame on the sinner's behalf. Jacob, in the night vision, saw earth connected with Heaven by a ladder ing to the throne of God. He saw the angels of God, clothed with garments of heavenly brightness, passing down from Heaven and up to Heaven upon this ing laddm·. The bottom of this ladder rested upon the earth, while the top of it reached to the highest Heavens, and rested upon the throne of Jehovah. The ness from the throne of God beamed down upon this ladder, and reflected a light of inexpressible glory upon the earth. This ladder represented Christ who had opened the communication between earth and Heaven. In Christ's humiliation he descended to the very depth of human woe in sympathy and pity for fallen man, which was represented to Jacob by one end of the ladder resting upon the earth, while the top of the ladder, reaching unto Heaven, represents the divine power of Christ, who grasps the Infinite, and thus links earth to Heaven, and finite man to the infinite God. Through Ch1;st the communication is opened between God and man. Angels may pass from Heaven to earth with messages of love to fallen man, and to minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvat.ion. It is through Christ alone that the heavenly messengers ter to men. Adam and Eve in Eden were placed der most favorable circumstances. It was their privilege to hold communion with God and angels. They were without the condemnation of sin. The light of God and angels was with them, and around about them. The Author of their ence was their teacher. But they fell neath the power and temptations of the artful foe. Four thousand years had tan been at work against the government of God,and he had obtained strength and perience from determined practice. Fallen men had not the advantages of Adam in Eden. They had been separating from God for four thousand yea1·s. The dom to understand, and power to resist, the temptations of Satan had become less and less, until Satan seemed to reign umphant in the earth. Appetite and sion, tlw love of the world and presum ous sins, were the great branches of evil out of which evety species of crime, lence, and corruption grew. Satan was defeated in his object to overcome Christ upon the point of tite ; and here in the wilderness Christ achieved a victory in behalf of the race upon the point of appetite, making it sible for man in all future time in his name to overcome the strength of appetite on his own behalf. Satan was not willing to cease his efforts until he had tried ery means to obtain victory over the world's Redeemer. He knew that with himself all was at stake, whether he or Christ should be victor in the contest. And, in order to awe Christ ·with his perior strength, he carried him to J lem and set him on a pinnacle of the ple, and continued to beset him with temptations. . again demanded of Christ, if he was indeed the Son of God, to give him dence by casting himself from the dizzy bight upon which he had placed him. He urged Christ to show his confidence in the preserving care of his Father by casting himself down from the temple. In Satan's first temptation upon the point of appetite, he had tried to insinuate doubts in regard to God's love a.nd care for Christ as his Son, by presenting his surroundings and his hunger as evidence that he was not in favor with God. He was unsuccessful in this. He next tried to take advantage of the faith and perfect trust Christ had 67 shown in his Heavenly Father to urge him to presumption. " If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concernincr thee; and in their hap.ds they shall thee ·up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." Jesus promptly answered, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." The sin of presumption lies close beside the virtue of perfect faith and confidence in God. Satan flattered himself that he could take advantage of the humanity of Christ to urge him over the line of trust to presumption. Upon this point many souls are wrecked. Satan tried to deceh·e Christ through flattery. He admitted that Christ was right in the wilderness in his faith and confidence that God was hiH Father, under the most trying stances. He then urged Christ to give him one more proof of his entire ence upon God, one more evidence of his faith that he was the Son of God, by ing himself from the temple. He told Christ that if he was indeed the Son of God he had nothing to fear; for angels were at hand to 'lphold him. Satan gave evidence that he understood the Scriptmes by the use he made of .them. The Redeemer of the world wavet·ed not from his integrity and showed that he had perfect faith in his Father's promised care. He would not put the faithfulness and lon· of his Father to a needless trial, although he was in the hands of the enemy, and placed in a position of extreme difficulty and peril. He would not, at Satan's gestion, tempt God by presumptuously perimenting on his providence. Satan had brought in scripture which seemed priate for the occasion, hoping to accomplish his designs by making the application to our Saviour at thi" special time. Christ knew that God could indeed bear him up if he had required him to thro'Y himself from the temple. But to do this unbidden, and to experiment upon his ther's protecting care and love, dared by Satan to do so, would not show his strength of faith. Satan was well aware that if Christ could be prevailed on; unbidden by his Father, to fling himself from the temple to prove his claim to his Heavenly Father's protecting care, he wou ]. l in the very act show the weakness of human nature. Christ carne off victor in the second temptation. He manifested perfect dence and trust in his Father during his severe conflict with the powerful foe. Our Redeemer, in the victory here gained, has left man a perfect pattern, showing him that his only safety is in firm trust and wavering confidence in God in all trials and perils. He refused to presume upon mercy of his Father by placing himself in peril that would make it necessary for his Heavenly Father to display his power to save him from danger. This would be forcing providence on his own account ; and he would not then leave for his people a perfect example of faith and firm trust in God. Satan's object in tempting Ch1ist was to lead him to daring presumption, and to show human weakness that would not make him a perfect pattern for his people. Satan thought that should Christ fail to bear the test of his temptations, there could be no redemption for the race, and his power over them would be complete. (To be Continued.)
