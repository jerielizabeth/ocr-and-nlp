But again, we think the way rough and dark, oh, how dark ! and the desert sands are scorching to our weary feet, and yet we must press on. We look here and there for some earthly prop, but all in vain. We see now and then those whose way seems smooth to us. Ours seems hard. Life's hardships press us heavy, and we almost forget our Source of help. Like Peter to whom the Master predicted a martyr's death, we are ready to say. " Lord and what shall this man do ? " The re-sponse comes back, " What is that to thee ? follow thou me." Then the promise, "As thy day, thy strength shall be," and as thy work so thy reward ; and that will be enough. Oh, then, the Christian's path is not all thorns, and were it all flowers he would never realize the worth of his heavenly home. There his feet will never press the burning sand, nor his flesh feel the pricking thorn, nor his heart be thrust with Satan's sharpened arrows. No, and it is enough that we may here prepare for that glorious home. Now the waves of temptation may roll like liquid mountains around us, yet there is always ground to anchor. Securely may we confide in our faithful Captain until our work is done ; and as one, a humble tried one, once remarked "What if we do receive blows ? why there will lee a reward." Such a reward ! Then every little act for Christ's sake will make up the great sum. Not mighty deeds, but every prayer of faith to God, every sympathizing tear, every worthy word spoken in season, every cup of water to His followers, every worthy example, all, ALL will tell in the final reward. And if our names be found in the Lamb's book of life, and a crown of life await us at Christ's appearing, and we be found among that sinless throng who meet Jesus and his attending angels in the air, oh, then will it not be enough, yea far outweigh with an exceed- ing and eternal weight of glory all our sufferings here ? Blessed hope! Then will blend each heart and tongue, And join in angel strains the song Glory and praise to God most high, Who gave his Son for man to die!  And as each heart, tuned to the lay, Repeats the chorus night and day, All Heaven with loftiest music rings, Of glory to the King of kings. H. D. A. What must it Be to be There! L   58 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. [Vol. xxiv.     and possess the disposition, to persecute the truly pious: as they, in their turn, were persecuted when they sustained that character. It is the Church, in her fallen condition, that has forever constituted the great persecuting power ; the civil authoritiesŠwheth-er Heathen, Christian, or InfidelŠdoing comparatively little in this. direction ; scarcly anything indeed, except by her instigation. Nay, it is the Church whether Catholic, Episcopalian, or MethodistŠany one who,  claims the exclusive right and title of a Church, that constitutes the great persecuting power of the earth. And any denomination engaging in the work of persecu-tion, does it, of course, upon the ground that they are The Church, to the exclusion of all other persuasions. All the persecutions, in general, from the foundation of the world, may be traced to The Church in this accepta-tion of her character. Who persecuted and slew the prophets, the apostles, the Lord of life and glory ? The Church. Who de-stroyed the lives of more than fifty millions of Protes-tant Christians in the sixteenth century ? The Church. Who drove the Puritans out of England, and the Huguenots out of France, massacreing many thousands of them in the most barbarous mannerŠand hung the Quakers at Boston ? The Church. Who formerly persecuted the Methodists in the old country, and more recently in this, while they sustained the character of a holy people? The Church. And if the question be asked,ŠWho are now kindling the flame of persecution against the Free Methodists ; and all who go in for full salvation, as taught by Wesley, within our own pale, even ? the same humiliating answer must be givenŠIt is the Church. She it isŠno matter what her denominational designation may be; since it is her affiliation with persecutors that gives her this bad eminenceŠshe it isŠbeing fallen to the infernal height of Popish infallibility and exclusivenessŠwho excommunicates her best membersŠlay and clerical Šostensibly for contumacy ; the stereotyped general charge of all fallen churches against all reputed here-tics; but really for the reason for which Cain slew his brotherŠ"Because her own works are evil, and her brethren's righteous." And what else could be expected but that the great body of our people, preachers and all, should sink their Christian practice in a loose morality, and their morality in the fashionable sins of the day, when " our chief ministers"Šthe BishopsŠare understood to lead the way ? Just look at the example they have set us for a few, years past in respect to practical godliness. See one of them, as he mingles in the scenes of a public banquet, given him by the people of the world, "whose friendship," which " is enmity with God," he reciprocated and enjoyed with such evident gusto at a rum hotel. And another, who so far forgot the proprieties of the occasion, not to say the principle involved, as to ridicule a, prominent member of the Philadelphia. Conference for simply inquiringŠas in duty boundŠwhether a brother whose character was under examination before the Conference, were a slave-holder. See them, one and allŠpossessed of vast fortunes, as the most of them are said to beŠdrawing there heavy salaries from "the proceeds of the Book Con-cern," made sacred by the original charter of that institution to " the support of the distressed traveling preachers and their families, and the widows and orphans of those who have died in the work; there-by depriving those worthy claimants, in many in-stances, of the ordinary comforts of life. See them also with eight or nine months of the year allowed them to " travel through the connection at large, and oversee the spiritual and temporal business of the Church"Šexclusive of the time necessary to attend the ConferencesŠyet never making their appearance within the bounds of many of the Conferences during the entire interval of their annual sessions. And see them extending the segis of their protection over "the sum of all villainies ;" by throwing the whole weight of their influence against the impending anti-slavery action of the General Conference, as in there quad-drennial address of 1856; and by conferring holy orders upon slave-holding preachers, in utter disregard of the Discipline which they have solemnly vowed to keep and administer. But we are done. Our task has been one of painful interest; not only because of the pain we have felt in being called upon, in the order of Providence, to present to the Church the ugly portrait of her own character; but more especially for the reason that she was not in a condition to sit for a better picture. We mourn over her defection from God ; and from Methodism, which we still love, as ever, with an almost idolatrous devo-tion. We still love the Methodist Episcopal church; and mean no disrespect toward her in anything we have said in this discourse. And if we have felt it incumbent on us to sound the note of alarm, and to admonish her, in this way, of her Ł impending over-throw, it is not because we desire such a catastrophe, but because we fear it. Nothing is plainer to us than that the old Methodist ship, unless she change her course, will inevitably sinkŠengulphed in her own worldliness and prideŠand be irrecoverably lost. But while we grieve over the sinking condition of the old ship, in which we have so long sailed upon the ocean of life, we rejoice in the persuasion that God is prepar-ing a life-boat to take off any passengers who may feel disposed to make their escape before she goes down. It is Enough. " FOR we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities ; but in all points was tempted like as we are, yet without sin." Were it not that some such declaration had been written for the child of God, and left upon record on the sacred page, how often some afflicted soul would have been wrecked in a maelstrom of temptation ? Many a weak vessel and frail bark without this compass and anchor would have been stranded upon the shores of unbelief. But here again is the Christian mariner's light-house, guiding him through every danger, buoying him above every temptation, and beyond every sorrow ; and here, beneath its cheering rays, may toiling hearts find refuge and peace, even a foretaste of' that rest, to be given to all the weary and way-worn, who have so long been upon time's boundless ocean, waiting, to catch a glimpse of the heavenly land ahead. Then never despair. Is it not enough ? But how can it be? ponders the Christian as be enters some fiery ordealŠhow can it he that he who had known the joy of Heaven and tasted its bliss, witnessed its glory, and experienced all its height of happiness, could feel the burden of temptation, as I who am so poor and weak, trembling and fearful, and so unacquainted with the heavenly clime'? Did the dear Redeemer feel this crushing weight that bears me so low ? But stop, doubting soul, think of the garden, the tears, and blood,' the long night of pleading and anguish, of the forty days in the wilderness, weak and hungry, of the powers of darkness pressing down when hanging upon the dreadful cross, and not one to stand by him then. Oh it was at the blessed Sa-viour, that Satan hurled his most fiery darts, and yet all without sin. The promise is real, and every trusting heart may come boldly to the throne of grace, and the despairing ones may see light and joy for them. Oh, is not this enough ? But here we experience earth's losses, bitter disap-pointments, blighted hopes, friends pass away, others prove untrue, the world greets us with scorn, and we realize that this is not our rest, and with all our burden of grief', we turn to Heaven for aid. Our great bur- den-bearer knows our wants, and we pour out before him our complaints. He listens, hears, and pities ; and when it suits our case best, he lifts the load and gives us of his love and the comfort of his Holy Spirit. He comes in and sups with us and we with him. Oh then, had we no other heart to whom we could turn for sympathy, is it not enough that the dearest of all friends is ours and we are his? Could we but look clearly into some gospel mirror and see how afflictions and trials, disappointments and blighted hopes, serve to purify the heart, win the affections to God, and cause the image of the Redeemer to reflect itself in us more and more, we should oftener feel and pray. "Subdued and instructed at length to thy will, My hopes and my longings I fain would resign; Oh, give me a heart that can wait and be still, Nor know of a wish or a pleasure but Thine." Wiro does not delight to think of the beauty and splendor of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, built of pure gold like unto pure glass ; her walls of Jasper, gates of pearl, streets of gold; and her pure river of water of life. All that we can imagine will convey to our minds but a faint idea of the splendor of the saints' heavenly home. When we gather together what is gorgeous and precious and beautiful, in the visible creation, it will not compare with the final home of the saints, will not compass the greatness, nor exhibit the loveliness of the portion which awaits the people of God. As the shining company of the redeemed take the circuit of the celestial city, as they walk about Zion, and go about her, " telling the towers thereof, mark-ing well her bulwarks and considering her palaces," who can doubt that they say one to another, As we have heard so have we seen in the city of our God. We heard that here the wicked cease from troubling, and now we experience that heavenly peace and rest. We heard that here we should be with the Lord, and now we behold him face to face. We heard that here we should know, even as we are known, and now the am-ple page of truth is open to our inspection. We heard that here, with the crown on the head and harp in the hand, we should execute the will, and hymn the praises of our God, and now we wear the diadem, and wake the melody. They can take to themselves the words which the dying leader, Joshua, used of the Israelites. "Not one thing hath failed us of all the good things which the Lord our God spake concerning us; all are come to pass, and not one thing hath failed thereof." Jesus said, "In my Father's house are many man-sions ; and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also." How vain must be our hope of entering into Heaven, into those mansions
