Vol. 1, No. 6. THE SIGNS _ OF THE TIMES. 43. of an earthly monarch. The king sits upon his throne, with his officers and servants around him. Messages are constantly being received by him from his subjects in the dif-ferent parts of his kingdom. , When he learns what. is needful to be done, he dispatches a trusty messenger to perform it in his name. He also has officers in different parts of his kingdom who faithfully report to him the state of things in their several districts. Thus the king is able to attend to the wants of his subjects, and to oversee their actions, in all parts of the dominion, however large it may be. Somewhat so I understand it is that the Lord employs his servants, the angels. He always works by means, or agents. The angels are his officers, or messengers, whom he has appointed to have charge of the affairs of this earth. They watch over God's people, and administer to, their wants. They bear the prayers of the saints up before the Lord, and come again to answer them according to his direction. The proof of this is abundant. Thus Paul says, " But to which of the angels said he at any time,'Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool ? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?" Heb. 1 : 13, 14. This is a direct statement of the position above taken. Upon this subject David says, " The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them." Ps. 34 : 7. This grand truth is beau-tifully illustrated in Jacob's dream. As he was traveling alone in the wilderness, he lay down upon the ground at night to sleep. " And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to Heaven ; and, behold, the angels of God as-cending and descending on it." Gen. 28 : 12. This dream was given to teach Jacob that the angels are constantly passing backward and forward between Heaven and earth. This fact is just as true now as it was then. We have another illustration of this truth in the history of Daniel. He was mourning over the sad state of his people who were cap-tives under the king of Persia. For three whole weeks he fasted, and prayed to God to open the way for his people to return to their own land. At the end of this time an angel came to Daniel and said, "Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days ; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia." Chap. 10 : 12, 13. As soon as Daniel begins to pray, God sends an angel to perform his request. The angel goes to the Persian court and seeks to influence the king to let Israel return to their own land. The king was so opposed to this that the angel was not able to prevail with him. At last another mighty angel joins the first one and then they succeed. No one in the Persian court saw those angels. The king himself was not aware of their presence .or their influence upon him ; yet they brought him to do just what he did not mean to do. This is the way in which the angels co-op-erate with God's children in their efforts for the conversion of souls. Our hearts are moved to pray for a son, a companion, or a friend. God sends an angel to impress the heart and trouble the mind. Or, we are in distress. We cry for help, and God sends an angel to deliver us. Nor are they slow in coming. See an instance of this in Dan. 9 : 21-23. " Whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, 0 Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and under-standing. At the beginning of thy supplica-tions, the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee." When the prophet began his prayer, Ga-briel was in Heaven ' Ł but before he ceased he was at his side ! Quicker 'than lightning, then, the messengers can speed on their er-rands. Ezekiel, describing the rapidity of their movements, says they " ran and re-turned as the appearance of a flash of light-ning." Chap. 1: 14. So when God hears the cries of his chil-dren, he immediately sends an angel right from his throne to answer their prayers and relieve their wants. This is very comforting to the child of God. We find a very remarkable instance of this recorded in Acts 12 : " Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church. And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter  also. (Then were the days of unleaven bread.) And when he had apprehended him, lie put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intend-ing after Easter to bring him forth to, the people. Peter, therefore, was kept in prison ; but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. "And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night,  Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers be-fore the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison. And he smote Peter On the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And Łhis chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him, and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision. When they were passed the first and:the sec-ond ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city, which openedto them of his own accord. And they went out, and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews." Verses 1-11. Here all the power of the king was arrayed against a few helpless Christians. James, they had already killed. Peter was strictly guarded in 'prison, awaiting his execution. To make escape or rescue impossible, he was bound with chains, between two soldiers, sev-eral others being placed to assist them. He was put into an inner prison, from which it was impossible to escape except by passing these guards and breaking open an iron gate ! What did Peter's friens do? Bribe the guard ? overpower the soldiers? or break into the prison? No ; but they went to God in earnest prayer. -"But prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him." God heard their prayers, granted their request, and sent an angel to deliver Peter. Simply by his touch the chains fell from Pe-ter's hands, the guards became senseless, the iron gate gives way, and the child of God is saved ! Cannot Christians trust in such a God as this ? Are not his angels ready and able to deliver them from all their foes when it is necessary ? It is truly as the Psalmist says, " The angel of the Lord encampeth ..round about them that fear him, and deliver-eth them." Ps. 34 : 7. Many other instances are recorded in the Bible, where God has sent his angels to min-ister to' his children. They are so numerous that we can barely refer the reader to a few of the most interesting of them. Does Abra-ham send his servant on an important mis-sion ? He says to him, The Lord " shall send his angel before thee." Gen. 24 : 7. D6es Jacob bless his children at his death ? He says, ".The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads." Gen. 48 : 16. Does the Lord direct the Jews to go into Canaan ? He says to them, " Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared." Ex. 23 : 20. Is Elijah about to perish in the wilderness ? " Then an angel touched him, and said unto him, ' Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of wa- ter at his head." 1 ings 19 : 5, 6. Is _Daniel delivered out of the lions' den ? He'  says, " My God bath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me." Dan. 6 : 22. Is the gospel to be opened to the Gentiles ? An angel is sent to Cornelius. Acts 10. Is Paul's life in dan-ger 1 An angel of God stands by his side to assure him of safety. 'Acts 27 : 23. What more shall we say? Time would fail us to mention a tithe of such instances where the angels of God are directly men-tioned as having acted an important part in the affairs of men. Add to these the innu-merable instances where, though not directly mentioned, yet evidently the angels were present, and we begin to have some concep-tion of the prominent part which they have to act in God's work upon earth. If this was so in Bible times, is it not so now ? Why not? THE ANGELS EXECUTE GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON THE WICKED. But while the angels are thus messengers of mercy to those who do good, they are also messengers of wrath to those who do evil. Thus the Lord commissioned angels to go and destroy Sodom. The angel said to Lot, " We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath, sent us to destroy it." Gen. 19 : 13. When Balaam went to pro- phesy against Israel, the Lord sent his angel to slay him. Num. 22 : 22. So when David had sinned, the Lord sent his angel to de-stroy Jerusalem. 1 Chron. 21 : 14-30. When ;the Assyrians had blasphemed God, "The Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria." 2 Chron. 32 : 21. When Herod was exalted in himself, and received praise as a god, "im-mediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory ; and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost." Acts 12 : 23. Indeed; we have reason to believe that the sudden judgments which frequently overtake evil-doers, are executed upon them by the angels of God. When the gospel is closed, all the wicked are to be gathered by the angels and cast into the lake of fire. Thus Jesus says, " The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels. As, therefore, the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his king-dom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a fur-nace of fire." Matt. 13 : 39-42. D. M. CANRIGHT. San Jose, Cal. A Dish of Fables. Ł IN the following brief extract we find at least seven direct antiscriptural statements. It is a good illustration of the blindness of those (even great men) who are led by tradi-tion instead of the plain teachings of the word of God. Henry Ward Beecher says :- " How blessed is the truth which comes to us, that we are not as the beasts that die ; that we are as the gods that live ! That for which we were made is immortality ; and our journey is rough, straight, burdensome, with many tears. Our journey is not to the grave. I am not growing into old age to be blind, and to be deaf, and to be rheumatic, and to shrink a miserable cripple into the corner, shaking and tottering and forgetting all that I ever knew. The best part of me is un-touched. I sit enshrined within the me. The soul, the reason, the moral sense, the power to think, the power to will, the power to love, the power to admire purity, and to reach out after it-that is not touched Łby time, though its instrument and means of outer demonstra-tion be corroded and failing. " This body is but a chrysalis, and when we break through it, we rise on wings by the attraction of God, and by the propulsion of our inevitable desire and need, and are for-ever with the Lord."-[Extract of sermon.] Now let these statements be arraigned be-fore the tribunal of God's word, and see if they will stand the test. Bible. "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing be-falleth them ; as the one dieth, so dieth the other ; yea, they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast ; for all is vanity. Eccl. 3 : 19. Beecher. " We are not as the beasts that die." Bible. "They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust." Job 17 : 16. " For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning." Gen. 37 : 35. Beecher. " Our journey is not to the grave." Bible. "Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years ; and was gathered to his people." Gen. 25 : 8. Beecher. " I am not growing into old age." Bible. " For the living know that they shall die ' Ł but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished." Eccl. 9 : 5, 6. " His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish." Ps. 146 : 4. Beecher. In -describing what is not affect-ed by the ravages of time' and death, he men-tions, " the power to think, the power to will, the power to love," &c. Bible. "Thou shalt surely die." Gen. 2 : 17. Old Serpent. " Ye shall not surely die." "Ye shall be as gods." Gen. 3 : 4, 5. Beecher. "We are not as the beasts that die." " We are as the gods that live." Mr. Beecher seems to side with Satan in the great controversy, just as squarely giving God the lie, as language can do it. 0 foolish man ! Better for thee to come over on the Lord's side, for Satan was a liar from the be- ginning. M. E. CORNELL. BLESSED is he who learns to Profit by his wants and infirmities, and who, in all the privations he endures, is still submissive toŁ the will of God. Answer .to Prayer. WE copy the following remarkable case from the Bible Banner :- " The case I refer to transpired in 1831 or '32, in Oakland county, Michigan. The parties were schoolmates of the writer, and he was living in the neighborhood at the time, and can vouch for the truth of the statement. The following are the facts in the case : Mr. Chester Goodrich had .married a Miss Rhoda Mathews. She had made a profession of re-ligion, but he had not. After their marriage she became cold and back-slidden. While in thin state she was taken very ill. The best medical help seemed to do no good, and she became so low and weak that she could not lift her hand to her head and could only speak in a, whisper. Her physician gave her up, and told her sorrowing husband that he could do no more, and that she must die. This was after a council of physicians had sat on her case and. pronounced it hopeless. The husband felt that there was no hope but in God, and was powerfully impressed that he must carry her case to him in prayer. Ac-cordingly, retiring to the woods back of his house in a secluded place, he knelt, and tried to pray. It was the first time that he had ever offered a prayer. As soon as he began to plead for the life of his wife, a deep con-viction of his own lost and sinful condition began to roll on to his mind, and he was led to make confession of his own sins, and his bad influence on his wife, and to plead for pardon for himself and her restoration to both spiritual and bodily health. While he was thus agonizing' for divine help and mercy, a divine peace was given him with the assur-ance that his prayer was heard in behalf of his wife ; so that his prayers and tears were turned into thanksgiving and praises ; and with that feeling he returned to his house to find her dressed and sitting up in the rocking chair, healed, but weak: While he was thus praying, and at the moment of his own de-. liverance, a power came over her, and she Suddenly sprang up in bed, clapped her hands and praised God, saying he had healed her soul and body, called to her nurse for her dress, put it on, arose and seated herself in the rocking chair, as noted above. She re-covered strength rapidly and was the mother of several children. The husband passed away some years since, but she was alive and well the last I heard from her, and living with a son at Howard, Livingston county, Michigan. This is but one of a thousand of such cases occurring from time to time, and is proof conclusive that God hears and ans-wers prayer, and that Christ is still the Great Heenal.er of both the souls and the bodies of m   REV. JOHN SCOTFORD. Burlingame, Kan., April 15, 1874. No Compromise. As I grow older as a parent, my views are changing fast as to the degree of conformity to the world' which we should allow to our children. I am horror-struck to count up the profligate children of Ilious persons and even ministers. The door at which those influences enter, which countervail parehtial instruc-tion and example, I am persuaded, is yield-ing to the ways of good society ; by dress, books, and amusements, an atmosphere is formed which is not that of Christianity. More than ever do I feel that our families must stand in a kind but determined opposi-tion to the fashions of the world, breasting the waves like the Eddystone lighthouse. And I have found nothing yet which requires more courage and independence than to rise, even a little, but decidedly, above the par of the religious world around us. Surely, the way in which we commonly go on is not that way of self-denial, and sacrifice, and cross-bearing which the New Testament talks of. -Rev. J. W. Alexander, D. D. Omens. Is not He whose right it is to reign, pre-paring his people for some great crisis which is to precede his coming to claim the king-doms of this world ? So we are disposed to think. The signs of the times are porten-tous. Let us, beloved, keep our lamps trim-med and brightly burning-looking for, and hastening unto, the corning of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Jesus, our absent Lord, has told us that he would come again. He has been away nearly two thousand years. Nearly six thousand years has he stood forth before a fallen, redeemed race, as the Lamb newly slain. The jubilee of Heaven and earth -the grand Sabbatic year-is about to break upon us. By the foreshowings of Scripture, , we seem to see that there will be a short, sharp conflict with the man of sin. But though we may be called to pass through seas of blood, it will but quicken our heart-longing cry, " Come, Lord Jesus, come quick-ly !"-Guide to Holiness.
