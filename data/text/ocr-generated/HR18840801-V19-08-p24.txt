FOR many years, eminent medical savants have sought earnestly through the vegetable and mineral worlds for some substance by means of which the high temperature often prevailing in typhoid, malarial, and other fevers, might be reduced with rapidity and safety to the patient. A few substances have been found which pro-duce a decline in temperature when administered in enormous and frequently repeated doses ; but such administration has often been found to be decidedly detrimental to the patient, producing not infrequently serious injury to the stomach, kidneys, and sometimes the nervous system. So great is the danger of such injurious results, few careful practitioners have cared to adopt the heroic " antipyretic " medication recom-mended by experimenters, preferring to allow their patients to burn with fever, mitigated only by such simple means as are commonly employed by nurses, than to require them to combat the poisonous influences of a drug in addition to the morbid element of the disease. Happily, however, it is not necessary to leave the patient to the unaided efforts of nature. By cool sponging of the surface, persistently and thoroughly applied, by large, cool compresses placed over the abdomen and chest, or even the whole front of the body, and changed as often as warm, or every three to five minutes, by frequently repeated cool packs, by cold water drinking, by ice-packs to the spine, by constant application of ice or frozen compresses to the head, by forcing perspiration by copious hot drinks and a warm blanket pack,Å by any or all of these means the temperature may be re-duced with promptness in nearly every case. However, cases will now and then occur in which the temperature remains dangerously high, notwithstanding the thorough application of the above means. What shall be done'? Several years ago our attention was called to a series of experiments made by Dr. Winternitz, Professor of Hydropathy in the Medical Uni-versity of Vienna, for the purpose of determin-ing the influence upon temperature, of ene-mas of water of different temperatures in cases of fever. The results claimed by Prof. Winter-nitz were so striking that we improved the first opportunity to repeat his experiments, and with  such results as have justified the continued use of this means of lowering temperatures in fevers, in cases in which the ordinary measures were not efficient. The only objection we have found to the method has been the inconvenience to the patient occasioned by the frequent use of the bed-pan. In a recent case in which we found it necessary to resort to this method, the nurse observed that if the tin oan of the fountain syringe used in administering the enema hap-pened to be lowered below the level of the bed on which.the patient lay, water which had pre-viously been introduced into the rectum returned readily through the tube into the can. On learning this fact, the attendants were instructed to employ the enema in this way. From one to two pints of water, of seventy or seventy-five degrees temperature, were allowed to pass into the bowels; and after being retained for five or ten minutes, or until the patient experienced uncomfortable sensations, it was made to pass nut through the tube by simply lowering the reservoir to the level of the floor. A new sup-ply of water of a proper temperature being introduced into the reservoir, it was again raised to the proper hight, and the operation so contin-ued until six quarts of water had been used. Then the patient was allowed to rest half an hour or an hour, according to the hight of the fever, and the same process was repeated. Careful record was made of the temperature of the patient just before the treatment and immediately after. It was found to be invariably reduced from one to one and a half degrees by each treatment. The temperature, which had been exceedingly obstinate previous to the employ-ment of this method, ranging from 104 to 105 degrees, during the intervals between the treat-ments would of course rise somewhat, but each time it stopped short of the point reached during the previous interval, so that in the course of a few hours the fever was brought down to very nearly a normal temperature. The temper-ature of the water, when taken after passing through the bowels, was found to have risen each time from ten to thirteen degrees. The great capacity of water for absorbing heat renders it one of the most useful of all sub-stances for lowering the temperature ; and it is readily apparent that, by the means described,
