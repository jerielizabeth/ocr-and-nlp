' gt No. 8.7 THE REVIEW AND HERALD,. 63  "That those who live in the times when a prophecy is fulfilled, should have a more complete and satisfacto- ry view of the things or objects treated of by such proph- ecy, than those who lived before its accomplishment, is, indeed, plain enough ; just as plain, as that a man who has been at Constantinople will understand the topography of it better than a writer understood it, who has undertaken to describe that city and yet has never  visited it. But how this will make the words of the writer in question to mean any more than the ideas which he himself attached to them, I do not see. I take the meaning of any language to be, the idea which the speaker or writer himself attached to it. Just this, and neither more nor less, all right interpretation will give as his meaning." " Whenever we are asked, then, whether any particu- lar prophecy is obscure, the proper answer always is, to ask, whether it does not communicate, in an intelligible manner, just as much as the author of it Ł designed it should communicate ? And this, of course, is its meaningŠits full meaning. The sense of any words, is the idea which the author of them intended to convey. How much then did the author of any prophecy intend to convey by it? This is the fair question; and one which should be always asked by an interpreter. And when this is rightly answered, the full meaning of the prophecy is unfolded  They did what they intended to do, and were commissioned to do ; and did it well; and then they ceased to do. Why should we imagine this to be other- wise ?" " That is, in other words, men are better operated upon by what they do not understand, than by what they do understand. For my part, I know not how to believe this. If I worship God at all, it is on account of what I do know of him, and not on account of what I do not know. If I believe in the argument from prophecy, in order to prove the divine origin and authority of the Scriptures, it is on account of what I understand of it, and know has been fulfilled, and not on account of what I do not understand. The Samaritans were reproved by the Saviour, for wor- shipping 'they knew not what;' it is desirable, then, for Christians to know what they are to expect and believe, in order that they may know what to do and how to worship. In fine, for myself I have believed, and must still continue to believe, that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." I must believe that when he reveals any thing to men, he does not wrap it up in darkness. I must continue to cherish the belief, that leave them ignorant. All which he intends to accom- plish he does accomplish. His accredited messengers are not " blind leaders of the blind," but " clothed with light and salvation." They are not men be- reeved of their understanding, their reason, their con- sciousness, their free-agency ; but the most enlighten- ed, the most rational, the most free, of all men on the face of the earth."

Taylor. BRO. WHITE : After an absence of seven Sabbaths, I am again at home. The last meeting that I attended was at Roosevelt. It was the monthly meeting for Os- wego Co. The attendance of the brethren was large, and the Lord, by his Spirit, worked for us, in correct- ing us of our wrongs. Truly it is no time to lay down our watch, to rest on our leas, or to look behind us. On first-day, six were buried with Christ in baptism, including our much-esteemed Bro. L. C. Patten, wife, and two daughters. They also united with the church at Roosevelt. The Lord's eye of mercy is on that tam- 'ly for good. May they ever realize it, and faithful- ly love and serve him. Our afflicted,et beloved Bro. y  Edson, hed strength given  him  to attend this meeting, for which I felt very thankful. C. G. TAYLOR Adams' Center, N. Y. July 5, 1864. Sister S. Bliven writes from Laurel Glen.,R I. I am trying to keep the Lord's Sabbath, and am loco.  kin for the time to come when I with the rest of the comg-mandment keepers shall receive a crown of glory that fatleth not away. Let us be faithful that we may have a right to the tree of life. Sister M. Bean, writes from South Troy, Vt.: The blessed hope I have, reaches forward to the resurree-tion morn, when the loved ones we have laid away will burst the fetters of the tomb, and come forth, being made immortal, no more to suffer and die. Having the blest hope of soon seeing Jesus, with the redeemed of all  ages, it leads me to purify myself even as he is pure. My heart glows with gratitude to my heavenly Father, for this hope, and for the way he has led me, especially for above seven years, since I have found it good to obey God'and keep his commandments. How much now I delight in the Sabbath of the Lord. I love the truth, and am earnestly striving for Bible holiness, believing it to be my privilege to be enabled to reckon myself dead indeed unto sin, and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. I praise the Lord for what he is doing East and West. From Bro. Matteson. BRO. WHITE : June 5th I commenced a series of meetings in New Denmark, some in that place being anxious to hear the truth. I held sixteen meetings. Six individuals decided to keep the commandments of God, and unite with the remnant people. Two were baptized. Several others have commenced to keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord, but have not yet fully decided to receive present truth. May the Lord help duty  to see their clearly. themthe I held two meetings in Manitowouc. Some interest was manifested. June 29th, commenced meetings near Appleton. Found two brethren trying to keep the commandments. Held five meetings. Some gave heed and believed the word spoken. They were desirous to hear more, but  circumstances at home called me away. I trust our kind heavenly Father, who has commenced to bring his remnant people into the unity of the faith, will also open the way here, and raise up a church to his own glory. July 4th,I arrived home and found the brethren still meetingspressingtheirthat enjoying good and on way to the kingdom. There is a wide field in this north- ern part of' Wisconsin, where the third angel'smes- sage has never been preached. May the Lord work with his people, and we be ready for the coming of our beloved Master. JOHN MATTESON. Fey  sippi, TR,Ł  Bee.. J. H. Warren writes form Medford, Minn. : I feel greatly encouraged from week to week as the Review comes to hand bringing the solemn truths that belong to this generation, and also the cheeringtesti- monies of the dear brethren   and sisters scattered abroad, who have the faith of Jesus, and are keeping commandments of God. Let us hold on a little longer, for it will be but a lit- tie while before "He that shall come will come, and will not tarry." It is my determination to overcome, and be gathered with God's people, when Jesus shall come, Ł Or the $1,000 donation which the Pope sent to the United States to be distributed by Bishop Timon, of Buffalo, for the benefit of the wounded soldiers, $500 was for the wounded of the federal army, and $500 for of the rebels.

I have given in all at this place ten discourses. Several acknowledged that we have the truth. But when we talked to them of the importance of laying aside all filthiness of the flesh, they thought that they could not do that. I think that several will make up their minds to obey the truth ; and may God help them to walk in the light. I here got two new subscribers for the Review, and sold a few books. Yours in hope. L. G.

Let me look to the act, and leave the end to God. ŠBishop Hale. —,--___ FAITH AND WORKS.ŠIt is an unhappy division that has been made between faith and works. Though in my intellect I may divide them, just as in the candle I know there is light and heat, yet put out the candle and they are both goneŠone remains not without the other ; so it is with faith and works.  A.DVANCE IN THE PRICE or PRAYERS.ŠA writer in one of our cotemporaries tells of an Irish domestic in her family, who, having heard of the death of her mother in the old country, went to the priest to make provision for the good woman's soul, On her return her employer asked the result. She freely related it, saying that the priest had consoled her on her loss, and sympathized in her affliction. Her mother's soul was in purgatory, whence it could be relieved by prayer ; and cheerfully the loving girl gave two dollars, that as many prayers might be said for its repose. "Were the prayers said in public?" "No, mam ; the priest wrote down my mother's name in a book, that there might be no mistake. He will say them in private. When my sister died, before the war I only paid half a dollar each for prayers for the same purpose; but the priest assured me the present charge was rightŠthat 'prayers had riz.'" 0 if Unary friticeo, DIED, of congestion of the lungs, in Marion, Iowa, June 18, 1864, our beloved sister, Ruth Halloway aged 54 years.

No man is more miserable than he that bath no adversity; that man is not tried whether be be good or bad. And God never crowns those virtues which are only faculties and dispositions ; but every act of virtue is an ingredient in reward : God so dresses us for Heaven.ŠTaylor. Bro. W. Nichols writes from Winsdor, Cal.: I feel that if there ever was a State that needed to be enlight- ened in regard to the Advent doctrine and Sabbath, it is this one. The other day I heard of a Seventh-day Adventist, and started to hunt him up. I inquired of a man if he knew of any one that kept the seventh DIED of dropsy, in Washington, N.
