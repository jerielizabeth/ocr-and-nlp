612 t41 'rHE SIGNS OF. THE TIMES. Vol. 20, No. 39. Christ says, "My word . . . shall not re- turn unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." isa. 55 :11. "Truth crushed to earth will rise again; The eternal years of God are hers; But error wounded writhes in pain, And dies among her worshipers." One sheep has strayed from the fold and is lost. What does the Shepherd now do?ŠHe does the only thing that a good shepherd.  can do, he leaves the ninety and nine, andgoes in search of the lost sheep until he finds it, and when he finds it, he layeth it on. his shoulders, rejoicing, and ben reth it home, and then calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying, "Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost." Luke 15 : 4-6. The entire universe of worlds is the flock before whom the Good Shepherd went in creation, and over whom he presided after creation. Ł Jer. 17 :12. It is commonly spoken of as one fam-ily, with God as the Father and Christ as the elder brother. Eph. 3: 14, 15.. When our world was lost in .sin, Christ left the u n fallen worlds and caine to reclaim the one that was lost. When-  he came to this earth on his mission of love, he declared,"The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." Luke 19 : 10. "I am not sent but unto the lost 'sheep of the. house of Israel." Matt. 15 : 24. "The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." Matt. 20:. 28. "I am the Good Shepherd; the Good Shep-herd giveth his life for the sheep." John 10: 11. It is here directly stated that he came in search of the lost sheep. WHEN DID HE GIVE HIS LIFE FOR THE SHEEP? There can be no question but that he did so give his life on earth, from infancy until its close on Calvary's cross, yet it is equally clear that this is not the time that he first offered to die for the lost. It is said that he was a "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Rev. 13 : 8. In the counsels of eternity, before man was created, the plan of redemption was laid for the lost. This must needs be, or else God was overtaken by an 'unlooked-for 'emergency when man sinned. We cannot conceive of such a thing as this, for God is not as man to be thus -mocked by his plans. One thing is certain, that the plan of redemption was laid before man was created, for it is plainly stated that Christ was a lamb slain from the foundation of time world. When, then, must the plan have been provided? and why was it so laid? Evi- dently the plan of redemption was laid far back in eternity, when it was decided to peo- ple the universe with intelligentŁbeings, all of whom should be permitted to exercise the right of choice between right and wrong do-ing. By investing man with the right of choice, God must take the risk of sin enter-ing the universe. This does not make God in any way responsible for sin, but it does become necessary for a provision to be made to meet the possibility of sin entering. This he does by offering his Son.to die on the sinner's behalf; and this Christ does by offer-ing himself to die for sinners, a voluntary. substitute for the sinner, that the sinner through him might be. reclaimed: That this plan was devised in the counsels of eternity, and revealed only when it became necessary, is plain from the following .scrip-tures:Š "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy  calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest." 2 Tim. 1: 9, 10. "Now to him that is able to stablish you accord-ing to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which bath been kept in silence through -times eternal, but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eter-nal. God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith." Rom. 16 : 25, 26, Revised Version. "That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and-to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world bath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ; to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eter-nal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord." Eph. 3: 8-11. Here we have the whole matter very plainly and simply stated. He bath saved us and called us according to his own purpose, which he purposed in Christ before the world began. This purpose was an eternal purpose. It was kept in silence through times eternal. Dur- ing this time in which it was kept in silence it was hid in God. The thing that was hid and kept in silence from eternity was the plan of saving sinners through Christ. Since this thing was hid and kept in silence through times eternal, it-  was known and understood unto those by whom it was hid and kept in silence, that is, to God and to Christ. To all others it was hid and kept in silence; there fore, none who chose to sin knew of any possibility of return from sill. Since this plan was devised in the counsels of eternity, when the plan of creating and.  peopling a universe was laid, it is clear that, as the creation was with reference to time uni- verse, so the plan of redemption Łwas not for one world only, but for any world in the uni- verse that should. fall under sin; and any in- dividual in any world who should thus fall, would be offered pardon through Christ. Hence, doubtless, the fallen angels were offered pardon until they passed the bound-aries beyond which there is no desire to return, as when men in this world commit the sin against 'the Holy Ghost, and the sad words are forced from Christ,"Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone." To this world by the scriptures of time prophets it is not made known unto the nations for the obedience of faith. When was it made known according to the scriptures of the prophets? According to the prophet Moses, of whom it was said that Christ when he came would be.a prophet like unto him (Dent. 18 :18), it was first made known to Adam and Eve during the first conversation of Christ with them after they had sinned (Gen. 3:1-15). These Ł are the wonderful words through which the first news ol time possibility of returning to the fold was broken by the pitying Shepherd, as he approached the stray-ing sheep, torn, bruised, sad, and despairing: "I will pitt enmity between thee and-  the woman,and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Ł What unspeakable joy filled time hearts of these poor, despairing souls when to them it was revealed that, through the manifold wis- dom and boundless love of God, and the ever-lasting love of the "Seed of woman," it was their privilege still to choose the right and have the life of bliss from which they had so recently been separated, and to escape time  eternal death, to which they were otherwise doomed 1 Oh, the joy to see earth a paradise once moreŠSatan, and sin, and unrepentant sinners nowhere to be found in time universe of God, the original pUrpose of God in the creating and peopling of the universe with only those who chose time right, to yet be car-ried out without the loss of even one world! "0 God, how unsearchable are thy judgments, and thy ways past finding out!" Truly in this great plan of peopling the universe with only those who voluntarily choose the right, which was begun in time creation and as now revealed will be completed through time plan of redemption, is made known the manifold wisdom of God. The law whose transgression brought sin, and sorrow, and death into this world, was God's law of love,which governs his universe. The redemption offered is not for the purpose of removing this law of love, the transgression of which can only bring unhappiness and death to the transgressor, but to atone for time sins of the penitent and bring them back into their former relation to God, subject to his law, and in harmony with his government. "For this was manifested the Son of God, that he might undo the works of the devil." 1 John 3 :8 (Englishman's Greek New Tes-tament). God through Christ created, and through Christ he now redeems.. "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself -by Jesus Christ, and 'lath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and bath committed unto us the word of reconciliation." 2 Cor. 5 : 18, 19. THE NEW BIRTH. BY ELDER J. H. DURLAND. IN time plan of salvation through Jesus Christ God is ever held before us as a being of love. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoso-ever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." john 3:16. He is not willing that any should perish. His wish is that all should live eternally. Satan, by his deceptions, not only insnared our first parents, but has been successful in bringing the human family into bondage. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3 : 23. Time great deceiver de-sires to keep all in his bonds, that he may at last cast them down to destruction, thus de.; feating the purpose of God. While God does not save man against his will, yet he has pro-vided everythiang that can be provided to show his mighty power to those who will be-lieve. "Behold what manner of love time Father bath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are." 1 John 3: 1, Revised Version. But when we speak of being children, the question arises, How can we, servants of Satan, become children of God? We enter life in this world by being born. Before this act of nature we were to ourselves as though we were not. The only way ordained by God for human beingS to come into time conscious possession of earthly life is by a birth. None since Adam ever came into an earthly life in any other way than that of being born. To everyone th us horn into this   world, his birth is, to him, time beginning of his existence. Every individual that enters the life in
