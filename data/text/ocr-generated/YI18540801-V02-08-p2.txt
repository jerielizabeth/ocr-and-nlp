Ah, surely she must carry it back; some happier blind girl might pluck the fruit from this tree of life, and find healing in its 411/  blessed leaves. And, holding the dear volume near to the beating of her heart, she knelt by her white cot to pray : " Dear and blessed Jesus, who loveat the poor and openest the eyes of the blind, I thank thee that thou hast not hid-den thyself from a poor blind girl. And since I cannot read thy heavenly words, I pray that thou wilt whisper them into my soul, that my spirit may not be dark like my poor eyes. I can see thee with my heart, dear Jesus, and thou knowest that I love thee and love thy holy book." And she touched the open Bible with her lips. 0 joy ! to the soft lips the slight indentations of the raised surface are clearly perceptible ; they trace the sharp outline, of the letters withŁ unerring accuracy. With a low cry of joy, she passes line after line across her eager lips, she turns the leaf, the lips lose not their power. It is all clear, all easy now. The lips could do what the toil-hardened fingers could notŠthey could read. A twelvemonth after, I visited Dijon. The low kitchen wore its old look, but what a beam-ing, happy face was Marie's, as she sat in her rude chair, her basket of straw at her feet, read-ing her beloved Bible. Blind, it was full of light. 0  ."N'est it pas heureux," she murmured in her rich, musical tones, "n'est it pas heureux de bailer ainsi les douces paroles pendant que je les lis ?" Is it not blessed to kiss the sweet words as I read? Dear eloquent lips, which the cold clay kiss-es now, told me this little tale, and I listened with startingstears, thinking how the poor blind girl would rise up in the judgment to condemn the many, who "having eyes, see not." Reader, do you love the blessed Nerds e- sus, with a love, heart-deep, heart- the poor blind girl of Burgundy A True Story1 ' Š . A SAILOR**  asked -what ind4ed him first to attend to *gum, and gave for his answer the following :Š " I came home from my last voyage before Christmas, and journeyed home. Being late when I arrived, I had not the opportunity of seeing my oldest girl, about six years of age, until the following day. At dinner time, when she sat down, I began (beast like) to eat what was before me, without ever thinking of my heavenly Father who pmvided daily bread; but glancing my eye war. is girl, of whom I was doatingTy fond, I o her to look at me with astonishment. - a mo- li ment's pause, she asked trss in a solemn and a serious manner, 'Fathi  er do you never ask a l N ice' Ł - -., blessing before eating t' Her mother observed me to look hard at her, and hold.  my knife and fork motionless; (it was not angerŠit was a rush of conviction which struck me like light-ning ;) apprehending some reproof from me, and wishing to pass it by in a trifling way, she said, Do you say grace, Nanny ?' My eyes were still riveted upon the child, for I felt conscious that I had never instructed her to pray. The child seeing me wait for her to begin, put her hands together, and lifting up her eyes to heav-en, breathed the sweetest prayer I ever heard. This was too much for me ; the knife and fork dropped from my hands, and I gave vent to my feelings in tears." Ł Here a pause ensued. On recovering himself, he continued : "I inquired who had thus instructed the child. The moth-er informed me, the good people at the chap-el next door; and the child Would never go to bed,.nor rise in the morning, without kneeling down to pray for herself and her dear father and mother. Ah ! thought I, and I never prayed for, myself or for my children. I enter-ed the chapel in the, evening, for the first time, and continued to attend the means of grace there. The Lord having awakend me to a sense of my danger, through the instrumentality of a dear child, I am now seeking him with all my heart, and truly can say, I am happy in the thought that Jew, Christ came into the world to save poor sinners of whom I am chief." I hope all the little children who read this, will imitate the sailor's daughter.Š Wesleyan. PERSEVERANCE. THE certainty of success in attaining the ob-ject designed in every undertaking, not only in our temporal matters, but" also in our spiritual welfare, depends very much upon perseverance, perhaps wholly. The plans and etforts of the farmer,. des man, or the scholar all prove futile a availing without perseverance. Ł So of the mariner who navigates the pathless ocean. He is often called to pass through winds and storms, and to meet a powerful and stronglyopposing tide, and to encounter the dangers sur-rou ding shoals and quick-sands, and many ot imminent perils from which he could nev- er e cape without perseverance. But cheered and encouraged with the hope of success in.the . enterprise before him, he presses on through all the perils to which he is exposed by day and by night, passing months and years, far away from home and friends dear to him. . But let us consider the importance of persever-ance in the service of our heavenly Master. Fat  without decision of character and energy of purpose in rendering obedience tip) com-mandments of God, and the requirements of the gospel, there will be a corresponding loss of happiness, and trust in Goth The duties con-
