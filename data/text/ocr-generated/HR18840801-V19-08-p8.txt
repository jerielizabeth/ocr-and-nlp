From the memoirs of the Royal Society of France, we find that Dr. Geoffry, an eminent French physician and professor of chemistry in the best of French educational institutions, has done this very thing, and made an exhaustive series of experiments to decide upon the relative proportion of nourishment in the two. We have no room here to publish the entire table, which he furnishes as the result of his labors, but an extract will serve our purpose. He finds the follow-ing nutriment inŠ Oz. Dr. Gr. 1 pound beef  0 7 8 1 pound veal  1 1 48 1 pound mutton  1 3 16 1 pound chicken  1 4 34 1 pound bread  4 1 0 which makes the relative values of one pound of beef, 7 ; veal, 9 ; chicken, 12 ; bread, 33. Taking these figures as a basis, our gro-cers might sell their flour at the rate of 75 cents per pound, and at the same time the buyers would pay no more for it, rel-atively, than they now pay for beef. The table shows that the nutritive element in bread is five times that in beef, by which we may at once see that one pound of flour is worth five pounds of beef. Putting the average price of beef at 15 cents per pound, we have our statements verified, 5 times 15 being 75. The extravagance of beef-eating is cer-tainly not popularly appreciated. " But we cannot live without meat!" cries the unthinking element of the world in a chorus. " The structure of man's body proves that he was meant to be a flesh-eating animal. His pointed canine teeth are evidences of this."  Baron Cuvier, perhaps the most emi-nent authority on comparative anatomy in the world, says in effect:Š " In his organs of digestion, man re-sembles no carnivorous animal. The structure of his frame is that of one fitted to purely vegetable diet in every essen- tial particular."  The monkey race and the herb-eating camel have canine teeth much more highly developed than they are in man, and who is willing to declare that the monkey or camel should eat meat in order to be vig-orous? After years of total abstinence from an-imal food of all kinds, Dr. W. A. Alcott, well known in New England, says:Š " I have no doubts of the vast impor-tance that would result to mankind from the universal and exclusive use of vegeta-ble food. I believe such a course would be the means of improving our race phys-ically, intellectually, and morally beyond anything of which the world has yet con-ceived." " Our proof," says Rousseau, " that the taste of meat is not natural to the human palate, is the indifference which children have for that kind of food, and the prefer-ence they give to vegetable aliments, such as milk, pastry, bread, fruits, etc." That animal food is eaten, and serves for the nourishment of the human species, proves nothing at all. Horses, sheep, and oxen are universally allowed to be her-bivorous animals; and yet there are in-stances of their learning to live upon flesh. The Norwegians feed fish to their domes-tic animals, and it is no uncommon sight in Norway to see a cow gnawing a bone like a dog. In his "History of the Earth," Goldsmith says: " The appetite of do-mestic animals may be changed, and those that feed only on grass may be rendered carnivorous. I have seen a sheep that would eat flesh, and a horse that was fond of oysters;" all of which goes to prove that the baker out-ranks his sanguinary brother as a producer of aliment, and should make our readers thoroughly alive to the value of wheat products.ŠThe Chi-cago Grocer. CARE FOR THE WHOLE MAN. TEMPERANCE reformers are sometimes apt to regard abstinence from drink the al-pha and omega of temperance. It is encour-aging to see, now and then, an evidence that at least a few of those engaged in this noble reformatory work are sufficiently broad in their ideas to grasp the whole truth, as well set forth by the following extract from a sermon by an English clergyman:Š " We hear much, in these days, of in-temperance ; but how are we to under-stand what intemperance means, if we do not study God's will as shown in our Gon-stitution ? I have no doubtŠnobody can doubtŠthltt intemperance in eating or drinking is a bad thing. What I wish, however, to point out, is that men may ruin their health and do themselves an injury in many other ways besides eating
