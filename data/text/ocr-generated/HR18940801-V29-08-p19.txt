Ł HOME CULTURE. 239 Luxurious homes mentally and morally asphyxiated for want of that atmosphere, just as the poor little ones in tenement houses suffer for want of good air to breathe. The result is to make them sickly in mind and body in the first case, as well as in the last." It would be folly to expect a child to be orderly in an atmosphere of disorder, or to love neatness and tidiness in a home where cleanliness is almost un-known. If parents hope to ingraft into the characters of their children, promptitude, orderliness, and simi-lar desirable qualities, they must surround them with the requisite environments,Š a place for everything, a time for every duty, and particularly the example of promptness, punctuality, and orderliness, in those of the household with whom they associate. Most of us are apt to acknowledge the education of environment for the child of older growth; but for the tiny babe, what its eyes dwell upon, what its ears hear, is too often accounted a matter of very small import. But this is not so. Before the child is a half-year old, the things that are happening around him, the things that his eyes see, the sounds that come to his ears, the cheeriness and harmony of his nursery environments, the soft lullaby his mother sings,Š are all making lasting impressions upon him. He is passively learning from his surroundings. The baby of the household should, above all other mem-bers, be surrounded with things lovely and pleasant. Quiet and order should reign in his nursery, which in location may best be the brightest, cheeriest, sun- niest room of the entire house. Let the whole at-mosphere of the nursery be one of gentleness and love. The atmosphere of the child's home life is a strong molding and educating influence. Dr. O.W. Holmes says he imbibed his love of literature from the atmosphere of books within his childhood's home. Many parents desiring an early religious experience for their children confuse and bewilder their minds by endeavoring to impart to them a knowledge of dogmas and creeds too weighty for their immature minds. Children are not likely to be made pious by repeating texts of Scripture, or by committing to memory catechisms and Sabbath-school Ł lessons. Seek rather to surround the little ones with an atmosphere of religion and genuine piety. Let them absorb religious ideas and feelings from the spiritual atmosphere of their every-day home life, just as they absorb the life-giving oxygen from the air they breathe ; and the germs of spiritual life which are within them may be quickened into life as the seed within the ground is developed and begins to grow when the right conditions of warmth and moisture are supplied. Parents must study their children. The early months and years are the most critical period of existence. The plastic mind in this period readily receives the mold of environment. The little germs of character which are within the child, ready for development, are like tiny plantlets just peeping their heads above the earth, and are as easily destroyed or dwarfed by unfavorable conditions. WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN ? 4 A LADY who was recently visiting some friends in a certain large town was surprised at the way in which the children of the family were treated. They were bright and interesting children, a boy of thirteen and a girl of eleven, and, naturally, very dear to their father and mother. The former was a professional man with large interests ; the latter was an intelligent woman, not wholly given to society, though fond of it, and a good judge of literature and art. A day or two after the lady's arrival, she observed that, though the children were usually present at meals, they were conspicuously absent between them. " Where are the children ?" she asked of the mother. " I'm sure I don't know," answered that indi-vidual brightly. " Aren't they about somewhere ?" " I have n't seen them since I have been here, ex-cepting at meals," returned her friend. " They were  at breakfast this morning, but it is now after eleven; and if 'they are in the house, they are keeping very still." " 0, I 've no .idea that they are in the house," returned the mother, laughing. "You would know it soon enough if they were, I can assure you. They are probably off visiting among their schoolfellows. Mollie spends a great deal of time with a little friend in the next street. Perhaps she has gone to the park with her doll, it is so pleasant. She is safe, and will be back to luncheon, never fear ! " "But aren't you afraid they will get into mischief, wandering off in this irresponsible way ? " " My dear ! " the mother responded with some spirit, "do you imagine that children brought up among such associations as mine have been, could stray away from what is right ? I trust my child-ren."
