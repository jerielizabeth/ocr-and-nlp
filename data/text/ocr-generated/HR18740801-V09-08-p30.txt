Remove to a safe distance every particle of waste from the table, slops or garbage from the kitchen, and any other matter which is capable of under-going decomposition. Never leave matters of this nature to accumulate in vaults and cess-pools. They are deadly agents of destruction. Pig-sties and compost heaps should never be tolerated with-in smelling distance of any human habitation. 2. In cases where it is found impossible to pre-vent the slight accumulation of some kind of offen-sive matter, as excrement, disinfectants should be so constantly employed as to prevent any offensive odor. By a disinfectant is not meant something which will simply obscure the odor by a stronger one. A proper disinfectant is a substance which will either absorb and retain the offensive materi-al, or effectually destroy it. The very best of all disinfectants is dry earth. Finely pulverized clay is the best, but almost any fine, dry earth is effi-cient. It should be thoroughly dried, and should be often and generously applied. Of course, the cost is insignificant. Solutions of permanganate of potash and of copperas are also excellent disin-fectants to be applied to vessels requiring cleans-ing, or under other circumstances in which dry earth cannot be conveniently used. A little of either of these solutions will often quickly remove all unpleasant odor from an odoriferous drain pipe. Something about Cisterns. SEVERAL have asked, " What shall I do for my cistern ? The water is so offensive as to be almost intolerable." Cisterns often become a source of disease. They are usually situated under the house, where not a ray of sunlight can get into them, even ever so rarely. This alone would be sufficient to render them foul and offensive, as sunlight is one of the most powerful disinfectants. In addition to this, cisterns are often so loosely inclosed at the top that worms, rats, and other small animals fall into them and die, thus vitiat-ing and contaminating the water, and rendering some cisterns little better than stagnant, fuming pools of liquid corruption. When cisterns become thus foul, they should be cleansed without delay. The present month is a good time to give them a thorough purification so that they may be filled with pure water by the fall rains. Sometimes a cistern becomes offensive from the decomposition of the organic matter washed from the roof and brought down from the air. When the amount of impurity is not excessive, such water can be purified and deodorized by a very simple process. Take a bushel of freshly-burned char-coal, pulverize a portion of it, or mix with it a small quantity of animal charcoal. Place the whole in a bag, and suspend it in the cistern. If the water is not purified in a few days, renew the coal by ignition, or replace it by fresh charcoal, replacing the bag in the water. Gentle agitation, occasionally, will facilitate the purification. git trarg ot PROPER DIET FOR MAN. Battle Creek, Mich.:. HEALTH REFORMER Office. 48 pp. Price 15c.

The May number was received too late for notice in the July REFORMER. This journal seems to be making very earnest efforts to establish itself upon a solid basis. It is. not devoid of merits, but we must confess our regret at being obliged to regard it as one of the-hundreds of periodicals at present in circulation which seem to have no especial aim, without it be. to obtain a rank among the floating literature of the day. What the present age needs is earnest, workŠwork in behalf of humanity. We want papers and magazines which point out the sins. and follies of fashionable life ; which call the at-tention of people to wrong habits ; which show the absurdity of bestowing the whole attention upon the moral and intellectual natures while the physical wants of the individual are wholly neg-lected. The advent of every new journal of this sort is hailed with delight ; and we are heartily sorry that we cannot offer such a welcome to the journal before us. Nevertheless, it is equal in merit to many of the journals of miscellaneous reading which come to us for notice, is neatly printed, and with a little more promptness will doubtless secure a fair patronage.
