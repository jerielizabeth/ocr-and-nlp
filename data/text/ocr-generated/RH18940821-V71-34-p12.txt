We have just presented the Sabbath evidences in contrast with the supposed evidences for Sunday sacredness. A few were deeply moved. Two remained after the services to acknowledge the truth. We asked them to take God's word as a guide, and reject statements made in contra-diction therewith. We have found others who have just moved into town who are reading the REVIEW, and who seem to be earnestly seeking the light. Breth-ren and sisters, remember us in your prayers. Aug. 7. F. B. JOHNSON, M. LEATHERMAN. WISCONSIN. BLoomvieeE.ŠJuly 5 we commenced holding meetings in a school-house and in a Presby-terian chapel. A good interest was developed. As the result of the work done here, twenty-seven have taken a stand for the truth. Sunday, Aug. 5, Elder I. Sanborn baptized twenty will-ing souls. There were three keeping the Sab-bath when we came here, and three who had given it up have begun its observance again. We are of good courage in the Lord, and ask to be remembered at the throne of grace. Aug. 9. SWIN SWINSON, ENOS MO INTOSH. RICHLAND CENTER.Š By recommendation of the Conference, we opened tent-meetings here June 29. We found the people willing to listen, and the attendance excellent. The audiences were especially large while the Sabbath question was under discussion. Eight souls have decided to obey. There are others whose deep interest and remarks lead us to believe they will accept the light of present truth. The population of this place is about 2000. The people have treated us with respect, and their donations have been quite liberal. J. N. ANDERSON, B. G. WILKENSON, F. W. PHELPS. SOUTH DAKOTA. BRrrroN.Š After the camp-meeting at Madi-son, brethren Berg, Carmichael, Jensen, and the writer began work in this vicinity among the Scandinavians and English. At first we held evening meetings during .the week, but these we had to close on account of the busy time in the harvest, which came on so suddenly because of the hot winds and the dry weather. People worked early and late, and quite a number worked Sundays, too. On Sundays we have held from three to four meetings in different places. Other days we have visited the people, and distributed reading-matter. Several hundred pages of tracts have been sold and given away. Quite a number acknowledge that the truth has been presented to them, and some are beginning to walk in the truth. We expect soon to begin some evening meetings again. Notwithstanding the dry season, there is a fair crop over a large tract of country in this part of the State ; then, again, there are some places even here where the grain will not be harvested, because it will not pay to cut it. H. R. JOHNSON. IOWA, WE pitched our tent in the country about six miles from Milford, and commenced meetings June 14, intending to continue only ten days ; but at the end of that time our tent was crowded with people, and we concluded to stay longer. A Methodist minister has preached three dis- courses in our tent against our work. He led out on all the controverted points, giving us an opportunity to bring the truth before the people. The truth is steadily gaining ground, and we hope to see a goodly company brought out of darkness into the light of the gospel of the Son of God. Since coming among this people, thirteen have been baptized, and eight or nine others are keep-ing the Sabbath, some of whom have asked for baptism. Notwithstanding the bitter opposition, to-gether with the drouth, the latter being the worst that this State has ever known, we have most of the money raised, and a part of the material on the ground, with which to build a church. We hope by the help of God to establish the truth firmly in this place. Our temporal wants have been liberally supplied by donations. Our book sales have amounted to ,13. Aug.' 9. G. F. WATSON, N. L. Mo CLINTOCK, N. C. BERGERSON. TENNESSEE RIVER CONFERENCE. WE are doing more work and seeing more interest in the different parts of the Conference than ever before. Especial attention has been given to the people of Weakley county, where brother Capps is lying in jail. Brother Reavis did faithful service in laying the plans for the work in this county. He was then called to Atlanta, Ga., to attend to important work there. Elder G. Garrett was called to take the work so favorably started by brother Reavis, assisted by volunteers of both brethren and sisters. Good reports are coming in from the work there. One member of the grand jury that indicted brother Capps has, with his wife, begun to keep the Sabbath. Brother Capps's brother has been to see him several times, and he sees that this is a work of persecution. Brother Capps is faithful and of good courage, and willing to lie in jail while he can best serve the Lord and advance his cause there. Brother H. W. Reed and the writer are con-duCting a second series of meetings in the city of Nashville. The attendance is. good, ranging from 100 to 180. A general interest is awakened through the city upon the themes discussed. Seven adults have recently united with the church here. We hope that the soon-coming camp-meeting will be a help to the people. CHAS. L. BOYD. PENNSYLVANIA CONFERENCE. ImmEntivruLv after our State camp-meeting, held at Corry, our laborers were assigned fields as follows : Elder W. H. Miller and brother L. S. Wheeler were assigned to Chester, a city of considerable importance about fifteen miles be-low Philadelphia, and Elder K. C. Russell and brother Charles Baierle, to Columbia, a city be-tween Harrisburg and Philadelphia ; but as an opening did not appear at once, it was decided that they locate their tent in Altoona. Elder M. D. Mattson stopped for a few weeks at Geneva, a small town southwest of Meadville, where an interest existed among a company of First-day Adventists, and then removed to Eldred, Mc Kean county, a thriving village near the scene of his labors last summer. Brethren J. M. Kutz and A. S. Bowersox pitched their tent in Millbach. Brethren Loughhead and Smith were advised to work in Tioga county, in localities where an interest seemed to demand it, using halls or school-houses for a place of meeting. For the Bible-reading work, we have brother Geo. W. Spies in Philadelphia, and sister Lizzie Culveyhouse in Erie. Brother and sister Hum-phrey are also in Erie, devoting much of their  time to the same work, but are not as yet in the employ of the Conference. Brethren Champlin and Rees remained in Corry to follow up the in-terest after camp-meeting, by colportage, sustain-ing themselves in the same. Elder J. L. Baker was left free to visit the companies he raised up last fall and winter, and get them in proper condition for organization. Brother Hibbard and myself are to labor among the churches and unorganized companies. We have organized four churches since camp-meeting : One at Bradford, consisting of nine-teen members, to which three have since been added, making a membership of twenty-two. Others are expected to join soon. One at Indian Creek, three miles from Eldred, where brethren Mattson and W. W. Williams are located. Twenty-five united on the day of organization, and some five more are ready, whom circumstances prevented from being present on the day of organization. This church is mostly made up of persons who never made a profession before, some of them being professed infidels before the message found them ; and not one in the organi-zation was a member of another church when the brethren began meetings there last fall. In May a noted opposer was called to this place to tear down the work, and when he made the statement that Adventists never were the means of con-verting any one, but that they were simply proselyters, those people knew better. The other two churches organized were at Harrisburg and Lebanon, the former consisting of eleven mem-bers, and the latter of twenty-one. We have four more companies almost ready for organization, at the following places ; Cob-ham, Warren Co., Butler, Butler Co., Waynes-bury, Greene Co., and at Oakland. Each tent company reports a good interest and a hopeful outlook for the future. At Lowville, Erie Co., brother Hibbard reports an excellent quarterly meeting, and the addition of ten mem-bers, making the present membership twenty-four. Some six more will unite, it is hoped, in the near future. Brother Mattson reports seven .new converts at Geneva, who, added to those who were there, will make a company of eleven. Brother Lough-head reports seven accessions where he and brother Smith are at work. Assuredly the Lord has gone out before us. Brethren and sisters, let us praise his holy name, and take courage. I. N. WILLIAMS. OUR CENTRAL PUBLISHING HOUSE. THERE are thousands of our readers who have never seen the REVIEW Office, and have but a dim idea of its work, methods, or what it is accom-plishing. Perhaps a brief description would be of interest to such. There are at present in the Central Office about 215 employees, a less'number than has been em-ployed in the few years just past, owing to the present financial depression. The institution is divided into several depart-ments, contained in two buildings separated by Washington St. The west building contains the managers' offices, sales-room, and counting-room. Here the general accounts are kept. Connected with the sales department are the packing- and storage-rooms, which are sufficiently large to con-tain and care for thousands of volumes. In this building are also contained the offices of the sub-scription department of the REVIEW and In-structor, besides many offices devoted to the use of the General Conference and its various' de-partments. Ł In the east building the work of manufacturing is carried on. The floor space of this building, containing over 50,000 square feet, is divided into the following departments : Superintendent's of-fice, editorial offices, engraving department, book and periodical composing rooms, job-room, press-
