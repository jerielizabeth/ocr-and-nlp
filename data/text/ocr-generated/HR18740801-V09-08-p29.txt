THE HEALTH REFORMER. 253 SEASONABLE HINTS! Dysentery. THIS is the season of the year when dysentery and other bowel complaints begin to be most fre-quent. Perhaps none of them are more painful than the one mentioned. It is not, however, nec-essarily a very dangerous disease. A majority of sufferers from it recover, even under drug treat-ment ; and under proper hygienic treatment, even the most difficult cases are seldom lost, although drug physicians lose a very large proportion of the more severe cases. The disease often begins like ordinary diarrhea, many times with chills and subsequent fever. Griping pains in the abdomen, with great tender-ness, frequent inclination to go to stool, with scanty discharges of hardened feces, together with blood and mucus, either mingled or unmixed, are the prominent symptoms. Dysentery is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the large intestine, which soon ex-tends to the other portions of the intestinal canal when it is not speedily checked. Treatment. Only the general principles can be indicated. There being a strong determination of blood to the central organs, the effort must be to regulate the superficial circulation. Keep the head cool and the feet warm. The patient should remain very quiet, and the abdomen should be constantly covered with a cool compress which may be occasionally replaced by a hot fomentation for a few minutes. During the febrile stage, keep the surface cool by tepid or cool sponging, or by frequent packs. Great abstemiousness, if not total abstinence from food, should be maintained during the two or three days of the febrile stage≈†it does not usually last longer than that under water treat-ment. The patient will have little appetite, and should not be urged to eat. After the fever has decidedly diminished, small quantities of the very simplest food can be taken. Gruels, baked ripe apples, and blackberries, are excellent foods for adults. Infants should receive their natural food from a natural and healthy source. Death in the Well. DEATH comes in a great variety of forms, and obtrudes upon us his unwelcome visits in numer-ous ways ; now appearing in a " damp bed-room," now in " the pot," and now in " the sirup jug." But few suspect his appearance in the well ; yet the cool and sparkling water from many hundreds of wells, in both city and country, are contami-nated with death, impregnated with disease. Nu-merous instances have occurred in which the ori-gin of typhoid fever could be traced directly to  the use of well water which was tainted and poi-soned with the products of organic decomposition. A well situated near a barnyard or vault is sure to be contaminated by the drainage from such sources, the filtration through the soil being in-sufficient to cleanse away the pollution. Even wells which were half a mile from a neighboring cemetery have been thoroughly poisoned by the percolation through the earth of water which held in solution decayed animal matters from the cem-etery. The water of wells sometimes becomes almost putrescent from the presence of worms, frogs, or other small animals, which have entered from above. Such water should never be used. When a well becomes thus affected, it should be thor-oughly cleansed at once. Never use without fil-tering or boiling, water in which dead worms or frogs are found. A well should be thoroughly cleansed at least twice each year. An excellent way to exclude worms is to dig a trench about the top and fill it with ashes. When new wooden pumps are placed in wells, the water often acquires a bad taste from the de-composition of the wood of the pump. This is not only unpalatable, but unhealthful ; it can be readily remedied by throwing into the well a few handfuls of pounded charcoal which has been re-cently burned. After the charcoal has been al-lowed to settle, the water will be sweet and clear. Examine the Premises. Duar&a the present hot weather, the most care-ful scrutiny should be bestowed upon all of the surroundings of every dwelling, to make sure that you are not living in the midst of disease-produc-ing influences of the most potent character. Com-post heaps, reeking swill barrels, neglected out-houses, drains, sinks, cisterns, and cellars may be the concealed sources of sickness and death to one after another of the members of an unsuspecting household. Summer complaints, diarrhea, dys-entery, and kindred diseases find in the emana-tions from decaying organic matters their most common cause. So also with Asiatic cholera and yellow fever ; although they may be communi-cated by a specific poison, yet it is well known that cholera and other dangerous epidemics never flourished except where sanitary regulations are disregarded. Fever and ague, typhoid, and other fevers, are also directly due to the inhalation of disorganizing or vegetable matter. Noxious gases may usually be detected by the organs of smell ; but sometimes the olfactory nerve becomes so accustomed to the presence of foul odors that it ceases to recognize them as such, and then no warning of danger is given. But the important problem is to know how to avoid these productive sources of disease. Cleanliness and dis'nfection are the only remedies. To prevent
