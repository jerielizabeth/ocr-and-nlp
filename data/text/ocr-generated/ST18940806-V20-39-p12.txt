LORD, for to-morrow and its needs I do not pray; Keep me, my God, from stain of sin Just for to-day. Let me both diligently work And duly pray; Let me be kind in word and deed Just for to-day. .Let me be slow to do my will, Prompt to obey; Help me to sacrifice myself Just for to-day. Let me no wrong or idle word Unthinking say; Set thou a seal upon my lips Just for to-day. So for to-morrow and its needs I do not pray; But keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord, Just for to-day. ŠSelected. CONSEQUENCES OF HOLDING ON TO RICHES. IN his word the Lord has plainly revealed his will to those who have riches. But be-cause his direct commands have been slighted, he mercifully presents their dangers before them through the Testimonies. He does not give new light, but calls their attention to the light that has already been revealed in his word. If those who profess to love the truth are holding on to their riches, and, failing to obey the word of God, do not seek opportu-nities to do good with that which he has in-trusted to them, he will come closer, and- will scatter their means. He will come near to theM-  with judgments. He will Ł in various ways scatter their idols. Many losses will be sustained. The souls of the selfish shall 'be unblest. But "the liberal soul shall be made fat." Those who honor God he will honor. The Lord made a covenant with Israel that, if they would obey his commandments, he would give them rain in due season, the land Should yield her increase, and the trees of the field should yield their fruit. He prom-ised that their threshing should reach unto the vintage, and the vintage unto the sowing time, and that they should eat their bread to the full, and dwell in their land .safely. He would make their enemies to perish. He would not abhor them,-but would walk with them, and would be their God, and they should be his people. But if they disre-garded his requirements, he would deal with them entirely contrary to all this. His curse should rest upon them, in place of his bless-ing. He would break their pride-of power, and would make the heavens over them as iron, and the earth as brass. "Your strength shall be spent in vain ; for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. And if ye-walk contrary unto me," "then will I also walk Contrary unto you." Those who are selfishly withholding their means need not be surprised if God's hand Scatters. That which should have been de-voted to the advancement of the 'work and cause of God, but which has been withheld, May be intrusted to a reckless son, and he may squander it. A fine horse, the pride of a vain heart, may be found dead in the stable. Occasionally a cow may die. Losses of fruit or other crops may come. God can scatter the means he has lent to his stewards, if they  refuse to use it to his glory. Some may have none of these losses to remind them of their remissness in duty, but their cases may be the more hopeless.ŠTestimony for the Church No. 20. Ł HOW TO HAVE GOD'S HELP. "AND when Elisha was come, . . . he went ill therefore, and shut the door;  . and prayed unto the Lord." 2 Kings 4 : 32, 33. All life-giving power comes from God, and the prophet knew this. All of his de-pendence just then was in time Lord God om-nipotent. Centuries later Jesus taught his disciples to always shut the door the -first thing, when they would talk with God, and he also taught them, by precept and example, that the next thing to do after they-had prayed was to do all they could to help an-swer the prayer they had made, and this was the very thing the prophet did. One eason why some of us do not have more prayers answered is because we stop praying as soon as we come out of our closets. The right kind of a prayer never stops. We forget that sometimes the most effective pray-ing is done with hands and feet and brain and pocketbook. We say, "Amen," and quit, just when we ought to press on with more earnestness, or we stay on our knees asking for bread when we ought to be out in time field doing something withŁa hoe. God help us to pray in a way that angels can under-stand, no matter whether they hear our words or not. "If I had as much wheat in a barn as you've got, papa, I'd answer that prayer myself," said a little boy to the stingy father, who had prayed at the family altar for a man who needed bread: That boy had a true idea of prayer that some old men never get.ŠRam's Horn. -Ł FROM SOUTH AMERICA. THE Union Record, of New York City, pub-lishes a private letter from Brother R. B. Craig, dated 'Buenos Ayres, May 11, from which we take the following extracts:Š Yes, the Revolution did interfere with the work in Brazil, or at least it seemed so to us. Yet we know that all things work together for good to them that love the Lord. It is in the past now, and Brother Stauffer is pushing the work there with in-creased help from some who have commenced to keep the Sabbath. I wish someone was here to take charge of the business matters, which are increasing all the time, and this would leave me free to give my time wholly to canvassing. I am now getting "Patriarchs and Prophets" in some of the best English families in Buenos Ayres; but I only get two or three days a week to canvass. The brethren are doing fairly well on the Spanish books, but it is still a problem to be solved how to get the books into the homes of many of the Catholic people. Brother Brooking is having some success in this direction, and our prayers con-stantly ascend that the Lord will direct in our efforts to reach them. Brother Nowlen is now at Sandy Point, Straits of Magellan. The prospects are not now so favorable there as on the islands, but he is pushing things, and we hope to see some respond to the light he leaves there. My wife -is teaching school with a few English children, and we spend an hour or more each even-ing studying Spanish with two other families, one of which is Spanish, and while they teach us Span-ish we teach them English. The climate here is good in many respects, yet there is much suffering from rheumatism, and from time very bad meat, which is eaten in large quantities by almost every family. We are very anxious to hear from the General Conference Council. We are expecting a reenforce-meat by some ministerial help. Certainly the peo-ple of this country should have the privilege of hearing the message publicly soon. Exchange is very bad here now, as it takes $3.90 in this currency to buy one dollar of United States money. But the currency is like many other things  hereŠit is rotten beyond repair. If anyOne wants to see what Catholicism will do fOr a country, just let him see things in these South American countries. Still it is better now than a few years past, when Romanism held full sway. We are all of good courage in the Master's work, and are doing all we can to push it forward.  Ł 1 IF God pronounces a woe upon those who are called to preach the truth and refuse to obey, a heavier woe rests upon those who take upon them this sacred work without clean hands and pure hearts. As there are woes ,for those who preach the truth while they are unsanctified in heart and life, so there are woes for 'those who receive and maintain the unsanctified in the position which they cannot fill.ŠGospel Workers. FIELD NOTES. NOTES. AT Oraville, Ill., Elder H. W. Decker re-ports that five adults have taken a decided stand for the truth. Ł ON the 8th ult. there were three additions to the church at Washington, D. C., making nineteen in the past eight months. AT Albany, N. Y., Elder A. E. Place re-cently baptized four persons, having the free use of the Memorial Baptist Church. Ł ELDER L. D. SANTEE reports a good interest in meetings at Gibson City, Ill., the attend-ance being 150 each evening, and 500 on Sunday evening. Ł THREE Bible workers are now laboring in Spokane, Wash., in connection with the tent work. They are: Mrs. E. G. Fulton (formerly of the SIGNS office), Miss M. Bessie De Graw, and Miss Evelyn M. Riley. ELDER W. D. CURTIS recently began Ł tent meetings at Malta, and on the third even- ing the two resident ministers and their con-gregations, numbering about three hundred, _were present to hear for themselves. AT Taftsville, Vt., two persons were recently baptized by Elder Wm. Covert. He expects soon to organize the company of Sabbath keepers at that place. He also reports time baptism of four at South Londonderry. OF the camp meeting at Jamestown, N. Dakota, Elder N. W. Allee reports an encamp-ment of nearly two hundred persons, about one-half of whom were Germans. Services were conducted in the English, German, and Swedish languages, and twenty-three were baptized. IN connection with the last quarterly meet-ing in the Scandinavian Church of Brooklyn, N. Y., four persons were baptized, making nine additions for the quarter. One other candidate for baptism was prevented by sick-ness. Meetings are held at 281 Sackett Street. Sabbath school at 10 A. M., and preaching at 11. ELDER J. W. COLLIE reports eleven converts in Tampa, Fla., as a result of tent meetings held in that place, with a good interest con-tinuing. The brethren there have purchased a house of worship formerly owned by the Presbyterians. However, time work there is carried forward amid time bitter opposition of time enemy. THE leaders of a mob who some weeks ago attempted to pull down and hum a Seventh-day Adventist tent at Bushy Creek, S. C., were arrested by the citizens of time place, who ha.d prevented the outrage. About the time the matter was to be heard in court, the men asked pardon and desired to have the charges withdrawn. At the solicitation of our breth-ren, the case was dismissed,-and time accused parties entered into bonds to keep time peace. Elders J. 0. Johnson and E. W. Webster have charge of the tent work at Bushy Creek.
