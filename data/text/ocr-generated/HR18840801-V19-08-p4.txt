22R FOOD mik;Ari/r1-11. evidence for the infectious nature of con-sumption is singularly complete. " In 119 cases the disease is recorded as having been transmitted from husband to wife, and in 69 from wife to husband ; while in 130 of these cases, it is stated, there was no family tendency to the dis-ease in the partner to whom the disease was conveyed. In 32 cases there was in-fection between brothers and sisters, and vice versa. What, however, are we to think of strange cases, such as the follow-ing? A servant nurses her master and mistress ; the former contracting con-sumption from his wife, and the servant dying in turn of the disease. A dress-maker, aged 48, ' living in rather a lonely cottage,' had three girls, apprentices, not related to one another. These girls resided in turn, for a week at a time, with the mis-tress, occupying the same bed as the lat-ter. During their apprenticeship, the mistress died of consumption; and, in less than two years afterward, all three appren-tices died of consumption. There was no tendency to the disease in the history of any of the girls. A healthy servant girl, aged 19, slept for several months with a fellow-servant. The latter left her situa-tion on developing consumptive symp-toms ; and the healthy girl ultimately de-veloped consumption, and died of the dis-ease, no other member of her family hav-ing been affected before or since. A child, having an absolutely healthy family his-tory, was nursed by a consumptive serv-snt. The child contracted the disease, which, as might be expected, ran a rapid course, and ended fatally. " It is needless to prolong the list of Such cases, which, in their plain, unvar-nished statement of facts, taken along with the scientific history of the disease, -supply a clearly affirmative answer to the question which heads this article. That which is of supreme importance, as a prac-tical deduction from the latest facts of science, is the health knowledge we ac-quire from a study of consumption and its history. We may sum up our health-max-ims concerning consumption as follows:Š " 1. In any case of chest-trouble of con-sumptive nature, it is highly improper for the patient to occupy the same room with another person. " 2. This holds especially true of the case of the young, who should be carefully supervised in their relations to possible sources of danger from nurses and others. "3. The ventilation (and disinfection) of the rooms occupied by consumptives should be continually practiced. The dis-infection of all matters brought up from the lungs should also be thoroughly car-ried out. "4. The high importance of maintain-ing the general health is also indicated ; for it may be laid down as a general rale that consumption (and all other diseases, in fact) is more likely to attack us when our health is below par, than when we are in good health. A low condition of the gen-eral health is, in fact, the borderland lead-ing to many diseases." THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEMORY. BY DR. ANDREW WILSON. NATURALLY enough, the topic of memo-ry-improvement forms the end and focus of all thoughts, reflections, and considera-tions regarding the recollective powers. Of all complaints of body and mind, that of a " bad memory " is perhaps the most commonly bewailed. The only surprising part of the practice in question appears to consist in the fact that, despite the avowal that the memory is deficient in exactitude, there is often illustrated an utter carelessness respecting its improve-ment. This indisposition to better the memory powers arises, I believe, chiefly from the idea that the recollective powers are little, if at all, susceptible of cultivation, education, or improvement. People, as a rule, are content to jog on in their accus-tomed way, feeling their memory defi-ciences acutely, and regretting their ina-bility to " remember " the details of busi-ness or life at large ; but, at the same time, making no effort whatever to bestir themselves in the matter of improvement. The idea that a bad memory " comes by nature," and is insusceptible of improve-ment, has become fixed in the minds of the majority of persons. Until this ex-ceedingly false notion is removed, and replaced by the true idea,Šnamely, that, under ordinary circumstances, the mem-ory may be wonderfully improved and cultivated,Šmental progress will be re-tarded, and intellectual growth fail to reach even a moderate degree of possible devel-opment. One of the points most necessary of rec-ognition and remembrance in connection with the memory and its culture, is that which insists on the mutual interdepen-dence of memory upon the bodily state
