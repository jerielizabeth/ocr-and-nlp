8 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. After I had felt a hand laid on my forehead five or six ti noes, I suddenly reached forth to see if I could clutch it. I caught hold of an object resembling the wrist of a person. As soon as I had fairly clasped it, I was drawn from my chair across the room, for eight or ten feet. Meanwhile I Was holding on with all my strength, and the object which I held on to was making much effort apparently, by wring-ing or twisting the arm and hand, to release itself from my persistent grasp. When it touched my forehead, I could dis-tinctly feel the fingers, and even the very nails, upon them The hand felt to be smoother and far less moist than the hu-man hand; in fact, no Parian marble could be polished to such perfect smoothness. I also held a closed fan np as high as I could reach, and it was taken from me, though no person was within several feet of me at the time, and I was fanned for nearly a minute, and so were the others in the circle, each in turn. I request-ed the invisible intelligence to stop the ticking of a clock which stood on the mantle-shelf in the room. It was an iron clock, with enameled front, and it at once commenced tick-ing as rapidly again as it did. ordinarily ; it then commenced ticking slower and slower, till it almost entirely stopped. My shoe was taken off my right foot and thrown across the room, and the bottom of my foot was tickled excessively. My porte-monnaie was taken from my pocket, the bank-notes re-moved from it, and laid around on the heads of the mem-bers of the circle. They were soon replaced from whence they were taken, and the porte-monnsie returned to me. In-deed, it was slipped back into the pocket of my pants, oppo-site to the one out of which it was at first removed, it being the farthest off from those who were sitting with me in the circle. It was written out, without even the medium touch-ing the pencil, " Wealth does not make the man :" "The mind is the true standard of the man"Šwhich seemed as re-flections strikingly apposite to the demonstrations just given. I could fill many pages with similar facts which have oc-curred during my investigations, and some of them, far more remarkable than these, because perhaps, more personal in their bearing. FOREIGN NEWS. THE WAR. No change had occurred in the state of Eastern affairs, and none was likely to occur until after further consideration by the French and English Governments of the recent conduct of Austria. The Paris correspondent of The London Morning Chroni-cle makes the following important communication, lie says the Cabinets of Vienna and Berlin have communicated to the English and French Governments the impression produced upon them by the answer of the Emperor Nicholas to the summons sent him by Austria to evacuate the Principalities. The German powers now announce that in their opinion the propositions contained in the Russian answer, if net altogether satisfactory, appear to them calculated to serve as a basis for further negotiation ; and they propose that Prague shall be fixed upon as the seat of future conferences They moreover expressed an opinion that it will not be possible to call upon Russia to evacuate the Principalities, if it be not at the same time clearly understood that the allied powers shall stop their movements in advance. In other words, Austria has fallen back into an alliance with Russia. All the Austrian reserves are to be called out and placed on a war footing. Accounts from St. Petersburg state that the Czar is deter-mined not to yield; but discontent prevailed in the Capital. The details received show that the recent victory at Giur-gevb was achieved by the Turks unassisted, leaving the whole bank of the Danube from Turnn to Oltenitza in their hands. The main body of the Turkish Army is said to be moving to-wards the mouth of the Danube. None of the Anglo-French troops have yet been in action. The allies have repaired and occupied the Russian batter-ies at the Sulina mouth of the Danube, and are employed in removing sunken ships from the channel. The Russian Danube flotilla must soon fall into the hands of the allies. Free navigation of the Danube is again re-es-tablished. English seamen from the fleet have been sent to man the Turki-h boats on the Danube, with the intention of capturing the Russian river flotilla. The Russians have burned Mat-zhia. Gen. Aurep, having been disgraced from rank for want of success, shot himself. French troops from Adrianople are marching toward Var-na. The British are in camp at Devana. The French and English are slowly drawing their lines closer around the Rus-sians. Omer Pasha had reviewed the Anglo-French troops. SPAIN.ŠThe news is very important. The insurrection was spreading rapidly. By telegraph from Bayonne, the 20th, it is stated that Madrid and its garrison have pronounced against the Queen. The Cabinet is dissolved, and San Luis, the Pre-mier, has fled. Narvaez had offered to form a new Ministry. Espartero had placed himself at the head of the insurgents, and was marching on Madrid with the center division, while Gen. Zabuna advances with a force from the Basque provin-ces Victoria, Barges, Valadolid, Grenada, Saragossa, Zara-gone, Pampaluna, Barcelona, San Sebastian, and several smaller citŁs, also the Balearic Islands, have declared for the insurgents. Saragossa is expected to join the revolt. The insurrection hitherto has been mostly military, but the citizens were joining it. The watchwords are: "Viva le Constitution." " Down with the Ministry." " Down with Queen Christiana." Carlist guerilla bands have appeared in Catalonia. Ru-mors were current that Queen Christiana had fled to Bayon-ne, and that Queen Isabella had left Madrid ; also that the Duke of Montpensier had been declared Lieutenant-General of the kingdom; but all these rumors were considered doubt-ful. liens. Concha and Gonzales Bravo have arrived in Eng-land. Manuel Concha has escaped from the Canary Islands. Gen. Mazzerabo has fled to France. The insurgents if successful may offer the throne to Don Pedro of Portugal. The French Government is said to favor the insurrection. An aide-de-camp of the King cf Portugal is understood to have sought an interview with Napoleon to consult him on the subject. Napoleon replied that he could not enter into the project, but did not say he would interfere to prevent it. It is sur-mised that Russia is implicated in the insurrection, with a view of distracting the attention of France and England GREAT BRITAIN.ŠIn the House of Commons, Lord John Russell stated that the Queen would send in a message on the 24th inst., demanding an extra vote of credit for £3,000,000 sterling for the general purposes of the war.

Ix writing to this Office, let everything of a business na tare be put on a part of the sheet by itself, or on a separate sheet, so as not to be mixed up with other matters. 2. Be careful to write all names of persons and places, plainly and. distinctly. 3. In all oases give the name of the Post Office, County and State. When a Town or Village is called by one name, and the Post Office by another, be sure to give the name of the Post Office 4. When the direction of a paper is to be changed, do not forget to mention the Office to which it has been sent. 5 Let everything be stated explicitly, and in as few words as will express the writer's messing. 6. In writing texts of scripture, be sure to copy from the Bible correctly. It is no small sin to carelessly mangle the Word of God as some do.
