THE MASTER'S TOUCH. " HE touched her hand, and the fever left.her." 0 blessed touch of the Man divine! So beautiful to arise and serve him When the fever is gone from your life and mine. It may be the fever of restless serving, With the heart all thirsty for love and praise, - And eyes all aching and strained with yearning Toward self-set goals in the future days; Or it may be a fever of spirit anguish, Some tempest of sorrow that dies not down, Till the cross at last is in meekness lifted, And the head stoops low for the thorny crown; Or it may be a fever of pain and anger, When the wounded spirit is hard to bear, And only the Lord can draw forth the arrows Left carelessly, cruelly, rankling there. Whatever the fever, His touch can heal it; Whatever the tempest, his voice can still. There is only joy as we seek his pleasure; There is only a rest as we choose his will. And some clay, after life's fitful fever, I think we shall say, in the home on high, If the hands that he touched but did his bidding, How little it matters what else went by !" Ah, Lord ! Thou knowest us altogether, Each heart's sore sickness, whatever it be; Touch thou our hands ! Let the fever leave us, And so shall we minister unto thee ! Š London Christian. Ill) ur foniribnion. "Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remem-brance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name."ŠMal. 3:16, WE' SHALL REAP AS WE SOW. BY MRS. E. G. WHITE. IN company with my son, F. C. White, I rode in our carriage to Sydney, a distance of twelve miles. We could have taken the cars at the station in Granville, but by riding in our carriage, we escape the confusion that is ever to be found at railway stations ; we also had the advantage of riding straight to the meeting-house without the inconvenience of changing from the cars to the tram, to be left at some distance from the place of meeting. We had a very peaceful ride, and a very -favorable opportunity of con-versing together. This is a rare treat ; for both of us are so occupied that we have but little opportunity for social interchange of thought. We found a good representation of our people at the hall, and I felt constrained by the Spirit of God to speak very plainly to the church. I spoke from the words, "He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully." The manner in which the sowing was to be done, is presented in the following words : " Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so  let him give ; not grudgingly, or of necessity ; for God loveth a cheerful giver." No selfish man is a Christian. Jesus says, " If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." Genuine self-denial will be practiced by all who follow Christ. Judas undertook to follow Christ, and at the same time to carry out his selfish, covetous plans. He had the same privileges as had the other disciples. He had the same privileges of hear-ing the lessons of Christ, which plainly presented practical godliness ; but he was not always pleased with the plain truth. It cut him, and instead of taking up personal labor with Judas Iscariot, he found fault with the words and works of Christ, and criticised his plain teachings. Instead of being transformed in character, he was cultivating self-love, self-esteem, and the love of money, and was becoming more and more greedy for gain. His love for Christ was not increasing ; for he had not that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. Pure religion and undefiled is a religion that is of an experimental character, and brings forth practical results. Every member of the church of Christ will be tested and proved. To each one sacred responsi-bilities are committed ; for each one is to be con-nected with Christ, and to labor earnestly and cheerfully as a free moral agent, becoming more and more intelligent in working as a laborer "to-gether with God." By practice he must learn how to pray, putting his whole soul into his pe-titions. Through self-denial he must learn how to present gifts and offerings willingly unto God. He must not consume in selfish indulgence every-thing which he gains, and present nothing to God in acknowledgment of the fact that he is constantly the recipient of Heaven's gifts. The Christian will be constantly imparting that which is bestowed upon him. True religion is imitation of Christ. Not one of Christ's true followers will practice selfish indulgence in any way when the cause of God is languishing because of the poverty of the people. God means that some one shall supply that which is wanting for the needs of the poorer brethren, and for the necessi-ties of his cause. The kingdom of heaven must be the first consideration. To follow Christ means continually to study his life of self-denial, and from high motives to practice his good works. 'To follow means to render obedience. We are under service to God, and we must obey his commands. No soldier is counted a follower of his commander unless he obeys his general's orders. The master says, ''Learn of me. " Keep your eye on the model, for Christ gave his life that he might become the teacher of men. Keep yourselves from idols. He desires that every one who believes in him should learn how to live his life and practice his virtues. Jesus loved righteousness and hated iniquity. What is righteousness? ŠIt is the satisfaction that Christ gave the divine law in our behalf. He bore the test on every point on which the sin-ner must bear it. He was tempted in all points as we are tempted, and through all the temp-tations that it was possible for the synagogue of Satan to bring upon him, he did not yield in the least degree to the power of the enemy. Righteousness means being good and doing good. As children of God, are we developing a character that is Christlike? are we individu-ally working daily at the vocation of being a Christian ? and through the rich impartation of the gift of the Spirit of God, are we making straight paths for our feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way ? The lame are those who are not firmly established in the truth, who are spiritually halting, having defects of character and needing the help of a correct example. If we make crooked paths, others make'our errors an excuse for deviating from the path of righteous-ness. It is not enough to believe sound doc-trine ; we must put it into practice. A religion built on selfishness is worthless. It is a deplor-able, sleazy fabric, Ł The apostle plainly declares what is the duty of the individual members of the church. He says, " Let him give ; not grudgingly, or of necessity ; for God loveth a cheerful giver." The promise of God is that "he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully." The Lord will not forget your labors of love. In this country, times are very hard, and money is very scarce. Some will learn lessons of economy at this time, who never knew what economy was before. Yet we should not forget that we are in the service of God, and that he owns us, and he owns the world. Though we are all poor and unable to do large things, the Lord calls upon every soul to practice self-denial in this time of scarcity, and be able to give, not grudgingly nor of necessity, but with cheerful gratitude -for God's unspeakable gift. We are to engage in this work, seriously, remem-bering that now is the time to lay up treasure in heaven, and to send it on beforehand. We shall have to do this through strict self-denial ; but every man, woman, and youth, who claims to be the property of Christ, has a work to do in building up the kingdom of God. Now is .the sowing time, the reaping time is in the -future. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you. If you do your best, if you im-part to others that which you have, God will see your labor of love, and will know the mks-ure of every act of self-denial for his name's sake. ` You will be tested and proved, that it may be made manifest how deep and genuine is your love for Christ and your neighbor, and these tests will come closer and closer upon us. Churches must be erected. Wherever there is a little flock, it must be fed with meat in due season. The last message of mercy is to be given to the world even to the uttermost part of the earth. Those who have physical strength are to employ that strength in the service of God. They are to labor with their hands, and earn means to use in the cause of God. Those who can obtain work are to work faithfully, and to improve the opportunities they see to help those who cannot obtain labor. God is able to make his grace abound toward you, giv-ing you a heart of tenderness and love for the souls of those for whom Christ has paid the ransom of his own life. " That ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work ; (as it is written, He hath dispersed
