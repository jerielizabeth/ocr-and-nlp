D., Author of "Physical Education," "The Bible of Nature," etc. 7. prince Alexankr I. 4 WHEN the naturalist Brechm visited the United States on his last lecturing trip,. the American press correspondents often tried to elicit his views on sci-entific questions of the day, and once ventured upon the topic of moral evolution. "Is Nature neutral in such matters ? " asked one of his interviewers, " or can the survival of the fittest' be understood to mean the survival of the best man Šin anything but a prize fighter's sense of the word ?" "It mostly means the survival of the toughest," said the professor; "that toughness may happen to 4% be combined with beauty and agility, as in the case of the falcon and the squirrel, or simply with impud-dence and indifference to squalor, as in the case of ,the sparrow and the rat Šboth of them irrepressible 'survivors.' In the arena of social competition," he added, "it is sadly often the same." "You mean the noble and heroic are liable to be crowded out by impudent toughs, blest with an indif- ference to smudge ?" "Alas, yes," laughed the professor, " it cannot be denied that on a planet like ours, the chance of survival depends upon something besides noble sentiments. Sensitiveness, you know, is a primary condition of genius, just as sympathy is of benevolence ; and neither sensitiveness nor a ca-pacity for intense commiseration can be said to be -apeceizlly conducive to longevity. Just think of Lord Byron, or of the Black Prince, whom the sight of wounded soldiers affected .like a fever. Such men may accomplish wonders while they live, but that may be only a little while." The biographical chronicle of the last six months could have illustrated that truth in the still more  striking fate of Prince Alexander of Bulgaria Š per-haps the noblest man who has ascended a throne since the time of the philosopher-prince Saladin. In the formation of his character, Nature contrived to realize more than the ideal of the model knight Bayard,Š a cavalier, not only without reproach, but with numerous positive merits ; Frederick the Great's wit and energy without his misanthropic crotchets ; George the Second's zeal for reform without his peevish temper ; James the First's love of knowledge without a trace of his pedantry. Prince Alexander of Hessen Battenberg was a di-rect descendant of Landgrave Philip of Hessen, the protector of the first reformers, the same bold Prot-estant whom Ulrick Hutten called the manliest man of his century, and repeatedly proposed as a candidate for the throne of the German Empire. With the enterprise of that heroic ancestor, young Alexander had inherited a winsome disposition that made him the pet of the city of Darmstadt. Groups of peasant girls used to gather about the terrace of the Schloss park to have a chat with the little prince. More than one high guest of the Schloss offered to adopt or protect him ; and at least one of them, the Emperor of Austria, nobly redeemed his pledge in the storm and stress of after years. The pet of society was also a favorite of Nature, and reached his twelfth year without having made the personal acquaintance of any one of the numer-ous ailments of childhood. One main cause of that remarkable immunity was the boy's passionate love of outdoor lifeŠespecially of *oodland ram-bles. A hundred years ago one of his grand uncles,
