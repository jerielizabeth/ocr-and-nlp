62 YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. For the Youth's Instructor. Address to the Children. "Little children, keep yourselves from idols." 1 John v, 21. HESE words were originally addressed to the early Christians by the inspired writer, John, commonly called " the beloved disci- ple," who leaned on Jesus' breast. He uses the term "children," and "little children," as ex-pressive of his paternal affection for those whom he had brought to the light of the gospel. I am here reminded of the parting words of an aged Chris-tian as he was talking in a social meeting, just be-fore leaving Battle Creek for the West. He called the brethren little children, as expressive of the dif-ference of age, and his love for them. As no Scripture is of private interpretation, this text has the same bearing upon us as those whom the apostle was addressing. The human heart is as prone to idolatry as the sparks are to fly up-ward; hence the first words spoken by God in de-livering that great epitome of himself, the law of ten commandments on Mt. Sinai, " Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Idolatry was the sin of the ancient Israelites, and they were a typical people. I have often felt sur-prised that they could have made a golden calf and danced around it according to the form of idola-trous worship, after all the sublime and powerful manifestations they had witnessed of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and while the voice was yet ringing in their ears, " I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." May it serve to show us who have seen the marvellous light of the gospel, and heard the voice of God speaking to us through the third angel's message, that if God's ancient people to whom he audibly spoke, and whom he delivered by his own right hand and holy arm, to whom he was visible in the fiery flame and cloudy pillar, if they perished by the sin of idolatry, how much need we have of keeping ourselves from idols. God has spoken to us in these last days by his Son, and the closing words of his beloved disciple in his first epistle is, " Little children, keep your-selves from idols." Now, dear children of the rem-nant that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, have you any idols ? Examine your-selves, prove yourselves, and see if there be any wicked way in you. None of you will finally per-ish by the sin of idolatry if you pray earnestly to God to have your hearts searched as Jerusalem was of old with lighted candles. The word of God is compared to a lamp. Now let us use it to search into the dark corners of our hearts, and see if any idol is lurking there. They will often creep in when and where we least think. The Bible says, " Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Observe what you most naturally think of, and talk about, and you need not be ignorant of what you love best. " Their  sorrows shall be greatly multiplied that hasten after another God." I often think that the cruel enemy of mankind hates the God-given affections of human beings, and tries with all his Satanic cunning and malignity to embitter them at their fountain head. If he can only get those upon whom the responsibilities of life rest, in the relation of parents and children, brothers, sisters, and friends, to love each other too well, or not enough, he then stands ready to in-troduce an idol for worship exactly adapted to our circumstances. Oh, what need of a thorough un-derstanding of the wiles of Satan, for he is never tired of manufacturing idols. If we could only get a spiritual sight of his cabinet of curiosities, we would see by far a greater variety than Eld. Cornell did at the missionary rooms in Boston. The inventive genius of Satan seems to be increas-ing, as evinced by the new methods of pleasure-seeking. There can hardly be any money collect-ed for the benefit of the religious enterprises of the day, without being connected with some festival in which there is eating and drinking, which reminds me of the words of the apostle, "Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter." James v, 5. Day of slaughter! That word to us, dear chil-dren, has a terrible significancy. We know by the light we have on God's word, for " a good under-standing have all they that do the commandments," that the wicked and ungodly, the unholy and pro-fane, are preparing for a day of slaughter, when the slain of the Lord shall be from one end of the earth to the other, and shall be neither buried nor lamented. The harvest of the earth appears to be fast ripening, and the time hasteth greatly when they will be gathered into bundles to be burned; but they must first drink of the wine of the wrath of God, poured out of the cup of his indignation without mixture of mercy. Is it any wonder, then, that we do not want to run with them to the same excess of riot ? Dear childrenŠit is truly a grand, awful, and solemn time in which we are living. Satan would fain keep us ignorant of the fact by his different means of excitement, and the various forms of worldly pleasure that dance before us ignite fatuur like. Yet it is nevertheless true that we are form-ing characters for eternal life or eternal death. Which will we choose, not merely desire, but vol- untarily and understandingly choose ? I envy not the lovers of pleasureŠtheir portion here and here-after. " I have got my eye," as another has said, " on the immortal inheritance ; I want to see the King in his beauty"Šso let the idols of earth go to the moles and bats. Let us fasten our hopes in the skies, and seek for glory, honor, immortality, eter-nal life. Then shall we find it easy to obey the af-fectionate words of the disciple whom Jesus loved, " Little children, keep yourselves from idols." M. H. L. Battle Creek, Mich. 9 {fig
