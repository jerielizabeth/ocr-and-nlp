THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 63 A LOVELY SIGHT. WHERE is a lovelier sight on earth, So like to Heaven above, As children of one family, Dwelling in peace and love ! Kindly, unselfishly, they seek Bitch other's happiness; Surely the angels look and smile On such a scene as this. And Jesus from his dazzling throne, Beyond the azure sky, Is watching o'er these little lambs, To save them by-and-by. "Love one another," saith the Lord, " Thus prove your love to me, For they who love in deed and truth, Shall my disciples be." R. C. BAKER. Troubles. SOME good Christians have a great deal of trouble in this world. The reason of it is that God is preparing them for very great happiness in Heaven. Last summer when in the city of Amster-dam, in Holland, I was very much interested in a visit we made to a place there famous for polishing diamonds. We saw the men as they were engaged in this work. When a diamond is first found, it has a rough, dark outside, and looks just like a common pebble. The outside must be ground off god the dia-mond be polished before it is fit for use. It takes a long time to do this, and it is very hard work. The diamond has to be fixed very firmly in the end of a piece of hard wood or metal. Then it is held close to the surface of a large metal wheel which is kept going round. Fine diamond-dust is put on this wheel, because nothing else is hard enough to polish the diamond. And this work is kept on for days, and weeks, and months, and sometimes for several years before it is finished. And if a diamond is intended to be used in the crown of a king, then longer time and greater pains are spent upon it, so as to make it look as brilliant and beautiful as can be. Now, Jesus calls his people his jewels. He intends them to shine like jewels in the crown he will wear in Heaven. To fit them for this they must be polished like the diamond. And God makes use of the troubles he sends on his people in this world to polish his jew-els. And when we get to Heaven and see how beautiful they look, we shall see that it was indeed good for them that they were troubled. It has fitted them for greater hap-piness there.ŠChristian Weekly. Ye Mast Be Born Again. YOUR first, or natural, birth connects you with Adam, and places you under the curse. You need a second birth to connect you with Christ, and bring you under the blessing. Yea, this second birth is as essential to your eternal happiness as the first was to your existence. Our Lord himself declares, "Ye must be born again." This change is not a change of creed, or an amendment of life simply; nor is it ef-fected by baptism, or the Lord's supper. It . is a change of heart wrought in us by the Holy-Ghost. Have you experienced it? and can you say, as did the blind man, " Whereas I was blind, now I see" ? Happy are you if this be your condition. But if notŠif like Nicodemus you ask, "How can these things be ?"Šlet me assure you that your first con-cern should be to know the subject experi-mentally. A mere doctrinal knowledge of regeneration will not save you ; you must have the experience. Your own eyes must  be enlightened, your own ears unstopped, your own heart renewed. You are not to be the physician in your case, but the patient. It is not another that is diseased, but your-self. Oh ! lay it to heart. Let your soul's condition trouble you; and never desire to know rest until you find it in Christ, and in a sure hope of immortality.ŠSel. George's Reason. THE scholars of Mr. Jones' school, had all, save one, entered the school and taken their seats, when George Hardy, a tardy scholar for once, came hurrying in much out of breath. "Why, George," said his teacher, "how is this ? I saw you, as I supposed, on your way to school, when I started from home. I hope you have not been away at play, when you should have been at school." " No, sir, I have not played any this morn-ing; I thought I could run home, and be back before school began." ‚! But why did you wish to return home? Did you forget anything ?" "No, sir."  " What did you go back for, then ?" "If you will please excuse me, sir, I would rather not tell." "I hardly think I can excuse you, George; you are very late, for you, and I have a right to demand a good reason for it." George stepped up, and placing his lips close to his teacher's ear, whispered, "I met a boy who was without shoes, and as I had a pair which I had outgrown, I went home to get them for him." Was that the reason ?" asked the teacher, looking upon the blushing boy with kindness and approval. " Yes, sir." " Why, then, did you not wish to tell me ?" "Because, sir, my mother says when I give anything in charity, I must do it pri-vately, lest I should receive praise of men, and become vain and proud."ŠPicture Mag-azine. A Little Candle, but Shining Far. A MOTHER, on the green hills of Vermont, was holding by the right hand a son, sixteen years old, mad with the love of the sea. And as she stood at the garden gate one morning, she said: "Edward, they tell meŠfor I never saw the oceanŠthat the great temptation of a seaman's life is drink. Promise me, before you quit your mother's hand, that you will never drink liquor." "And," said he, for he told the story, "I gave the promise, and went the globe over, to Calcutta, the Mediterranean, San Fran-cisco, and the cape of Good Hope, the North and South Poles ; I saw them all in forty years, and I never saw a glass filled with sparkling liquor that my mother's form at-the gate did not rise up before my eyes, and to-day I am innocent of the taste of liquor." Was that not sweet evidence of the power of a single word ? Yet that is not half, "for," still continued he, "yesterday there came into my counting-room a man of forty years. " ' Do you know me ?' " No.' " Well,' said he, I was brought drunk into your presence on ship-board ; you were a passenger; they kicked me aside; you took me to your berth and kept me there till I had slept off the intoxication. You then asked me if I had a mother; I said I had never heard a word from her lips ; you told me of yours at the garden gate, and to-day I am master of one of the finest ships in  New York harbor, and I have come to ask you to come and see me.' " How far the little candle throws its beam. The mother's words- on the green hills of Vermont! God be thanked for the mighty power of a single word IŠ Wendell Phillips. A Hint to Meddlers. A LITTLE white rose bloomed all by herself in a nook in the hedge. '" Ah !" cried the wind in passing, " what a pity. you should be suffocated there. I will blow a hole in the hedge, and the breeze shall find you through it." " I pray, sir, you will leave me as I am ; I breathe well enough," said the rose. "I know better," said the wind, and rent the hedge as he passed on, and the boys rushed through and made her tremble with fear. "You are riot well placed there," he said, as he came by again; "I will give you a better berth than that." "I beg you will leave me as I am; I like my place well enough if it were not for the gap you made," said the rose. But the wind would not listen. He broke her stem, and she fell to the ground. " Oh, you musn't lie there I" he cried ; " I will carry you to the spot that will suit you exactly." " Nay, I entreat you to let me lie and fade in this pleasant grass," said the rose beseech-ingly; but he caught her-up and whirled her on a few yards, when her petals were scat-tered, and her leafless stem was cast on the hedge. "How is this?" exclaimed the wind. "How is it? This is how it is," replied the hedge : " There are some folks that are never satisfied but when they are meddling in other folk's affairs ; they think nobody can be happy except in their way; and you are one of them, and this bare stem is a speci-men of your work."ŠChild's World. Daisy's Flowers. DAISY had nothing but flowers in her little plot, and it bloomed all summer long with a succession of gay or fragrant posies. She was very fond of her garden, and delved away in it at all hours, watching over her roses, pansies, sweet-peas, and mignonette, as faith-fully and tenderly as she did over her dolls or her friends. Little nosegays were sent into town on all occasions, and certain vases about the house were her especial care. She had all sorts of pretty fancies about her flow-ers, and loved to tell the children the story of the pansy, and show them how the step-mother-leaf sat up in her green chair in pur-ple and gold; how the two own children, in gay yellow had each its little seat, while the step-children, in dull colors, both sat on one small stool, and the poor little father, in his red night-cap, was kept out of sight in the middle of the flower, that a monk's dark face looked out of the mock's-hood larkspur, that the flowers of the canary-vine were so like dainty birds fluttering their yellow wings, that one almost expected to see them fly away, and the snapdragons that went off like little pistol shots when you cracked them. Splendid dollies did she make iout of scarlet and white poppies, with ruffled robes tied round the waist with grass-blade sashes, and astonishing hats of coriopsis on their green heads. Pea-pod boats, with rose-leaf sails, received these flower-people, and floated them about a placid pool in the most charming style ; for finding that there were no elves, Daisy made her own, and loved the fanciful little friends who played their parts in her summer.life.ŠMtivilcott.
