226 GENERAL HYGIENE. the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel, hired out his army to the British government, and invested nearly the en-tire profits of the transaction in the creation of the fairy realm of Wilholmohohe. A double avenue of oak trees, graded, and straight as a ruler, leads up from the Cassel ramparts to a mountain plateau, where some forty thousand acres of ground were turned into a summer park. Groves of majestic pines and beaches alternate with mountain mead-ows, dome-like grottoes, and cascades, the whole crowned by a castle with a colossal statue of Hercules on its pinnacle, and a collection of antiquities rivalled only by the Imperial Museum of Vienna. On a summer trip to Cassel, young Alexander visited that Alhambra of the North in the company of his tutor, and after a half hour's ramble in the mountain park, suddenly clutched his mentor's arm and burst into a flood of tears. The inquiries of the astonished pedagogue elicited the fact that the woods, the forest meadows, and the singing thrushes had so far sur-passed the boy's conceptions of heaven that now for the first time he was appalled at the thought of death, and perhaps also at the approaching end of the vaca-tion that threatened his departure from this re-discovered paradise. He afterward often declared that no marvels of architecture had ever affected him in a similar man-ner, and that a display of articles of luxury left him indifferent, or even annoyed him with the anticipated necessity of having to refrain from romping in a show-case room of that sort. "Ich will ein Foerster werden," Š"I want to be a manager of a government forest,"Šwas for years his usual reply, when he was asked about his predilec-tions in the choice of a vocation. His father, however, sent him to the cadet school, the Darmstadt Military Academy, to " brush the aristocratic cobwebs out of his head," as he expressed it. If there was any necessity for that process of expurgation, the prescription certainly answered its purpose; within a few months the new cadet was as popular with his fellow tyros as with his teachers, and soon became an expert gymnast. Thanks to the efforts of the reformer Jahn, athletic exercises have become a regular branch of education in all public schools and especially in the regimental schools of the military barracks, where the officer of the day is expected to supervise the Turner hall attached to every drill shed. In the controversies about the expedience of main-taining vast standing armies, Prince Battenberg often remarked that one main offset to the evils of the sys-tem was the guarantee of turning out trained athletes  at the rate of 155,000 a year. Gymnasiums, to be sure, are also attached to every village school, but as a facetious recruiting sergeant said of his awkward squad, " You cannot expect all the cardinal virtues for thirty cents a day," and a fagged-out village ped-agogue with a hungry family and $ zoo dollars a year, cannot always be expected to resist the temptation of neglecting the gymnasium side show. The training of the regimental Turners, on the other hand, is thorough in the strictest Prussian sense of the word, and the adoption of a similar plan was one of Prince Alexander's first reforms in the work of re-organizing the Bulgarian army. About 85 per cent of the commissioned officers of the German army are still selected from the scions of aristocracy, and the advancement of a cadet prince would have been pretty rapid ; but the namesake of the Macedonian campaigner detested garrison life, and in 1877 solicited employment in the expedition which the Russian government was then fitting out for active service in the Balkan. " He entered as a volunteer attaché, with the rank of a second lieutenant," says one of his companions in arms, " and under circumstances where even the berth of a captain was no bed of roses ; but a month after his arrival the young volunteer had no reason to complain Šhe had become the idol of the Russian soldiers and the favorite companion of the Russian staff officers. They actually intrigued to procure his temporary transfer to their own brigades, no sympo-sium, no after-parade chat was considered complete without the bright young foreigner who had no enemy even among his rivals, and whose conversa-tional abilities would have enlivened Savage Landor's dialogues in Tartarus." But popularity was all the more remarkable be-cause the young volunteer set that "vodka"-worship-ing horde an example of almost total abstinence. He also abhorred the promiscuous gallantries of the young Russian officers, but evaded the charge of pedantry by his talent for banter, and his readiness to join in any other kind of madcap frolic. After the lapse of twenty care-fraught years, a glance at his portrait still justifies the verdict of the Empress of Austria, who pronounced him the "handsomest army officer of Christendom" (possibly with a moral reser-vation in favor of the Circassian chieftain), and pre-dicted his rapid advancement if he would 'turn his attention to diplomacy. Russian soldiers have earned a reputation for cosmopolitan tolerance in recognizing merit of that sort; and the historians of the first Napoleon's invasion of the Muscovite Empire attest the fact that in the midst of a delirium Ł AI
