There, on bended knees, Rome pelled that aged man to pronounce "the proposition that the sun is the center of the world to be absurd, philosophically false, and formally heretical; beca nse it is expressly contrary to the Holy Scripture "-and ther to pronounce "the proposition that the earth is not in the center of the world, nor immovable, but that it moves, and also with a diurnal motion, to be also absurd, t<ophically false, and, theologically ered, at least erroneous in faith." The old man pronounced the required abjuration, rose from his knees, and then whispered to a friend, "It does move though." . . 
His works and those of Copernicus, and other eminent astronomer, Foscarini, were all put in the Index of Prohibited Books, and remained there up to tae year 1828, since which time they have been silently omitted."* Said Victor Hugo to the priests, "Ah, we know you. \Ve know the clerical party. It iR an old party. This it is which forbids to science and genius the going beyond the :Miss11l, and which wishes to cloister thought in dogmas. Every step which the gence of Europe has taken has been in spite of it. Its history is written in the history of human progress, but it is written on the r:( the lwf. It is opposed to it all. This it which caused Prinelli to be scourged for 11M ing said that the stars would not fall. This it is which put Campanella seven times to the torture for having affirmed that the number of worlds was infinite, and for ing caught a glimpse of creation. This it is which persecuted Harvey for having proved tbe circulation of the blood. In the name of J e1ms, it shut up Galileo. In the name of St. Paul, it imprisoned Christopher bus. To discover a law of the heavens was an jmpiety; to find a world was a here8y." "You wish us to give you the people to instruct. Very well. Let us see your pils! Let us see those you ba.ve produced.

Yes, Italy is, of all the States of Europe, that where the smallest number of know how to read." "Spain, magnificently endowed; Spain, which received from the Romans her first civilization, from the Arabs her seconcl ili:r.ation, from Providence, and in spite of you, a world-America: Spain, thanks to you, to your yoke of stupor-which is a yoke of degradation and decay-Spain bas lost this secret power, which it had from the H.ornans; this genius of art, which it had from the Arabg; this world, which it had from God ; and in exchange for ali that you have made it lose, it has received from you -the inquisition."* After quoting the above, Hemphil says: "If the priests are the educators they claim to be, let us see what they have done for our neighbors, the Mexicans. Mexico was njzed a whole century before New England. Its first settlers were the noblest spirits of Spain in her Augustan age-the epoch of Cen·antes, Cortez, Pizarro, Columbus, zalo de Cordova, Xemenes, and Mexico has been educated by the priests since the fifteenth century; and her career has been glorious ! !

How A PoPE Dm:D.-It is said of Pope Pius V. that, when he was dying, he cried out in despair: "When I was in low tion, I had some hopes of salvation; when I adYanced to be a cardinal, I greatly doubted it; but since I came to the popedom, I have no hope at all." ------A CHRISTIA:Y profession must be open and public.

THE denial of the existence of sin, and of man's accountability for his actionlil, tends directly to destroy conscientiousness and to remove all feeling of just restraint. Under such teachings, people become reckless and immoral, as certainly as any effect can low its cause. But this has been the vailing theory of spiritualism since its rise. \Ve quote briefly from prominent ists. A work published by N. P. madge that God does not condemn any one. It also says:-" Unto -God there is no error; all is comparative good.'' And of an inspired teacher it says:-" He vieweth error as God vieweth it, as undeveloped good." A. J. Davis says:-"Sin, indeed, in the common acceptation of that term, does not really exist."-Nat. Div. Rev., p. 521. "The innate divineness of the spirit hibits the possibility of spirilual wickedness, or unrighteousness."-Jd. p. 413. And he says again:-"In the Hebrew and Christian Scriptnres it is affirmed sin is the transgressiOn of the law. But by an examination of nature, the true and only Bible, it will be seen that this statement is erroneous. It gives a wrong idea both of man and law. . . . 
It will be found impossible for man to gress a law of God." The above is from a lecture on the osophy of Reform," given in New York city; but if this is true, there is neither need nor chance for reform, unless it is God's will that needs reforming ! But be goes further, and says:-'' Reformers need to understand that war is as natural to one stage of human ment as peace is natural to another. My brother has the spirit of revenge. Shall I call him a demon? Is not his spirit natural to his condition ? War is not evil or sive, except to a man of peace. Who made the warrior ? Who made the non-resistant? Polygamy is as natural to one stage of velopment as oranges are natural to the Soutb. Shall I grow indignant, and, cause I am a monogamist, condemn my man of yore ? Who made him? Who made me? We both came up under the confluence of social and political stances; and we both represent our tions and our teachers. The doctrine of blame and praise is natural only to an philosophical condition of mind. The spirit of complaint-of attributing 'evil' to this and that plane of society-is natural; but is natural to undeveloped minds. It is a profanation-a sort of atheism of which I would not be guilty. And all our religions, all onr schemes of reformation, operating on this superficial plane, need the very elements which are necessary to reform." So revenge, war, polygamy, and every olation of the principles of morality, may not be blamed. According to "the true and only Bible," it is impossible to do wrong ! To call murder and adultery evil is "a sort of atheism." When this lecture was given, in 185 7, we said they might go further in practice than they bad then gone, but in the theory of lawlessness they were fully oped. This declaration of Davis, who is the chief apostle of spiritualism, will sanction every abomination which has since been ma.nifested among them. A. P. McCombs, a spiritualist, in a tract entitled, " Whatever is, is Right, ted," !!lays:-" I will not contend about how Pope or anybody else viewed the axiom, or into what departments of God's universe they give it entrance; I believe that 'whatever is, is right,' in its fullest and broadest sense, ering every act in the past, presE.'nt, and ture." More testimony to this point will be given when we come to speak of the immoral dencies of the system, and the practices of its adherents. It is well known that they teach that the spirits obtain entire control of the mediums, and that passive yielding to their influence is necessary to development as good ums. Any prudent person would wish to know the nature of the spirits to which he had so passively to yield, and avoid the fluence, nnless he could fully identify them. But so reckless are spiritualists that they court the influence and control of the spirits, while they confess that they cannot identify them. We will prove this by quotations from the very best spiritualist authorities. A Mr. Hobart, of St. Joseph Co., Mich., in 1857, in a discussion on spiritualism, said:-" The spirit sometimes assumes the name of an individual belonging to the same church, to induce them to hear. This is necessary with some who are so bigoted they would not believe unless a name was assumed which they respected.'" This was an admission that we did not then suppose any intelligent spiritualist would make. We had not before known that they had so little confidence in these communications, but investigation proves the fact. Yet it is an obvious fact that all spiritualists have changed in their faith and lives under the influence of the spirits. This is a point worthy of careful consideration, that they are continually being molded and fashioned by an influence in which they dare not publicly avow the least confidence. Joel Tiffany was an able speaker and lisher among them. In a discussion with Pres. Mahan, in Cleveland, be said:-"Persons have supposed that when they get correct answers they get But when we come to understand that the spirit can come into rapport with the mind in the cle, we then discover that he can his thoughts and get the m1szoer as well as the question from his mind, and then beincr in communication with the medium can swer all his question, and give him perfect answers, as to identity, at the same time that he is a far different spirit from what he . purports to be." Judge Edmonds, in "Spiritual Tracts," No.7, page 4-, says:-" One day while I was at West Roxbury, there came to me through Laura as the dium, the spirit of one with whom I had been well acquainted, but from whom I had been separated some fifteen years. His was a very peculiar character-one unlike that of any other man whom I ever knew, and so strongly marked that it was not easy to take his identity. "I bad not seen him in several years; he was not at all in my mind at the time, and he was unknown to the medium. Yet be identified himself unmistakably, not only by his peculiar characteristics, but by referring to matters known only to him and me. "I took it for granted he was dead, and was surprised afterward to learn that he was not. He is yet living. "I cannot, on this occasion, go into all the particulars of au interview which lasted more than an hour. I was certain there was :no delusion about it, and as certain that it was just as much of a. spirit manifestation as any I ever witnes8ed or heard of." But the credulity of spiritualists knows no bounds. With all the evidenr.Je before him, and the well·known admissions of' itualists that lying spirits personate our friends so well as to defy detection, the Judge yet thinks it was the spi.rit of his friend yet living ! The following experience of a circle of " six ladies and gentlemen" is taken from the Boston Bee. The spirit of a dog first identified itself. The paper states:-"Several satisfactory answers were given relative to its name, that of its late master, time of its decease; &c .... The next spirit was that of a cat, who revealed the secret that it had been drowned while at a very tender age, in a cistern, by a young lady who was present. The answers in this stance were correct and satisfactory. "After this, a gentleman (who was a dium) asked if the spirit of a favorite horse was present. The raps were in the ti.ve. The raps then gave the name of the horse by the alphabet, 1ts age, the number of years it bad been dead, the name of the place where it had been struck by lightning, &c." These were as "satisfactory tests" as have ever been obtained. A. J. Davis, in answer to a question cerning the appearance of spirits, Raid :-"These appearances are intended merely as reminders and as tests of identity. All telligent spirits are great artists. They can psychologize a me:lium to see them, and to describe them, in the style which would duce the greatest impression on the receiver. . . . 
They can easily represent themselves as being old or young, as in worldly dress or in flowing robes, as is deemed best suited to accomplish the ends of the visitation. They substitute pantomime and appearance for oral explanations." In the Spiritual Telegraph of July 11, 1857, the leading editorial is entitled, "On the Identification of Spirits." The ing is the commencement of the article:-"The question is continually being asked, especially by novitiates in spiritual investi· gations, How shall we know that the spirits who communicate with us are really the ones whom they purport to be ? and for want of a. satisfactory anl"wer many minds are thrown into perplexity, and even doubt, as to whether the so-called spiritual festations are really such. In giving the sults of our own experience and observation upon this subject, we would premise that spirits unquestionably can, and often do, personate other spirits, and that, too, often with such perfection as, for the time being, to defy every effort to detect the deception. Not only can they represent the leading sonal characteristics of the spirits whom they purport to .be, but they can relate such facts in the history of said spirits, as may be known to the inquirer, or to some one else with whom the communicating spirit is or has been en rapport. And this, in our opinion, is done so often as to very ly diminish the value of any specific tests that may be designedly instituted by the inquir· er for the purpose of proving identity; and that if direct tests are demanded at all, we would -recommend that they be asked for tbe purpose of proving that the manifesting fluence is that of a spirit, rather than to prove what pm·ticular spirit is the agent of its production.l' So it appears that all their talk about "tests" and "test mediums" iA entitled to no credit whatever. The "experience and observation " of the editor .of the Telegraph entitles his testimony to as much credit as that of any spirituali8t in the country. cording to his view we can only assure selves "that the manifesting is that of a. spirit," which we would not deny, but we cannot ascertain "what particular spirit" is communicating, as they 4' personate with such perfection as to defy every effvrt to detect the deception." This is all that we have ever claimed, or could claim, in regard to thi8 great system of falsehood. The lowing from the same article is equally pressive of their characters and actions:-"From much experience and ob8ervation, however, we are satisfied that if, after ing received, in all good faith, such sages directly from the spirit friend whom it purports to be, we proceed to inquiries about matters of theological faith or lative philosophy, or even about such tical concerns of human life as may involve the ambition, conceits, or prejudices of other spirits than the one with whom up to that moment we have been talking, then other spirits who may be more nearly related to, or who may have more perfect control over, the mediums, will most probably assume stantly the name and position of our friend, pushing the latter aside, and will set forth his own theories, fancies, and probably ties, using the name of our friend and all the confidence we may have gained in the lat· ter's identity, by way of enforcing what be would have us believe. And we receive the communication perhaps with the utmost sur-· prise that our friend, in passing into the spirit world, should have so soon changed his opinion on that particular subject ! " A. J. Davis makes a statement similar to the above. If only the main points of the spiritual theory were true, we could not be surprised if all changed their minds in many respects when they enter the "spheres." But what a confession is this! How pletely are all their tests of identity and claims of reliability swept away. Mr. Tiffany has also given pointed dence on this subject:-" When communications are received through public mediums, the probabilities are that the communicators belong to a very low plane of development, and that the munications cannot be rehed upon, whatever may be the professions of the communicator. There is almost always an infl.uence which belongs peculiarly to each medium-an fluence which seems to be a presiding spirit, which that medium will usually recognize, answering to the name of 'Jim' or 'John.' It is generally the case that this spirit will be found on hand first, and is the one to do whatever is to be done, and he becomes the father, mother, brother, sister, or friend of every body. . . . 
The circumstances of a public circle are exceedingly unfavorable to getting communications from spirits of a high degree of refinement. The most that can be obtained under such conditions is some external evidence of spiritual ence. The point to which i wish to call your attention is the almost universal fact that mediums devoted to external tions, while under the intluence of this siding spirit, are under an influence to ceive, to cheat, which is almost irresistible . It does not. matter particularly how good manifestations they get. I have seen this deceptive disposition manifested in mediums who conld _get very remarkable tions, as the movement, in the open light, of a table with several men standing upon it."-Lect. pp. 122, 123. 
These are quite sufficient to prove the point. And such being the facts, all can see that deception and delusion are able ·in the practical workings of ism. We propose now to o:tfer proof from their own writings, that it is not a mild or innocent deception, but a very dangerous one. J. H. W .AGGONBR.
