He is well aware that the first day of the week is not the ' Sabbath-day ' of the Bible, and that noScriptural injunction or command applies to it, and if he was candid and honest with his congregation he would confess the fact. As a theological student, Mr. Crafts knows that the first day of the week (Sun- day) had its first official recognition in an edict of the Emperor Constantine in 321, ordering that all work should cease in the cities Sunday, but per- mitting necessary husbandry to be attended to by the farmers. In the early ages of Christianity-  it was not supposed that Sunday had taken the place of the holy Sabbath established by Jehovah him- self, according to Moses and inspired Scripture. Sunday as a religious day is called the ' Lord's day,' and traces its origin as such to a practice of the early Christians to meet early Sunday morn- ing to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. It was purely a voluntary practice until Constantine is- sued his edict, and it is not the Sabbath of the Bi- ble, and its observance has no relation to the work of creation, or the rest of the Almighty on the seventh day from his six day's labor. Our Sun- day is not the Sabbath of the Bible, and has no di- vine origin, but is a human institution begun among the early Christians to commemorate Christ's resurrection, by an early morning service, and was made a holiday by a Constantinople mon- arch, and was never observed by any Christian people as an austere holy day, except by the Pu- ritans and those whom they could influence in this country and Great Britain. The continental ob- observance of Sunday at present is practically the same as it always has been ever since Constantine issued his edict in A. D. 321. Mr. Crafts is un- doubtedly aware of all these facts, but it don't suit his craft to avow them from his pulpit." - . matter. The truth is, however, unless we greatly mistake, the priest simply emulated the example of his superior. The fact is, precisely such an ad- dress was delivered by Bishop Ranney of Vicks-burg upon a like occasionŠthe dead man having neglected the church ordinances. In the same manner as that adopted by rather Kelly, and in almost the very same words, the Bishop denounced the man's memory, pictured his awful misery in sulphurous flames: Lost, lost, —lost I he exclaimed in piercing accents, and then dropping his voice he asked in the words of Tennyson's Vision of Sin, ' Is there any-  hope ? ' A glimmerŠa glimmer, said the Bishop impressively. His friends were wealthy ; they could have masses said for his soul, and then perhaps for the sake of these interces- sions he might be delivered. What a solemn re- sponsibility rested on those friends I he exclaim-ed,Šand so on to the end of the chapter. " These instances have a parallel in the case of a Protestant funeral from the old Western Hotel in Cortland street, some fifteen years ago. A Free- mason had suddenly diedŠone who gave liberally to the poor, and was an estimable man, but not a confessing Christian. The clergyman selected to conduct the services, denounced the man as having been a member of a secret order. And in the pros- ence of the bereaved widow and daughters he de-Glared it his solemn duty to say his soul was lostŠhe was now in eternal misery whence he should never escape. What an awful fate, what a solemn warningŠawful harrowing thought,Ša lost, a suf-fering soulŠtoo late, too late, too lateŠhis excla-nations mingled with the shrieks of the bereaved, who were in an agony of grief. Finally, a gentle- man stepped up to the minister and compelled him to stop. The awful mistake of this minister, and the dreadful character of his unfeeling, un-Chris-tian address will not soon be forgotten by those who heard it. Fortunately these cases are rare, and the monsters who supply them happily have not the means of perpetuating their monstrosities through their offspring. Not all the sins of the fathers, thank God, are visited upon the children." -  CRAFTS' SABBATH SERMON. IN last week's REVIEW mention was made of a sermon by W. F. Crafts, in advocacy of a more strict observance of Sunday, which he calls the  Sabbath, in which he urged its recognition as a re- ligious institution. But many of the world's pee- ple are learning how to answer the vain and fool- ish arguments of the clergy on this point, as the accompanying article plainly shows. A writer sig,ping himself "Truth-feller," in the Chicago Tribune of July 29, though erroneously calling b the Sabbath a Mosaic institution, answers Mr. Crafts' arguments in the following forcible style :Š "A. clerical gentleman, Mr. W. F. Crafts, now of the First Union Presbyterian Church of New York, delivered a long discourse Sunday evening in the First Congregational Church, West Side, on the topic, ' The Continental Sunday and the Danger of its .Introduction into America.' The discourse is a singular admixture of false assump- Lion and erroneous deduction. He persisted in treating the Constantine Sunday as the same in- stitution as the holy Sabbath of the Jews insti- tided by Moses 1,800 years before Constantine was born I Throughout his entire discourse Mr. Crafts slurred over and ignored the vital point that the Sabbath-day and Sunday are not the same day at all. He concealed from his hearers the fact that the ' holy Sabbath-day' is the seventh or last day of the week, whereas Sunday is the first day of the week. He concealed from his audience the reason given in the Jewish Scriptures for the institution of the Sabbath-day, and Ł he also con- cealed from them the truth that there is no script- ural authority either in the Old or New Testament for discarding the seventh day of the week or Sat- urday as the Sabbath, and substituting the first day of the week or Sunday as a holy day. It  is a  wonder that some man did not rise in the audience and ask Mr. Crafts for his authority for abolishing of Constantine. It would havA surely puzzled the clerical gentleman to explain it satisfactorily or to show that Sunday is the day specified in the fourth commandment. Mr. Crafts took for his text a passage from the last chapter of Nehemiah, de- nouncing the 'profanation' of SaturdayŠnot Sun- first. Why did not Mr. Crafts point out this fact to his hearers I Was it honest or truthful to sup- press it? If he had turned to the twentieth chap- ter of Exodus and read from the 8th to the 11th verses, inclusive, his audience would have heard the fourth commandment stated and explained. The reason is there given why Moses selected the seventh or last day of the week instead of the first or some other day of the week. The reason for Saturday is that, ' in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the seas and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day [last day of the week] wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath- day [last day of the week] and hallowed it.' The same commandment also explicitly commands : ' Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work [viz. : Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday], but the seventh day [Saturday] is the Sabbath [or resting day] of the Lord thy God ; in it thou shalt not do any work,' etc. " These passages from Moses' writings explain the whole Sunday business,Šits origin, the par- titular day chosen for rest, and the reason therefor. "Now the day selected by the Rev. Crafts for a holy day turns the whole thing wrong end fore- most. He insists that everybody shall rest and worship on the very day the Almighty, according to Moses, ordered his chosen people to work and do secular business ! On the first day of the week (Sunday) God, according to Moses, began his great work of creation. By Friday night, or the sixth day, he had completed it, and Saturday, the seventh or last day of the week, he had finished his labors and rested. God, as per Moses, com- manded his chosen people to imitate his example and do likewise, and they have strictly observed the order for 3,700 years. " Where does Mr. Crafts get his Scripture au- thority for upsetting all this arrangement, and or- i and the minds of men be dis-keeping A HOT-BED OF INIQUITY. AN ABOMINATION. a petite principality of eight square miles on the Mediterranean near Nice, is forcing a itself into obnoxious amte throughout Europe. With a salubrious climate, and surrounded by scenery unsurpassed, its princely owner has made it a plague-spot of corruption, against which there is rising an irrepressible storm of indignation. Since great gambling-places of Germany were sup- pressed, Monaco is the only place in Europe where . this destructive vice is legalized. To its huge a gambling-hall flock all that is vile and contemptible, so that it is fitly styled the " Continental Hell." Its manager is reputed to make an annual income of £700,000, which involves the staking of at least £25,000,000 upon his tables. Some idea of the vast sums worse than wasted, and of the con-sequent anxiety, suffering, and privation that must occasioned, can thus be gained. But this is not all. There is about one suicide a week among those who have staked and lost their all, and mur- ders and base immoralities abound. Public senti- ment is at last aroused against it as never before. Queen Victoria, the Emperor of Germany, King Humbert of Italy, and the French Government are now bringing all their influence to bear upon the abolition of this perpetual hot-bed of gambling, and it is hoped that they will be able to drive the curse from its last resting-place in Europe.ŠS'e/. the Sabbath of Moses and substituting the SundayMONACO, day; of the last day of the week instead of thethe THE public press very justly cries out with in-dignation against the course pursued by the minis- ters mentioned in the following narrative. But there is something else deserving of indignation besides the ministers. They were but making a practical application of the creed they hold. They could plead the widely-entertained doctrine of the immortality of the soul, the conscious state of the dead, the entrance of all men upon rewards and punishments at death, and the eternal torment of the damned. They should have been better than their theory; but without these ghastly God-dishon- oring delusions, such scenes as are described below would happily be impossible. Then let the false doctrine be exposedbe inthralled from these figments of a fiendish imag- ination. We copy from the Christian at Work of July 17, 1884, the following :Š "Public attention has recently been directed to the singular character of an address delivered at a funeral at Jersey City, N. J., by Father Kelly of that place. Before the crowded audience composed of Catholics and Protestants, the priest proceeded to berate the dead man. He had, said the priest, been faithless to his duties, to the Church, neglect- ing her ordinances, worship, and rites. He must pay the penalty. His soul must groan in the tor- rents of purgatory, that dark and mysterious prison-house which the soul enters after death, and escapes from with great difficulty, even under the most favorable circumstances. - In this case the prospect was appalling. The man had gone to his doom without any preparations. There was a bare possibility that God may have pardoned him at the last ; but this was only a remote hope. In all likelihood, so Father Kelly said, Detective Bowe's soul is now suffering the burnings of fire and brim- stone. If his Roman Catholic friends pray for him unceasingly for years and years, his soul may be released ; but to prayer must be added penance and sacrifice, and even then the prospect was gloomy. " It is said that the relatives and friends left the church frantic with grief and anger, and that the Bishop's attention has been directed to the ŠMonsignor Capel is reported as saying in his recent Washington lecture that there is a steadily increasing movement toward the Church of Rome among the upper classes in England, and predict-ing the approach of a time when there will be but two parties there, Catholics and Infidels. He said that during a period of a few months 300 clergy of the Church of England had become mem- bers of the Roman Catholic Church. Whatever allowance may be made for exaggeration, there is enough in these utterances to confirm the opinion that the English Church is not the bulwark of Protestantism it has declared itself to be. It gives Rome many adherents and makes few re- prisals. Father Gavazzi used to say that ritualism is the intruding head of the Roman Catholic snake. The head admitted, the rest of the snake soon follows.ŠEx.
