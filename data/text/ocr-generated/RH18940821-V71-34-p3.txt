AUGUST 21, 1894r ADVENT REYIEW AIM SABBATH HERALD. 531 lack of mercy, like nothing out of Satan's own realm. Let charity cover the sins of others, that it may cover the multitude of our own. Let us spare our judgment of our fellow-men. Let us be humble enough to believe that we are not infallible, and be merciful as we hope for mercy. Let us imitate Christ, who "judged no man," who rescued the sinner from the hands of violence, who " Went about doing good." Man may judge by visible results ; but in that court not bribed with gold and unaffected by human rank, we shall be judged by motives. When all the dust that clouds our mortal eyes is washed away, and we see clearly as God sees, it may be that those whose motives we would have condemned will appear earth's greatest heroes ; and characters pronounced evil by human judg-ment, will, like ''gold tried in the fire," be found perfect and purified. CHANGED BY BEHOLDING. BY C. G. EELSEA. (Battle Creek, Mich.) IT is said that Sandow, the celebrated " strong " man, has attained such a degree of physical perfection as to be able to control at will any muscle in his body. Of the method employed to. arrive at this condition, he says of himself, in the New York Itforning Journal: Š "Years ago when I was a boy, with my father I visited Milan, and there, in the art galleries I found the model I desired to copy. Day after day I visited the model, each time studying a new muscle or a new bump. Before long, I had photographed that statue so firmly on my mind that I could bring it before my gaze at will, and it was my only trainer during my hours of exercise." Is there not a suggestion here for the Chris-tian? His model is Jesus Christ, and as he studies his perfect character, day by day new beauties will be unfolded to his understanding, until by continually "looking unto Jesus," he is "changed into the same image from glory to glory." But if Sandow had contented himself with merely looking at his model, as something beautiful to behold, and had not endeavored to develop in himself those muscles so much ad-mired in the model, he could never have attained to the same perfection. But as he studied his model day after day, and that, too, with such zeal and earnestness that he photographed it upon his mind, he exercised his muscles until finally he reproduced in himself a perfect like-ness of his model. So it is with the Christian in studying the di-vine ModelŠChrist. If he sees in him simply a beautiful character in the abstract, and does not make any effort to become conformed to his image, he will never be like him. Not that by his own unaided efforts the Christian can make himself like Christ, but he must choose to be like him, and fight the good fight of faith in the continual surrendering of self to the transform-ing touch of the mighty hand of God. "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." Then, if Christ is studied with a de-sire to be like him, the traits of his perfect character will be photographed, as it were, upon the heart, and manifested in the life of the Christian. As we are changed by beholding, it naturally follows, also, that if one allows the mind to be-come diverted from the divine pattern, and dwell upon the' perfections or imperfections of others, he will partake in a greater or less degree of their characteristics. nut Jesus says, "Learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart." By "looking unto Jesus" we shall be transformed in character, and under the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness may indeed show Forth the praises of him who bath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. " But we all, with open face beholding  as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." AGAINST THE DAY OF WRATH. BY ELIZABETH ROSSER. (Fruitland, Oregon.) Go, ye rich of earth, lament ye, for your misery to come; For the souls of men by you are bought and sold; But the angels write your record in the ledger of the Lord,Š All the story of your crimes is there retold. And the poor beneath oppression have lifted up their voice, And the Lord to them a listening ear has turned; And to you he sends a message, "For your misery lament, Ye are heaping up your treasure to be burned." There are scores of pale-faced widOws early laboring and late, Toiling far into the night with aching head; There are maidens ruined, ruined, for the needs you might supply; There are children dying for the want of bread; But their cry has reached to heaven, and the Lord will judge their cause ; He pitieth the poor whom ye have spurned; But for you who lived in pleasure he sends this word to-day, "Ye are heaping up your treasure to be burned." There are hands in heathen countries reaching out to you for help; There are eyes which turn toward you for the light; But ye grasp your treasure tighter, and ye turn a heed-less ear, While their feeble star of hope goes out in night. But the Lord will look with mercy on the darkened heathen's sin, And his blood upon your head will be returned ; And to you he sends a message, "For your misery lament, Ye are heaping up your treasure to be burned." Angels bright are bending o'er you; mercy's voice is pleading still, While she holds above your head the crown of life ; But your hands have grasped the muck-rake, and your eyes are on the earth, While for riches ye engage in wicked strife. But the Lord is coming, coming, ye shall see his glory soon, Ye shall see the Lord of Life, whom ye have scorned; And your riches will condemn you in that dread and awful day,Š "Ye are heaping up your treasure to be burned." MODERN HAMANS. BY ELDER II. E. ROBINSON. (New York Oity.) [THE circumstances described in the following article have already been alluded to, but this statement is more comprehensive.-- En.] Occasionally men who attempt to injure others bring down on their own heads the evil conse-quences of their acts. A case of this kind has recently occurred in Maryland, and it makes "quite a break in the high-handed outrages that have gone unpunished in that State. Readers of the REVIEW have seen reports of the persecu-tion Sabbath-keepers have suffered during the past few years. So bold had the mobs become, that they did not fear to do lawless acts and make violent threats. One lesson at least has now been taught them in an unexpected manner. A few days ago brethren Jones and Howard took their tent from near Annapolis to Kent Isl-and, Md., where they had secured a lot on which to pitch it, at a village called Stevensville, three miles from the wharf of the Chester River Steam-boat Company. While brother Jones stayed by a portion of the goods on the wharf, brother Howard with his family went with one load to the lot, and began to put up his small tent. A rough crowd of men soon collected, and by threats and personal violence prevented the work from going forward. Night was at hand, rain was falling, and the situation was gloomy. Finally one man opened his house for brother Howard  and his family to find shelter for the night. In the meantime,. the driver of the team engaged to bring the goods, was afraid to return for the portion left behind, and so brother Jones re-mained on guards all night, not knowing what had happened at the other end of the 'line. Early in the morning brother Howard went to the dock, and together they consulted what course to take. Again leaving brother Jones to guard the property, brother Howard started for Middle-town, Del., to confer with the president of the Conference. It was nearly night when the- journey was finished, partly on foot, some of the way by horse, and the rest by rail. After receiving advice to lay the matter before the sheriff of the county, and ask for protection in erecting the tent, he returned to Kent Island. Aid was promised for the next morning by the sheriff, and with the aid of several brethren from the Ford's Store church, the tent was put up. For some reason the sheriff did not appear that day, and again the little band was sur-rounded by a gang of men bent on mischief. Sev-eral ropes were cut, notwithstanding the watch kept that day and the following night. About that time a committee waited on the brethren, and represented that they were leading men and voiced the sentiment of all the people in that district. They said the tent could not stay in that community, and they offered to take the goods back to the wharf, free of charge, and refund the money paid for the lot ; otherwise there would be trouble. The brethren agreed to submit the matter to the officers of the Conference, and hostilities were to cease till a reply could be received. After considerable hesitation, the committee gai,e their names and withdrew. Shortly after this, the sheriff and his deputy came (sn the ground, and were told of the visit of the com-mittee. On learning that they had left their names, he announced his determination to arrest every one. Summoning them before him, they were informed that they had made themselves liable to arrest, and that he purposed to take them back with him to Centerville, the county seat. Finally he consented to take the leader, the local magistrate, before brethren Jones and Howard, and let them decide their fate. The ministers of course said that they did not wish to have the men prosecuted, and so they were let go with a warning that if a single act of violence was committed against the tent or any person connected with it, these same gentlemen would be held responsible for it. The result was that the committee then had the task of protecting the tent from injury by others, lest they should be charged with the crime. While our ministers sweetly slept, their late enemies had to sit up and watch, that no harm was done to them or the tent. We do not suppose they enjoyed the task, but they dared not to relinquish their vigi-lance. It is needless to say that "public senti-ment" represented by them rapidly changed in favor of the preachers. While still sensitive under their defeat, they received an answer to the proposition from the offi-cers of the Conference, saying the terms were rejected, and that we would not be bribed nor intimidated into a surrender of our God-given rights to preach the gospel in any part of the world. They were therefore advised to assist in quelling any disturbance that might arise against us in our legitimate Work This they are now compelled to do, for the lofty purpose of escap-ing fines or imprisonment for themselves Ševen if they do not care to be martyrs for any higher object. I gladly commend the sheriff of Queen Anne county, who certainly took vigorous measures to defend us on Kent Island. I hope this experi-ence will for a time restrain a little of the mob element in that locality. Kent Island is the place where Elder Joseph Bates was threatened with a ride on a rail in, the early days of the Ines-
