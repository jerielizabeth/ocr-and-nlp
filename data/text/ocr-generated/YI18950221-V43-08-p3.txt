FEBRUARY 21, 1895. THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 59 GROWTH OF INDUSTRIAL LIFE. 4.Š MONEY. MONEY has two uses. It must have both these uses to some extent, or it is not money ; and whatever does have these two uses in any community, is money. If any one wishes to tell what the value of an article is, he says that it is worth so and so much money. Everything which may be bought and sold has its value measured in this way. Money, therefore, is a measure of value. If one person wishes to exchange a buggy for a horse belonging to a second person, he finds out what his buggy is worth in money, and what the horse is worth in money, and if the two are worth about the same amount, an even exchange is made. But if the owner of the buggy could not find a horse for which he could trade, he might sell it to some one who wanted a carriage, and so get money enough to buy himself a horse from another man. This is the other use of money. Money is a medium of exchange, as well as a measure of values. It is something which every one will give and take in exchange for what he does not wish to keep, because every one who takes money for what he has, knows that he can trade it for what he wants. In the manorial village, the first use of money was almost its only use. While the value of the labor-dues was often set down in the accounts, real money was rarely used. Direct barter of one thing for another and of commodities for work, was the usual form of exchange. Only the strolling peddlers and thedid a money business. In the time of the guilds, money was used for making sales and purchases ; that is, it had come to be a medium of exchange in the every-day life of the English people. But it was only an instrument and a tool. No one who produced tried to get money, for itself, but only for the comforts which money repre-sented. For generations, the prices remained almost uniform, controlled by the guilds, and only so much was produced as the community needed. These goods were sold simply for what they were supposed to be worth. No goods were ever left on the hands of the maker. There were no panics, no dull times. There could not be; for there was just so large a market, and it was always only even full, and never choked. Nor could there be times of scarcity ; for nobody ever held anything back for better prices, simply because prices were always the same. All persons who live only on a salary are still using money merely as it was used then. It is for them simply a medium of exchange. If a clerk asks for a raise of salary, it is not usually the money in itself that he desires, but the better living which it will insure him. Work is exchanged against money, and that against needed commodities. With the product of labor it is no longer so. Money is now an end in itself. It is invested in labor, and in machines to make labor more productive, and all in order that the product of labor may be turned again into more money. This new power which money has acquired, of making more money, has changed the whole order of industrial life. Money  which is thus used to produce money is called capital. We shall see that capital has altered completely the conditions of labor ; has trans-ferred it from the life of the guild to the life of the factory,Š and it is no wonder that labor has a collision with it now and then. The discovery of America had much to do in bringing about the change in the use of money. The opening up of a new world and the discovery of a water passage around the Cape of Good Hope to India, tempted forth those bold merchant-adventurers, of whom Sir Francis Drake is a type Š wild buccaneers Šmerchants at home, pirates abroad. With the gold and silver of the new world they bought their cargoes of European wares, and traded them in India, in Africa, and in America, for silks, for ivory, and for furs ; then returned to Europe and reaped princely gains from the sale of their outland merchan-dise. Thus the idea of seeking profit Š of sell-ing commodities for the highest price they can be made to bring, regardless of their cost Š was introduced to the business world. Men in every vocation where such a thing could be done, began to seek for some way of giving one shil-ling to get two ; and as a final result, money, from being servant, became master. It was no longer merely a "common drudge 'tween man and man," but a genius powerful enough to create great factories, to cover the sea with ships and the land with railways, to bless and prosper, or to blast and ruin, with but a change of countenance. The development of a new relation between money and trade reacted on the coin. Up to about the time of Elizabeth there had been a steady sinking in the real value of the coin. The pieces decreased in size and in purity. Clipping of the coin was very common, and no one seemed to object to it. Indeed, when Elizabeth prohibited clipping the coin with heavy penalties, the law was looked upon as a most uncalled-for injustice. Yet the chief rob-bers were the kings themselves. When in need of funds, they coined the money of the realm in more pieces than the proper weight of ster-ling metal would make, making up the shortage with baser metal,Š copper, tin, or lead. The pound sterling was originally twelve ounces of silver. Wear of coins reduced this in the course of four centuries so much that the coins which should make a pound were found to weigh but eight ounces. Then came the idea of seigniorage, or royal meddling with the coin, and in twenty years the weight of a pound sterling was only six ounces. Finally Henry VIII reduced it to only two ounces. But all this depreciation in money did not alter prices at all. For most purposes leather coins would have answered fully as well. Anything which would serve to make ex-changes would do ; all that was necessary was that men should take it at a certain fixed and uniform value. When money became an object in itself, the effect of the debasement was felt at once. The prices which were gaged to money of twelve ounces to the pound, would not an-swer when money was of only one sixth that value. A reform of the coinage was called for, and in the reign of Elizabeth the weight of the pound was fixed at four ounces, and counterfeiting and clipping were prohibited. C. B. MORRILL. WHETHER any particular day shall bring to you more of happiness or of suffering is largely beyond your power to determine. Whether each day of your life shall give happiness or suffering, rests with yourself. THE EASTERN QUESTION. PART II.Š THE OTTOMAN POWER. FROM northern Africa the followers of Mo-hammed went into Spain, where they were called Moors. They built beautiful palaces there, one of which, the Alhambra, is very celebrated. Washington Irving has written a book about it, which you may sometime like to read. You will then learn that they were very wonderful people, when they were not fighting. They lived there hundreds of years. Boabdil, their last king, was conquered by Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic sovereigns who sent Columbus off on his voyage of discovery. But we will go back to Jerusalem ; and we find that some fierce Tartar tribes, called the Seljuk Turks, had become so zealous in their religion that they wrested Jerusalem from the Saracen rulers, and began to persecute and kill the Christians who made pilgrimages to the Holy Sepulcher, and threateningly advanced toward Constantinople, the Christian seat of empire. Then great armies from all over Europe marched or sailed to defend and recover the holy places. These wars are called the Cru- sades. They began in ro96 A. D. The stories of these wars, of the knights and their deeds of chivalry, are very interesting. The children, even,. went on crusades. Longfellow, in allu- sion to this time, has written a pretty poem, the " Children's Crusade," which you will like to find and read. Well, the Seljuk Turks were prevented from taking Constantinople, but the Christians could not retain Jerusalem, although they did get possession of it for awhile. After a time the Ottoman Turks, an offshoot of the Seljuk Turks (these are all Mohamme-dans in religion), gradually established a sovereignty, and seized province after province from the Christians in Asia. They besieged Constantinople, and finally conquered and took it. That was in 1453 A. D. They es- tablished their seat of empire there, and have kept it to the present day. Their ruler is called the Sultan. They are not a very highly civilized people,Š nothing like the Moors. There was great dismay in Europe when Constantinople fell ; for it seemed as if the conquerors might make the whole world Mo-hammedan, but that was not to be. The Hungarian warriors and Knights of St. John checked the Turkish advance, so that they had to be content with Turkey and Greece in Europe. But they have several times since tried to conquer the European continent. About one hundred years after this, Philip II of Spain tried to compel the Moors to give up their native language, to give their children Christian names, and send them to Christian (Catholic) schools. There was a great revolt at this, which he suppressed by depopulating the fairest provinces of Spain. He also sent a fleet into the Mediterranean against the Turks who had captured Cyprus. It was an immense fleet, similar to his " Invincible Armada" which he sent against England a few years later. They met the Turkish squadrons in the Gulf of Lepanto on the western coast of Greece in 1571. The battle which followed was unequaled by anything the Mediterranean had seen since the naval encounters of the Romans and Carthaginians in the first Punic war. The Ottoman fleet was almost totally destroyed. Thus the battle of Lepanto holds an important place in history ; for it marks the turning-point of the long struggle between the Mohammedans and Christians, which had now been going on for nearly a thousand years. The Turks never recovered their former power and prestige. LORETTA REISMAN.
