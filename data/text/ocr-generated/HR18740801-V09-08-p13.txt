THE HEALTH REFORMER. 237 The Magic of an Auctioneer's Advertisement. THE Building News, London, is responsible for the following :Š An English country gentleman recently be-came tired of his house, and determined to sell it. He instructed an acutioneer, famous for his descriptive powers, to advertise it in the pa-pers for private sale, but to conceal the location, telling persons to apply at his office. In a few days the gentleman happened to see the adver-tisement, was pleased with the account of the place, shoved it to his wife, and the two con-cluded it was just what they wanted, and that they would secure it at once. So he went to the office of the auctioneer and told him the place he had advertised was such a one as he desired, and he would purchase it. The auc-tioneer burst into a laugh, and told him that that was the description of his own house, where he was then living. He read the advertisement again, pondered over the " grassy slopes," "beautiful vistas," " smooth lawn,"etc., ad broke out, " Is it possible I Well, make out my bill for advertising and expenses, for, I wouldn't sell the place now for three times what it cost me." AM. A Move in the Right Direction. THE subject of health and dress reform is at the present time engaging the attention of many. He who carefully, in the light of science and reason, observes the dietetic habits and the mode of dress adopted by the masses, will at once recognize the necessity of a radical change. No king or queen, even in the palmiest days of the great universal empires of earth, ever swayed a mightier influence over their subjects than dame fashion does at the present time over her votaries. She speaks, and almost every one of the fair sex becomes a willing slave. She waves her scepter, and nearly all bow in sub-mission. A few have moral courage enough to raise their voice against her tyranny. They have taken a noble stand in defense of the right, and boldly declare that " trailing dresses," corsets, and other articles of fashionable dress too numerous to mention, are fruitful means of impairing health and shortening life. The in-fluence of the efforts of the earnest few who have labored so untiringly to bring about a re-form in regard to dress is being felt in the most fashionable circles. That such is the case, let the following facts, which recently appeared in the Inter-Ocean, of Chicago, testify :Š "HYGIENIC DRESS. " The ladies of New York and Brooklyn have been treated to several courses of lectures dur-ing the past season from female physicians. The  main scope of these lectures has been to show that right modes of life and dress will insure sound health without the aid of medicine ; that headaches and backaches, and all the ills that result from violations of plain hygienic laws, are a physical disgrace to the sex. As the be-ginning of a reform in these matters, a change in the modes of dress among women is earnest-ly insisted on. The corset is singled out as the scape-goat for a large number of disorders and diseases that affect the female sex, and it is laid down as physical law and gospel that there shall be neither weight nor compression about the waist. Women have just as many muscles about the back as men have, and those muscles can be made, if rightly managed, to sustain the body in an erect position without any aid from steel or whalebone. " In the mode of dress proposed by Mrs. Ev-erett, and which many ladies have tried for years and totally approve, the entire dress is sustained by the shoulders, and there is no more compression or weight about the waist than in the dress of men. The first garment, and that worn next to the body, is of English canton flannel, high in the neck, long in the sleeve, and reaching to the ankle. It consists of a waist with a broad belt, to which drawers are firmly sewed. The second garment is of muslin, and made nearly in the same way. On this may or may not be worn, according to one's taste, the ordinary chemise. Next comes the hoop, to which is sewed a pair of common suspenders. Over this is worn a light muslin skirt ; felts, balmo-rals, and quilted skirts, are tabooed as heavy, unnecessary, and unhealthy. Then comes the dress skirt, sewed to a thin waist, so that its weight also depends from the shoulders. The basque, polonaise, or redingote, completes the costume. The feet are to be covered with a cotton stocking, thick in winter and thin in summer, which is drawn over the garment next the person, and fastened at the knee by a safety pin, which keeps it in place without an elastic. From September to June slippers are to be locked up in our treasure chests, and thick shoes be worn in the house and in the street. This point is insisted on as of great importance, since headaches, coughs, and many other ills, can be traced directly to cold feet. In winter, a merino vest is worn beneath the canton flan-nel, and during the heated term, either thin canton flannel or gauze is worn next the per- son. The amount of dress should always be adjusted to the temperature. Every garment worn during the day should be removed at night, and placed where the air can have free access to it. A thorough Sunni g and blowing in the wind will often prove as cleansing as im-mersion in boiling water. Some of the most fashionable women in New York and Brooklyn have adopted this un-der dress, and are delights with the perfect
