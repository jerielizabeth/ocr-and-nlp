THE HEALTH REFORMER. 227 ultimate atoms are all alike. Even the most offensive forms of matter are very useful in their proper sphere. It is only when matter is misplaced, or is left to accumulate in some improper place, that it becomes dirt. But we do not wish to dwell longer upon dirt in general, as the subject is too large for present attention. Personal cleanliness is our theme ; and by the term personal cleanliness we do not wish to include all that might be said about soiled cravats, dirty collars, dingy cloaks, or smutty aprons ; we desire to call attention to the care of that beautiful and flexible article of clothing which, though differing somewhat in texture and color in various localities, is usually made after about the same pattern, and is not very much affected by the vicissitudes of fash-ion ; viz., the skin, or epidermis. The skin, the superficial covering of the -whole body, everywhere abounds in little mouths or openings called pores. There are more than 2,000,000 of these openings upon the surface of the body. Each one is the ex-ternal orifice of a capillary tube which acts as a kind of sewer to convey away dead, effete, and decomposing matter from the body. Each of these purifying organs is constantly at work unless its mouth gets obstructed in some way. They are especially active in the summer sea-son when the weather is warm, pouring out large quantities of perspiration in which the offensive matters are held in solution. Now let us see what takes place if we pay no attention to the natural clothing with which we have been kindly provided. The sweat or insensible perspiration, with a load of im-purities, is poured out of 2,000,000 little sew-ers, upon the surface of the body. The watery portion evaporates, leaving behind all the foul matter which it contained, which adheres to the skin. This is what occurs the first day. The next day an equal quantity is deposited in the same way, making with the previous de-posit a thin film of dirt covering the skin. The third day the quantity has augmented to the consistency of varnish. The fourth day the person becomes cempletely encased in a quad-ruple layer of organic filth. By the fifth day fermentation begins and an unsavory and pun-gent odor is developed. The sixth day adds new material to the accumulating pollution, and still further increases the intensity of the es-caping effluvia. Upon the seventh day a climax of dirtiness is reached. The penetrating,  pungent fetor becomes intolerable. The person feels as though he had been bathed in mucil-age or molasses. When he approaches his more cleanly friends, they look around to see if there is not some fragment of carrion adhering to his boot. But the individual him-self is unconscious of any unpleasant odor, his nose having become accustomed to the stench ; or if he recognizes it, he flatters himself that as no one can see the condition of his cuticle he will escape detection. Vain delusion. Every person whose organ of smell is not wholly ob-literated by snuff or catarrh, will single him out as quickly as a dog detects the exact local-ity of a weasel. The above is a description of the process as it occurs in summer, under the sudorific influ-ence of such weather as July and August afford us. In the winter, the process is less rapid, requiring three or four weeks instead of one, unless the person occupies a heated room; but the ultimate result is just the same in either case. How often must a person bathe in order to keep his skin clean and himself free from any offensive odor ? Just so often as he becomes dirty. He should not wait until he becomes so odoriferous with souring, putrifying excreta that he is not only a nuisance to his associates, but a disgust to himself. The first trace of odor is not an evidence of dirt merely, but of dirt which has been so long retained that it has become rotten. Some years ago, we saw a man who boast-ed (!) that a drop of water had not touched his back for nearly thirty years. Think what must have been the condition of such an epi-dermis. Happily for us, we met him on a cold' day, so that our olfactories were not so greatly shocked as they might otherwise have been. That such a condition of things is not very un-common, was once demonstrated to us by the disgusting revelations of a bath man at one of the fashionable mineral-spring resorts. He readily concurred in our expressed opinion that the remarkable effects attributed to the water were mainly due to its cleansing properties when accompanied by a little good soap. It is no uncommon thing for a person to be so untidy in his habits that he acquires a peculiar odor, by which his more intimate friends could easily recognize him in the darkest night. In the winter, one or two general baths each week will usually be sufficient to keep a person
