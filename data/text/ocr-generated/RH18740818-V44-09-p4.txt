68 ADVENT REVIEW AND HERALD OF THE SABBATH. Vol. 44, No. 9. ulaneti(J them through thy Truth ; Thy Word Is truth." BATTLJI CltBEX:, MIOH., THI:B.D-DAY, AUG. 18, 1874. JAMES WffiTE, J. N. ANDREWS, URIAH SMITH. EDITORS. Camp-Meeting Notings. THIS number of the REviEW having been layed one week on account of the camp-meeting just held in this place, the reader will be ing some notice of the meeting. An attempt to describe the meeting involves much the same ficulties that would be met in attempting to scribe a sumptuous feast. We could speak of the different dishes and viands ; we could describe to some extent the different courses ; we could refer to the good cheer, and tell how excellent were the various articles ; and yet from all that, the reader would get but a very poor idea of the enjoyments of the occasion. To fully appreciate them, he must have been present, and for himself partaken of the good things provided. So with the meeting: those only who pated in it, can fully appreciate its blessings. Some of the most precious seasons which many if not all upon the camp-ground ever enjoyed, were experienced during this meeting. Statistically the sum of the matter can soon be told. There were ten!:s_Q!! the ground, which, one brother to ascertain, contained over 24,500 square feet of canvas. The number of Sabbath-keepers manently encamped was between twelve and teen-hy,J,ldred with. many in dairfattendai'lce who iodged away from the ground. But to the discredit of the Michigan Conference it must be said, only thirty-six. churches, out of over sixty belonging to the Conference, had representatives on the ground. When it was decided to receive as delegates any who might be present from churches that had sent no regularly appointed delegates, it was ascertained that only the number above named were represented. That is to say, from over twenty-four churches of this Conference not a representative could be found in that large company of Sabbath-keepers. Had all the es done as well as those which did take part in the meeting, there would have been at least two sand Sabbath-keepers present. This ought not to have been as it was ; and we hope a like failure will not again ooour. Those who did not come realize not what they have lost. During the eleven days of the meeting five discourses were given, six by Bro. White, five each by Brn. Butler and Andrews, and sister White, three by Bro. Haskell, and one by Bro. L. C. Rogers, delegate from the S. D. Baptists. The word was spoken with great power and ness. Especially was the speaking of Bro. White thus characteriz.ed throughout. Never, we lieve, did he make better points, or present the great truths of this message with msre clearness and force. And the involuntary response of many hearts was, Thank God for the freedom he gives his servant, and the physical strength that is granted for the ardent labors into which his troth-inspired soul is constantly leading him. The same may be said of sister White, Bro. ler, and others. The Lord signally helped his servants. Oh! the burning words, the stirring peals, the thrilling truths t If all could live out what was taught, and which from its self-evident truthfulness wrought conviction in the heart, they would not be far from the kingdom of Heaven, and following on in the well-directed way, would be sure of eternal life at the journey's end. The social meetings were generally precious seasons. There was some backwardness at first in taking hold earnestly of the work, but the brethren soon began to feel more fully the ance of the occasion, and tak.e a more lively est in it. The Spirit of the Lord often rested down to that degree that many of the tion were melted into tenderness and tears. Three times a call was made for those who 
sired to start anew in the service of God to come forward. The first time about two hundred and fifty came, the second and third times, between three and four hundred, there being many ward in the last who were not in the others, so that probably more than four hundred persons thus manifested their purpose to start anew in the Christian life. With many of these, this was their first public movement in the service of God. Of one of those occasions the reporter for the troit Post thus spoke :-" A remarkable and thrilling scene took place during the afternoon. After Elder Butler had closed his discourse Mrs. Ellen G. White mediately occupied the stand, and, although her eloquence and persuasive powers were well known by the audience, still they were unprepared for the powerful and unanswerable appeal which she made. She seemed indeed almost inspired as she implored sinners to flee from their sins. The effect of her magnetic speech and manner was most remarkable. Probably 300 came forward for prayers, and it seemed as if the early days of Methodism had returned again. There is no denying the fact that the entire simplicity and singleness of purpose of this peculiar people are having great cfl'ect on those even who scoff at their belief." The extension of time to eleven days was ly. It would have been impossible to hold all the business sessions without it. The Michigan Conference, Health Institute, General Conference, Publishing Association, and Michigan Tract ciety, held the several sessions necessary to act their business. All passed off harmoniously and with a good degree of interest. The reports of their doings, will be published next week. The presence of Eld. L. C. Rogers, delegate to our General Conference from the S. D. Baptist General Conference, added interest to the occasion. His discourse on the 8th, from 1 Cor. 15 : 57, 58, was a masterly effort, and an illustration of how high culture can be happily combined with nest piety and vital godliness. His remarks to the Conference Wednesday morning, the 12th, just previous to his departure, as he was not able to remain to the close of the meeting, were very happy and cordial, and were heartily received by the large congregation present. And there were some encouraging incidents which were wholly unexpected, and therefore the more calculated to impress the mind as indications that the Lord is signally working in this cause. Bro . .J. B. Frisbie, who has long stood aloof from the work, involved in darkness and doubt, having started for Kansas, intending there to locate, thought he would stop a day or two at the meeting. As the time drew near when he was intending to leave, the Spirit of the Lord seemed to work upon his mind, and he concluded to main. He sent for his wife, who joined him here and both remained to the close. He made, at different times, very warm and impressive marks, stating his desires to return to this people, and resume his former position ; but he desired to come back right. His numerous friends, many of whom had in former years received the truth from his hands, were rejoiced at his words. May the Lord lead him all the way up again into the light of his countenance and the joy of his tmth. Bro. Geo. W. Wright, also, who, from for and unjust trials brought upon him in the past, had been turned away to labor with another people, unexpectedly to us came upon the ground and remained to the close. He spoke words of friendship and good cheer, to which all felt that it was good to listen. l\Iay the Lord help and guide him in all his future course. Sister Roby Tuttle, who has for some time bored as a public speaker among the first-day ventists, and who the past season, attended our school in Battle Creek, was also unexpectedly present, and publicly took her stand in favor of the Sabbath. Thus the cause gathers strength, and God is giving increase to his work. The parting meeting Monday morning was a season of interest. At its conclusion, E. H. Root, E. R. Jones, and U. Smith, were ordained to the work of the ministry. After this we repaired a short distance to a pleasant spot on the banks of the Kalamazoo River, and sixty-two believers went forward in the ordinance of baptism, Brn. White and Andrews being the ·administrators. It was a solemn and impressive scene. We have now reached a point from which we can look back over the meeting as a thing of the past ; an!l we put the question to our own heart, For how much would you be willing that the work of this meeting should be undone? And no :figures can express a sufficient sum. A rious work has been wrought, the value of which is beyond We believe all present felt that it well repaid them for the time they spent, and the trouble and expense they incurred in attending the meeting; or, rather, that the time could not be better employed, and that the efforts were no trouble, and the means used could hardly be called expense, when it made such magnificent returns. There was nothing ous or fanatical about the meeting, but a strong conviction of tmth, and a sweet influence tending to unite and cement together all hearts. We pect its results will be glorious, as its memories will be ever pleasant. u. s. What Thirty Years Have Proved. p,iav rJa(3(3a:rc.;v otl\Iatt. 28: 1, the first Sabbath of a new series? Let us suppose as they claim that.-TmRTY years ago this present season, the tbe old series, the Jewish Sabbaths, as they caU great body of Adventists were a unit, and the them, there ended, and the 
first of the new series; proclamation of the near·coming of the Lord was the Christian Sabbaths, Sunday, was there going with unparalleled power through the land. traduced. This was at the time of the Not a heart doubted that God was in the move-tion of Christ. ment; for on no other ground could what they felt and what they saw, be accounted for. In unity, and strength, and love, and power, all moved on together to the point of expectation in the autumn of year. Disappointed in their hope, as the time passed and the Lord did not come, the scene of sion that followed baffled description ; and the discordant views and theories that immediately arose could not easily be catalogued. It was nothing strange that uncertainty should for a while reign supreme in many minds. But it was certain that time would test the various schemes of interpretation devised ; and it was to be sumed that that which was the truth would soon begin to assume definite proportiomo, would begin to make its way steadily among the people, and would prove permanent in its nature. Thirty years have elapsed. Time enough has been given to test the truthfulness and bility of every theory and every movement ; and as we survey the field to-day what do we behold? Over a large portion of the Adventist body, the original confusion still reigns. Theory after ry has been devised which a few years have proved to be faise and worthless. Movement after ment has been set on foot, which in a brief son has run its course and perished. But one movement appears which has been steady and onward in its progress, one theory which has stood, and grown stronger with yeara and investigation. That is the cause of the third angel's message, as advocated by Seventh-day ventists. Of all the periodicals that have been started since in advocacy of other views, some, after running an ignominiously short race, have disappeared, and others, after a few years had proved their position untenable, changed their course, and in their subsequent teaching contradicted their first. And not once or twice only have some of them changed. but their ersets have continued till they finally have no position, but present to the world a heterogeneous mass of incongruous and conflicting views. How has it been with the REVIEW? Its teaching has been the same from beginning to end. Its articles of twenty-five years ago read, in sentiment, the same as its articles of to-day. The views it advocates have increased in clearness and strength from year to year. It has not been one thing to-day and another to-morrow, a gross take one year and some new devici to cover it up the next. But the movement has steadily grown in power, and the cause has gone forward with accelerating progress. And now there are weeklies and four monthlies published in its fense, which all speak the same thing, and are all laboring to one end. Never did the cause present such evidences of strength and nency as it presents to-day The experience of these thirty years is of estimable value. It fills a place which nothing else could fill ; for however plausible a theory may look when :first promulgated, the objection that time may prove it false can be refuted only by time itself. This objection time has rem·oved in reference to our movement. No one need now enter into this work with a feeling that it is an experiment. These thirty years of tion, of closest scrutiny, and every form and phase of opposition, have proved that the trines of S. D. Adventists are well grounded, and will stand. Thus has time developed in this cause such features of truthfulness as no other movement in the ranks of Adventists is able to show. And it is destined to culminate in that triumph which God has ordained for his word and his truth. u. s. That Greek Prop for Snnday. A CORRESPONDENT of the A. C. Times writes to that paper that " one who claims to be a Greek scholar " says Matt. 28 : 1 
should read "after the last Sabbath, early on the first bath," &c., and asks for light. In reply the Times anchors itself on the claim so long ago exploded, that one series of Sabbaths there ended and another commenced. It says : " The idea seems to be that it was a time when one Sabbath was patt and another was begining." Are our friends aware how many new series of 8abbaths they are introducing by maldng the We now come down to the year 59, when Paul· met with the disciples at Troas, Acts 20 : 7, and we find the.same expression again used. On the p,1ii Twv rJaf3(3ciwv, when the disciples came together. to break bread. Now if ,uiav aa(311aT(,)t' in 1\'Iatt. 28: 1 denotes the begining of a new series of Sabbaths there, the same expression in Acts 20 : 7· denotes the begining of a new series here, many years later. What series was this? If the ries of Sunday Sabbath commenced at the rection of Christ what other series commenced in.. A. D. 59 ? Will they tell us ? Again, in 1 Cor. lG: 2 we find another p,iaj) aa/3/36.mv, upon which the disciples were directed to lay by their liberalities. Here is a new date and a new series. ·what series was this, and' what has become of it ? If the Greek of the New Testament proves anywhere the introduction of one new series of Sabbaths, it proves the duction of at least three new series ; and if one of these is to be taken up and observed, on this. ground, the others should also be, or good reason· be given why they should not be so o.bserved. But aside from this fact, which is sufficient of itself to annihilate this argument, the attempt to establish a new Sabbath from the expression in Matt. 28: I, betrays a very deficient acquaintance with the Greek language. The reader is ferred to the little tract published at this Office, entitled '' Sabbaton," for a full explanation of the Greek of )fatt. 28 : 1, and parallel passages. L. s. Thoughts on Chnrch 3. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHl'RCH. IN using the word organization I mean pally a description of the structure, or different parts, of which the church is composed, as revealed. to us in the New Testament. In every important enterprise, organization is found to be a necessity. As one individual cannot act in every sphere, it is found expedient to assign to each his duty, and' thus avoid confusion and laboring at poses. More can be accomplished in this ner than to leave it wholly indefinite when each shall act. In enterprises in which many it should be the desire and effort of all to plish as much for the common purpose as possible. Hence the propriety of organization. In such a vast machine as the government of the nation, or the army, what could be done out it? It is found necessary in society, and in every public institution. It enables all the parts to act harmoniously for a common object. haps the most complete system of organization that exists anywhere among men is found in the army. Every man has his special duty assigned him, and just how he shall do it. One mind, perhaps, moves a million men. At a word they are all in motion. The perilous and fearful sponsibilities of war make it necessary that power should be exercised by one man, because it is found to be most effective. If any one doubts the effectiveness of organization, let him conceive of putting down our great rebellion without it. Had each man of our vast army started out on his own hook, most of them would have never reached the South at all. They could not have been properly armed, fed, clothed, or trained. Disease would have fed upon them, and the whole country through which they passed would have been strewed with their corpses. And had a portion of them reached the' South, it would have been mere play for the Southern forces to have routed them. But ized, equiped, and drilled, it was quite a different matter. . Led and disciplined by minds of cient capacity, they swept the rebellion out of existence. As much wisdom should be used in the sacred work of God as in any human enterprise. Every proper means should be employed to make it effective. Therefore, God has assigned t<l his church various offices, divisions, gifts, powers, and agencies, by which it may be rendered effective in saving those who form a part of it, as well as to reach and affect those outside of it. In the first age of the Christian church, there seems to have been general councils held for sultation, answering much the same purpose as our General Conference. For instance : such as that held at Jerusalem spoken of in Acts 15 ; when the leading men came together and seled concerning things of general interest. There seems to have been also geographical subdivisions, such as the" churches of Judea," the" churches of Galabia," and also of Asia Minor, &c. We are not informed that these met for mutual tion especially; Jet they seem to have been nected by speci ties of interest and fellowship. These might well answer to our State Conferences. We know there were local churches organized in the various towns and cities, such as Jerusalem, Antioch, Corinth, Rome, &c., and elders ordained
