616 [8] THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. Vol. 20, No. 39, to vindicate the rights of the individual, and in the. general Constitution they did even dare to vindicate "the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all;" yet the several States adopting the Constitu-tion were left with the fangs of that hideous monster which has cursed the world,Ša union of religion and the State,Šfastened upon their very vitals. And each succeeding State en-tering the sisterhood of States has adopted similar laws, thereby stultifying their own constituti OES. Now these very things are brought forward by the borde"of National Reformers and Ro-man Ł Catholics as proof that a union of Church and State, or religion and the State, always has existed in this government, that this is as it should be, and-that the Constitu-tion itself teaches the same. Thus it is that they subvert, instead of guarding, the rights of the individualŠ"individuality even in re-ligion, and in religion above all." And not only so, but these laws, in the hands of igno-rance, bigotry, and superstition, entirely su-persede -the supreme laws of the State and nation. As proof of this, we look at one of the original States, Maryland, where Seventh-day Adventists are suffering loss of property, or are confined in loathsome jails,. because their individual rights in matters of religion are not respected. Their Declaration of Rights says:Š ARTICLE 36. That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such a manner as he thinks most acceptable to him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persua-sion or profession, or for his religious practice, un-less, under color of religion, he shall disturb, etc. And yet the very same section brings in a religious test, in that no person is to "be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; Provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that, under his dispensation, such a person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor, either in this world or the world to come." So, if a person does not "believe" in all this, he is not competent. And section 11, article 3, Legislative De-partment, reads:Š No minister or preacher of the gospel, or of any religious creed or denomination, . . . shall be eligible as senator or delegate. Thus in one line they declare for freedom for all men,.and in the next place a barrier in the way of that freedom, or else a bid to a man to stifle his Own convictions. But this glaring inconsistency is made more apparent, as we examine their Sunday laws. Not only does the State constitution, as we .have seen, declare in preference of the man who pro-fesses faith in God (and in this we see a: bid for hypocrisy), but the State declares in favor of the. "Lord's day" as the Sabbath, which, of course, is true; but it says that the day is "commonly called Sufiday." And it-says that no person having children or servants "shall command or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day;" nor were these "to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting," under a penalty of five dollars. Engaging in trade or sale of various kinds of merchandise is. deemed as Sabbath breaking, and punish-able by a fine of from $20 to $50, while other so-called offenses are punishable by heavier fines and imprisonment, as, for ex-ample, a man is to be imprisoned from three  months to one year if he shall catch oysters on Sunday. Another example of this glaring inconsist-ency may be seen by examination of Georgia's "Declaration of Fundamental Principles":Š SECTION 1. Protection of person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete. And yet, in this State, under cover of her Sunday laws, a minister of the gospel, and a teacher in a school, both Seventh-day Ad-ventists, are held to answer at court for work-ing in the rear of a school building, with saw and hammer, on Sunday, like offenses(?) of which are often witnessed, but without ar- rest. Ł But all this is done in face of the follow- ing :Š SECTION. 6. Perfect freedom of - religious sentiment shall be, and the same is hereby secured, and no inhab-itant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property . . . on account of his religious opinion. And yet the penalty for violation of her Sunday laws is very severe. Persons con-victed "shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain gang on the public works . . . not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these pun-ishments may be ordered in the discretion of the judge." So that if the judge should be a bigot, he could impose the whole list of penalties. More than this; take these men before men-tioned, who are observers of the "Sabbath day according to the commandment," should they be found guilty and be sentenced to the chain gang, their consciences would not allow them to work on the seventh day of the week; and by this refusal, they would, according to their law, "be deemed guilty of a capital of-fense, the penalty of which is. death, or such.  other punishment as the judge in his discre-tion may inflict." Thus the life of the of-fender(?) will depend altogether upon the humanity of the judge. Take, for another example, a. Northern State, lest the reader may think that such is especially peculiar to these States, and that such is not the case in the North. The "Bill of Rights" of Minnesota declares thatŠ The 'right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience shall never be in-fringed; . . . nor shall any control of or inter-ference with the rights of conscience be permitted, or any preference be given by law to any religious estab-lishment or mode of worship. Yet the Sunday laws of the State define Sunday as the sabbath, and also define sa.b-bath breaking, thus declaring in favor of a certain religious institution, and thereby giving "preference" "by law," to a certain "mode of worship," thus-contradicting and making ut-terly-void, in fact, all the guarantees of the Constitution, and making it possible to repeat the same persecutions in Minnesota as are now seen in Maryland, Tennessee, and Georgia.. Not only so, but at the last session of the Minnesota Legislature a law was enacted by which it is possible to place violators of these Sunday laws upon the streets with the chain gang. Ł And nearly every State, if not all of them, ,are in the -same predicament, declaring for perfect freedom of conscience in the supreme law of the States, Ł and denying these same principles in the statute laws. As before stated, and experience emphasizes the state-ment, these, in the hands of bigots, be-come paramount to the supreme law of the  State, while the principle of individual rights, freedom of conscience, is totally lost to sight, and the supreme law trampled in the dust. All of this but emphasizes the fact that these principles should be studied, and bet-. ter understood by the people. To this end we ask the army of readers of this paper to follow us carefully through a few papers touching this subject, not that they will be exhaustive of the subject, but we trust they may be an incentive to deeper thought. AN ILLOGICAL "INDUCTION." BY W. N. GLENN. REV. E. HANDEL JONES, of Williamstown, province of Victoria, Australia, sets forth the following proposition with the confident, air of one who deems his position impregnable:Š I take my text, the citadel of Adventism, "I came not to destroy the law or the prophets, I came not to destroy but to fulfill," and, viewed in the light of the epistles to the Romans, Galatians. Colossians, and HebrewsŠfrom their general spirit and drift I draw the following induction :Š "That the Old Testament dispensation is super-seded by the Lord Jesus Christ." It follows, there-fore 1. That the moral law, being a part of the Old Testament dispensation, is therefore fulfilled by Christ. 2. That the Jewish Sabbath being part of the moral law is consequently fulfilled by Christ. . 3. That the apostles so interpreted Christ's rela-tion to the Old Testament in general, and the moral law in particular, that they themselves practically effected the transfer from the seventh to the first day of the week. 4. That it is the will of Christ that the Jewish Sabbath as such be no longer binding; therefore, 5. Consequently we conclude that the first day of the week is divinely authorized in lieu of the Jewish Sabbath. This "induction" is illogical because it con-cludes that Christ did just what he declared that he came not to do. It is illogical because it concludes that that which is "fulfilled" is necessarily superseded and practically done away. According to the position here taken, Christ destroyed the law by fulfilling it, after declaring positively that his purpose was "not to destroy the law or the prophets." It also subpoenas "the epistles to the Romans, Galatians, Colossians, and Hebrews" as wit-nesses, and claims to prove by them that Christ did that which he came not to do. From these epistles he also draws the con-clusion that "the Old Testament dispensation is superseded by Christ." But as the former conclusion necessitates the assumption that Christ contradicted himself, we are at least suspicious of subsequent deductions from the same premise. As to Christ superseding the Old Testament dispensation, the thought is not sustained by the facts. Christ preached.  the Old Testament during his ministry. The Old Testament constituted the Scriptures in the time of Christ, and for some time after-ward. After his resurrection he opened the.  understanding of his disciples, "that they might understand the Scriptures." Ł Luke 24:45. The .disciples also preached Christ from the Old Testament, having no other Scrip- tures. See Acts 2:16-21, 30, 31; 8:26-35. The epistles cited by Mr. Jones as witnesses to his "induction" also testify to this fact. The apostle Paul tells us that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction', fur in-struction in righteousness; that the tnan of God may be perfect, thoroughly °furnished
