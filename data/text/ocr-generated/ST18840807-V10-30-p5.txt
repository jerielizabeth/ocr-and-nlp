IT is a sad reflection that there are multitudes in the visible church who are a hindrance rather than any real help or spiritual power. The enthusiasm which led them to enlist in the service of Christ has died out, and they even regret that they entered his service. If in some honorable way they could be absolved from their vows, they would gladly accept the release, and go back to their old life. Here is a question for our consideration: Is it the overwhelming majority of any particular church or the small minority that is ever ready to volunteer its services for Christ? There were twenty-two thousand of Gideon's army of thirty-two thou-sand whom God could not use, for their hearts were not wholly joined to him. But as God is searching for men of his own heart, the winnowing process is still son-tinned. The ten thousand who remain are not lacking in courage, but his service demands other qualities. -Courage is not all the Chris-tian soldier needs; there must be also prudence, watchfulness, and self-denial. It was to dis-cover these qualities that the second test was instituted. The whole army was led down in the sight of the enemy to the fountain of Hared to drink. Little things often furnish the best indications of character. So here ninety-seven hundred, either in the spirit of reckless bravado or of self-indulgence, flung themselves down on the ground and abandoned themselves to the luxury of quenching their thirst. They wore careless of danger and unthinking of surprise. It was an unsoldierly attitude. Only three hun-dred stood erect and lapped the water from their hands. They showed that duty, and not self-indulgence, was uppermost in their minds. These were the men whom God chose as his instruments. They were men of faith, courage, prudence, watchfulness, and self-denial. such men, be they few or many, God conqueN. There has always been, there is now in his church, such a minority. They are men and women of unfaltering faith, earnest prayer, and loyally ,devoted to Christ. They can be de-pended upon in emergencies. Their object is not to indulge themselves in the good of this world, but to do some good in it. They are ready for labor and count their time, their property, their all, not their own, but God's. God looks upon them with delight." As they honor him, he honors them. They are the true conquerors of the world, the pioneers in every glorious cause. They shall walk with their Lord in white, for they are worthy. The three hundred outnumbered the hosts of Midian, for God was with them. It is grand to stand with God's minorities. Better be with them than with the myriads of his enemies. Better be with them than with the large ma-jority of cowardly, half-hearted Christians whom he cannot use. Fear not, little flock, outnum-bered and despised by the world. Stand stead-fast. " It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."ŠS. J. Niccolls, D. D. MOST men feel that when they have plenty they do not need to trust God; and when they find themselves in adverse circumstances, they cannot afford to trust him. AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 469 on the facts of creation, honored by the exam-ple of Jehovah and his Son in resting on that day, sanctified for man's use by the Almighty Creator, embosomed among the ten holy pre-cepts spoken and written by God himself, kept by all the holy prophets and apostles; treat it not lightly. When its sacred light dawns upon your spiritual vision, let not the foolish fear of man control you, but "Fear God, and keep his commandments; . . . For God shall .bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." G. D. BALLOU. " I Am Afraid of the Jews." THESE words are a part of the reply which Zedekiah made to Jeremiah, when the latter had been urging him to acquiesce in the fiat of God, which had predetermined the captivity of the Jewish nation. For nearly forty years the prophet had been uttering warnings and proph-ecies in relation to their coming captivity and the overthrow of Jerusalem. The captivity had already begun some fifteen or eighteen years previous, and the kingdom of Israel had become tributary to Babylon. But Zedekiah had re-belled, and Nebuchadnezzar had besieged him in Jerusalem. At the time these words were uttered, the siege was temporarily raised on ac-count of Pharaoh having started out with his army to oppose the Chaldeans. Jeremiah con-tinued his predictions that Jerusalem would be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and exhorted the people to save their lives by going forth and giving themselves up to the hosts of Babylon and Chaldea. This was con-sidered treason, and Jeremiah was cast into a dungeon. But King Zedekiah was not yet so hardened but that he had a desire to hear what the prophet had to say further. So he sent for Jer-emiah and held a secret interview with him. Here again the prophet boldly tells the king that if he will surrender to the king of Babylon, he will save his own life and Jerusalem shall not be burned. But if he refuses to obey, Jeru-salem shall be burned with fire and he shall not escape. The prophet Ezekiel had already given his memorable prophecy, Eze. 12 : 13, that Zede-kiah should be brought to the laud of the Chal-deans but he should not see it, though he should die there. Yet in spite of these solemn declarations of the prophets of Jehovah, the king gives answer to Jeremiah: "I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands and they mock me." Jer. 38: 19. He feared man more than he feared God. And too late he found that the fear of man bringeth a snare. But why did he fear the Jews? Ah, he was afraid they would make sport of him or, deride him. And what did his weakness and folly cost him? He was taken captive and was obliged to witness the execution of his own sons and nobles; then his own eyes were put out, and be was carried in chains to Babylon, where he died; thus perfectly were the prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah fulfilled, and Jerusalem was left a mass of smoldering ruins just because this king of Israel was afraid some one would make light of him. How many are there in these days that, when the plain word of God convinces them of some duty which brings a heavy cross, let the fear of man control them and begin to inquire, What -will folks say? and refuse to obey the word of the Lord because they fear some of their fellows will mock them! Ah, we know there are too many of this class in the world! Sometimes we find those who will shut their eyes when they see the light beginning to dawn lest they should he convinced of some duty that will bring a cross. The fate of Zedekiah is a monument to the folly of such conduct. What sad results to him and his people, and that glorious city. It was no use for the prophet to plead with him after he had once made a decision not to heed the voice of the Lord. His shameful folly still con-tinued to manifest itself in charging the prophet not to let any one know of their interview. What a heavy heart the poor prophet carried away from that interview none but God and an-gels could know. Reader, let me plead with you before you make the foolish decision of Zedekiab, not to lightly treat the light of truth in regard to that ancient and honorable institution, the Sabbath of Jehovah. Sacred day for rest and worship, given to supply man's spiritual wants, founded Specific Prayer. GOD does more than to give general assur-ance of a willingness to hear prayer, and to relieve human want. Ho makes mention of specific blessings, which he is ready to bestow. These more minute pledges are in various forms of promise, prophecy, covenant, and command. A promise is a direct engagement; a covenant is a still more formal and solemn act, usually accompanied by a seal; a prophecy is a state-ment of divine purpose, intended for our en-couragement in prayer and labor; and a com-mand always implies a result which God is willing to aid us in securing. It is only neces-sary, then, to ascertain that the desired favor is covered by some promise, covenant, prophecy, or command, to have a perfect warrant for faith that, in answer to prayer, God will bestow that . very thing. One could not ask for a better ground of assurance. "How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!" We alin entitled to claim, at God's hand, what-ever 'he has been pleased graciously to promise. And so our prayers may and should have the characteristic of perfect faith, that they will be literally answered according to the blessing asked. Are these specific pledges numerous? Do they cover the ground of our usual necessities? Will they impart an element of certainty to our prayers, in the emergencies which men are of-ten called to face? An affirmative reply to these questions is authorized by the language of Scripture. For we find in the Bible prom-ises to the righteous of protection, deliverance, food, raiment, wisdom, guidance, sustaining grace, reward for industry and beneficence, and the presence and power of the Holy Spirit as a guaranty of peace, holiness, and usefulness. The prayer of faith uses these divine assurances as a sufficient ground of conviction that God will aid in the emergency to which any of these promises apply, according to the exigency of the case. The man feels that he can pray with an accompanying certainty of being beard. It is not now so much an occasion of submission, as of grateful expectation. God here has made known his will, in advance. The true submis-sion to it is, to take him at his word, and joy-fully to claim what he has authorized us to ask. Not to do so, is a distrust of him, as well as a robbery of our own souls. It is as though a poor man should neglect to present a beinefac-tor's check at the bank, fearit,  that it ipfight not mean what it said on its face, or mig t for some cause not be paid. As such lack of con-fidence is grievous to our heavenly Father, so a firm faith is his delight.ŠPrayer and Its An-swers. THE Bible is the best illustration of the liter-ature of power, for it always concerns itself' with life; it touches it at all points, and this is the test of any piece of literature, its universal ap-peal to human nature. When I consider the narrow limitations of the Pilgrim households, I can feel what the Bible must have been to them. It was an open door into a world where emo-tion is expressed, where imagination can range, where love and longing find a language, where imagery is given to every noble and suppressed passion of the soul, where every aspiration finds wings. It was history; it was the romance of real life; it was entertainment unfailing; the wonder-book of childhood; the volume of sweet sentiment to the shy maiden; the sword to the soldier; the inciter of youth to heroism; the ref-uge of the aged. Perhaps nowhere can a better illustration be found of the true relation of liter-ature to life than in this example.ŠCharles Dud-ley Warner. PRAYER is not conquering God's reluctance, it is talking hold of his willingness. He is more willing to give than we are to ask. Gideon's Army.
