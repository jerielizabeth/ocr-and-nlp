August 6,1894. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. rn 615 water was thought to have a "mystic power," exactly as the Monks of the Niceties thought, who used it to dissolve the charm of Satan and cleanse the soul from sin. In the Mithraic mysteries the sacred sign of the cross was made upon the forehead. How well the monks and everybody else took up this ancient usage and perpetuated it in Christianity we well know. "Hindus, Assyri-ans, Egyptians, and Romans employed. this sacred sign." It was understood to stand as the symbol of regeneration. Who cannot see that all. the religions of polytheism con-tributed not merely their votaries, but their practices, to the Nicene Church, and how it came about that the dragon gave his power to the beast; and, while worshiping the beast,' they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the beast? Rev. 13: 2-5. But the dragon represents the power wielded by Satan, and, indeed, Satan himself. And that Satan and his angels were worshiped, I will now show. The deMons of the Gen- tiles, which were worshiped, as we have shown, are identified in the New Testament as angels that sinned, and kept not their first estate. Satan, at their head, "was a liar from the beginning and abode not in the truth," and by his lies down through the ages he has "deceived the whole world.", Rev. 12: 8. Satan and his demons-will terminate their existence in the lake of fire. Matt. 25:41. Luke speaks of one possessed with a devil as being possessed with the "spirit of an unclean demon." Chap. 4: 33, Murdoch's translation. This identifies these unclean spirits which filled the land,Šunclean be- cause sinful, and which were cast out by ChristŠwith the demons of the Gentiles. Everybody will therefore acknowledge that the demon gods of the Gentiles are the de- mons, or devils, of the New Testament. How came these Gentiles to so fully rule and possess the Gentile world?ŠEusebius will tell us:Š When those wicked spirits [as he has shown the demons to be] saw mankind brought off to a deifying of the dead, they insinuated themselves, and helped forward their error, by certain motions of the statues which anciently were consecrated to the honor [memory] of the deceased, as also by ostentation of oracles and cures of diseases, whereby they drove the superstitious headlong, sometimes to take them to he some heavenly powers and God indeed, and sometimes to be the souls of their deified worthies; and so the earth-neighboring demons, which are those princes of the air, those spiritualities of wickedness, and ringleaders to all evil, were on all hands ac-counted for great gods. And the memory of those ancient deceased was thought worthy to be cele-brated With a great service, the features of whose bodies the images dedicated in every city seemed to represent, but the souls of them, and the divine incorporeal powers, the wicked demons counter-feited, by working many miracles. Tertullian exhorted the Gentiles to renounce the whole mystery, "which under the names and images of the dead, through signs, mir- acles, and oracles, obtained an opinion of divinity." Chrysostom said that the demons wrought many miracles for the confirmation of paganism. How came the demons to get possession of the Nicene Church?ŠAh, in the same way, under the names and images of the dead, through signs and miracles,-not this time per-sonating the proud heroes of the battle field, but the martyrs of Christ! Comment is un-necessary. I will quote froth Theodoret's eighth book, concerning the curing of the affections of the Greeks, the title of which is "Concerning Martyrs":, If, then, the poet [Hesiod] calls good men after their decease guardians and preservers or deliverers of mortal men from all evil, and, accordingly, the best of philosophers, in confirmation of the poet saying, would have their sepulchers to be served and honored, I beseech you, sirs, why do you find such fault with what we do? For such as were eminent for piety and religion, and for the sake thereof suf-fered death, we also call preservers and physicians. In nowise do we term them demons. God forbid that we should ever fall into such desperate madness [what difference did it make what they called them], but the hearty friends and servants of God. That the souls of holy men, even when they were out of the body, are in a capacity of taking care of men's affairs, Plato affirmeth in the eleventh book of his laws.* But you do not only disbelieve us, but are utterly unwilling to hearken to the loud voice of the events or effects themselves. [That is, the mir-acles repented.] The martyr temples [dead men's sepulchers,. as it were the Gentile temples] are fre-quently to be seen, famous for their beauty and,  greatness. They that are in health pray for the continuance thereof, and they that have been long sick pray for recovery; the barren pray for children, and they that are to take a long journey desire them [the martyrs] to be their companions, or, rather, their guides in the journey, not going to them as gods, but making application to them as divine men and agents for them with God. Now that they who made faithful prayers have obtained their petitions, clearly appears by the presents and gifts brought by the votaries, as so many grateful acknowledgments of their recovery. Accordingly, some do present the effigies of eyes, others of hands, and these made of gold or of silver. Nay, the martyrs have utterly abolished and wiped out of the minds of men the memory of those who were called gods [demons]. Our Lord God bath brought his dead into the place of your gods, whom he bath sent packing, and bath given their honor to his martyrs. For, instead of the feasts of Jupiter and Bacchus, are now celebrated the festivals of Peter and Paul and Thomas and Ser-gius, and other holy martyrs. Wherefore, since you see there is so much advantage by honoring the martyrs, be persuaded, I beseech you, to flee from the errors of demons, and, making. use of the mar-tyrs as so many lights and guides, follow the way which leads directly to God. Hear the apostle: "But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacri-fice to devils, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils." "The doctrine of demons" was the doctrine of the mediation, intercession, and ministry of dead men, as divine agents with the gods. It matters not whether they be called saints or heroes who were thus invoked. The Gentile doctrine of demons was transferred to the Catholic Church; and demons wrought as fully therein as they had before in paganism. It is the same doctrine now taught in Spiritual- ism, and in very many of the pulpits of our land, howbeit the Bible asserts that the dead have no more a part forever in anything that is done under the sun, that their "rove, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished." "They praise not the Lord," until the final resurrection. Thus the prophecy of Paul in 1 Timothy 4 was fulfilled. They departed from the faith of Jesus, and gave heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hy-pocrisy, forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from meats, etc. It is futile, absurd, outrageous to claim for the Nicene Church any holiness. They were one and all mastered by an illusion, of which demon worship was the all-absorbing thought, the-central figure. It is madness to say that monkery was not then held up by the great divines as the summit of Christain attain- ments, more than madness to claim that the vows of continence and virginity, taken by *Note in this the predominance of heathen opinion: It is notable everywhere that Plato's opinions and teachings. were retained. Augustine and Origen hold Plato as a Bible inter-preter. hundreds of thousandsŠall the monks and clergyŠby men and women strangers to God's grace, salutary, for they brought all confusion into family relations. And "spiritual affin-ities" worked then as now. It is blind infatu-ation and desperation to say that the minds of the people were not as by an epidemic turned to a belief in miracles as wrought by dead heroes, whose bones were "resplendent with miracles and terrific prodigies" (Greg-ory), and that this was not demonolatry pure and simple. And finally no one can affect not to recognize in this a wonderful and com-plete fulfillment of the Spirit's express declara-tion in the monkish portrait given in 1 Tim. 4 : 1-3, that "some should apostatize from the faith." FIRST PRINCIPLES, OR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. Even in Religion, and in Religion above All Things. BY H. F. PHELPS. No ONE thought of vindicating religion for the conscience of the individual, till a voice in Judea, breaking day for the greatest epoch in the life of humanity, by establishing a pure, spiritual, and uni-versal religion for all mankind, enjoined to render to Csar only that which is Caesar's. The rule was upheld during the infancy of the gospel for all men. No sooner was this religion adopted by the chief of the Roman Empire than it was shorn of its character of universality, and enthralled by an unholy connection with the unholy State; and so it continued till the new nation,Šthe least defiled with the barren scoffings of the eighteenth century, the most general believer in Christianity of any people of that age, the chief heir of the Reforma-tion in its purest forms,Šwhen it came to establish a government for the United States, refused to treat faith as a matter to be regulated by a corporate body, or having a headship in a monarch or a State. Vindicating the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting, in its rela-tions to God, the principle first divinely ordained of God in Judea. It left the management of temporal things to the temporal power; but the American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several States, withheld from the Federal Govern-ment the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul ; and not from indifference, but that the Spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom, and purity, and power.ŠHistory of the Formation of the Consti-tution, in Two Republics. The only reason why "the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience," was not withheld from the several States which adopted the Federal Constitution, was because of the jealousies that existed at the time of its adoption, in regard to State rights, and because of the fact that nearly all the States did have laws, either defining or en-forcing religion and religious institutions, which were considered necessary to the wel- fare of the State, and by which they could "invade the home of reason," and because so many, at that time, were so firmly wedded to the idea that a union of religion and the State was necessary. Witness their laws against sabbathŠSundayŠbreaking, blasphemy, and witchcraft, also laws imposing taxation for the support of religious instruction, and com-pulsory attendance at public worshipŠlaws which had existed from almost the first set-tlements, some of which exist even to this day. If the framers and defenders of the national Constitution had insisted that these laws did "invade the realm of conscience," disputing the right of the States to enact or to enforce such laws, it would only have re-sulted in the defeat of their plans for a gen-eral government, and the rejection of the Constitution itself. Thus,while it was the purpose of our fathers
