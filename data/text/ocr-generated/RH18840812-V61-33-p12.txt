Now, while I believe that we should be courteous to all and bear with those that God bears with, I think we should be careful how we join hands and have fellowship with those who have turned their backs on the truth of God. The apostle asks this question : " What fellow-ship hath righteousness with unrighteousness, and what communion hath light with darkness 'I " 2 Cor. 6 : 14. Light and darkness, righteousness and unright- eousness, cannot mix together any better than oil and water. We cannotplace too high a regard on the word of God, nor treat it too sacredly; neither can we realize too. keenly the condition those place themselves in who reject it. The Psalmist says, "God has magnified his word above all his name." Ps. 138 : 2. Again, many of our brethren do not realize of importancesustaining the cause of God   thefrom with their means. They make pledges to the cause, then fail to pay them. Do you realize, my brethren, that God regards this a sin ? Read Dent. 23 : 21-23. The pledges we make are free- will offerings to the cause; and the Lord says, " Thou shalt not slack to pay it," and it would be sin if we should. Read also Num. 30 : 2. The Saviour says, "Render to God the things that are God's." Matt. 22 : 21. Compare this with Lev. 27 : 30-32, and see if we can live out the teachings of Jesus and withhold our tithes. I was with Bro. Goodrich two evenings at Dan- forth. He is having a good interest there. May God impress hearts with the importance of obeying the truth. S. J. Hanson.

Watt gave a course of lectures last win-journey, we have had to leave with. reluctance and sadness, as we saw souls who, bound by the powers of darkness, could have been loosed with proper la- bor. May God clothe us with power from on high. M. AND H. ENOCH. BOLIVAR, POLK CO., ATJG. 4.ŠWe came to this place and commenced meetings July 25 ; have had a good hearing from the first. At present we are in the midst of the Sabbath question, and the in- terest is increasing. Many are deeply moved as seems to be present, and solemnity pervades the meetings. Some are already convinced. May God help them to take a stand for the truth. DAN. T. JONES. R. S. DONNELL. YORK. ALBANY, AUG. 5.ŠOn June 26 Eld. E. W. Whitney and myself arrived at this city to make further arrangements to start the mission work here, after which Bro. Whitney departed to fill his appointment. The next day I started for New York City to meet my sister and her family on their arrival from II olland, and render them necessary assistance for the remainder of their as they are unable to speak the English language. On my return to Albany, I found Bro. Hicks, Rome, ready to join in the work. He has since been laboring among the canal boats as a faithful worker ; while I have given my attention mostly to the large class that leave the great cities - to seek rest and recreation during the summer, passing through Albany on both railroad and steamer. As there is so much travel through the city that our time is taxed to the utmost, very little has yet been done in the way of canvassing for our periodicals. Bro. Crocket has helped us a few days, and it is hoped that in the near future he may be able to devote all his time to this precious work. We find a good many Germans here, also some four  or five hundred Hollanders. We have suc- ceeded in placing before the former some of our German publications, and have obtained a few subscriptions for the Stimme. The latter class we cannot labor with to advantage, as we are un-able to furnish them with any reading matter, not having publications in this language. We have had regular Sabbath meetings, which have been precious seasons to us. We have found some interested ones inquiring after the truth, and with these we have had services in 'which were presented different points of our faith. We feel that the work done in this large city is as a drop in the great ocean ; yet we expect to see at last, as the result of our labors, some precious souls saved in the kingdom of God. Our faith and courage are good. Pray for us, dear brethren and sisters. J. F. STUREMAN. AMONG THE CHURCHES. ŠSince the Chillicothe camp-meeting I have visited the following places:Š June 12-19, was with the friends in DeKalb Co., ter. Found three keeping the Sabbath as the re- suit of his labors. One was desiring baptism, but as he was using tobacco, the matter was deferred. There are thirteen in all keeping the Sabbath there, but some are not in full harmony with Seventh- day Adventists. Still they hold Sabbath-school and prayer-meeting. I did what I could to instruct them. July 1-10, we had some good meetings with the Winston church. Four were baptized, and three united with the church. July 11-15, was with the friends at Utica. Six were baptized, and five united with the church. July 16-20, was with the Boston church. We had excellent meet- ings, and three united with the church. July 21-29, was with Brn. Alice and Bunch at, thetent. Gave seven discourses. We hope some will obey. I am now at Maple, Macon Co., which will be my address for some time, as I commence a course of lectures in a large church here to-night. I am of good courage, and ask the prayers of all who love our blessed Lord. Jury 81. C. H. CHAFFEE, . KANSAS. LAWRENCE, JULY 30.ŠI have been here several weeks trying to follow up the interest created by the camp-meeting and missionary work. About twenty-five have signed the covenant, and we have quite an interesting Sabbath-school. Some are mov- ing away, which will weaken the work here. Last Sabbath eight persons were buried in baptism, R. F. BARTON. DAKOTA, HunoN, AUG. 5.ŠCame to this.  place July 22, in company with Bro. M. M. Ruiter, and com- menced meetings the 24th. The first evening there was apparently a very good interest, though the attendance was not large. But the next afternoon a severe storm, which extended far into the night, broke up our meeting entirely ; and as the weather continued stormy for several days the prospect was rather dark for getting up much of an interest. But we kept at work the best we could, and since the weather has changed for the better, there has been a corresponding improvement in our attend- ance, and the interest is gradually rising. Some of the leading citizens are steady listeners ; the subjects presented are becoming a theme of conversation; the papers are giving us quite favorable notices ; the Lord gives freedom in praying and speaking, and we hope for some good results. The proprie- tor of the best restaurant in town makes us welcome to his tables as long as we stay, urging us to come, and refusing to take anything. Bro. Streman is now with us to look after the work among the Scandinavians. Brethren, pray for -us. S. B. WHITNEY. AMONG THE CHURCHES.ŠFrom Hallowell we stopped at Stover, where there are a few Sabbath- keepers, and spoke a few times. Then we went to Snow Hill, where we remained five days. This is a young church, but we found the members sound on every point of faith. How hungry they were for the word I The attendance from the out- side was so large that there was but little standing room for the speaker, and many who could not get in listened at the windows. Owing to the crowd, but little could be done in the evening for the church, but the meetings in the day time were ex- cellent. Nearly all of the brethren and sisters came forward and sought God with all their hearts. The parting meeting was an excellent one. As we looked at the bright faces and tear- ful eyes, and listened to the cheering testimonies we felt that the Lord was indeed very near. We next visited the Moline church. The Lord gave freedom in presenting the word, which was close and practical. Here we found some who needed to be taught -the first principles of the ora- cies of God. Heb. 5 : 12-14. But, thank God, they learned the lesson, and once more returned to the Lord. The meetings here were also very good, and this dear people were much strength- cued and benefited as the Lord fed them from meeting to meeting. The anxious seat was also offered, and not a, few availed themselves of the offer, where hearty confessions of sin were made. " If my people which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin." 2 Chron. 7 : 14. After a good parting meeting we buried two willing souls by baptism. From Moline we visited a small company of Sab- bath-keepers who live between Longton and How- ard. Several Sabbath-keepers moved to this place a few years ago, and through their, labors others have accepted the truth. They were holding reg- ular Sabbath-school and Sabbath meetings. Re- mained with them three days and held six meet- ings. They are no doubt ready for organization as soon as the preacher in charge can attend to it. Three went forward in baptism, and will be re- ceived into the Moline church. All these places INDIANA. DUPONT, Aura 4.ŠWe have now been here over eight weeks. We had decided to take down the tent this morning, and move to Butlerville in Jen- nings Co. But many interested ones pleaded for us to remain longer. We then said that if it was du- ty for us 'to continue yet for a time, that it would be made known to us in some way. As five more have signed the covenant to-day, we take it as evi-dente that we should continue our meetings another week at least. Twenty-four have signed the covenant, and a-bout forty have given us their names to become members of the Sabbath-school. Our friends here desire to erect a house of worship in the near fu- titre. If we can secure a lot we will encourage the enterprise. Several are interested who are wide- cided, but we labor on in hope of seeing them obey. Some have begun the work of overcoming tobacco. Pray for the work here. WM. COVERT. M. G. HUFFMAN. MAINE. DANFORTH, AUG. 4.ŠThe interest still is good, and new ones are coming out to obey the truth. Prejudice is giving way, and the Spirit of God is at work in the hearts of some. We praise the Lord for the truth; it never looked better. Our courage is good in the message. Pray for us. J. B. GOODRICH. C. W. GUERRIER. BROOKSTON, AUG. 5.ŠHave held twenty-two meetings. The interest apparently is second to none that we have seen. Our general average is above two hundred. The people come mostly from the country, yet this is a very busy season for the farmers. Have held one Sabbath-meeting with nearly one hundred present. Some have already decided to keep all of God's commandments. Books sell quite well, and our collections are good. Invitations to visit people at their homes are nu-merous, and in bringing eatables to the tent we find them equally liberal. Bro. David Overly, who is canvassing for the Signs, has taken twenty-nine trial subscriptions and has also sold quite a num- her of tracts and pamphlets. The outlook is really promising. The Methodists are holding a camp-meeting in an adjacent town, but they are not having very AMONG THE CHURCHES.ŠSince my report of July 7, I have visited the churches at East Wash- burn, Monticello, Linneus, Oakfield, Hartland, and Clinton; and also the brethren at Blaine, East Blaine, Bridgewater, and Burnham. At East Washburn we tried to impress on the minds of the brethren the importance of this message, and the sacredness of the word of God. A sort of "hail-fellow-well-met "spirit has pre- vailed in a great measure in the past, regardless of bow much light and truth a person has heard and re- ,jetted; and there are some of our brethren in Aroostook Co. who are, not free from it, and are too ready to join hands and have fellowship with those who are enemies of our faith, and who think that the Spirit of God is at work with those that
