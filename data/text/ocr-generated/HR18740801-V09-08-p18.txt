2412 THE HEALTH REFORMER. a half hour : do any thing rather than carry about in your mouth a source of disgust to your friends, and mortification to yourself. Even the scouring of a plate with ashes and sand, which I first saw practiced by a country lady of my acquaintance, has its merits in the absence of all other materials, although I prefer other methods. I must caution you against expecting certain results, from any of the above-mentioned meth-ods of cleansing. The causes of fetor are differ-ent according to the physiological condition of the wearer. The same agent that will render one plate odorless, may have no effect on another. That kind of treatment which would commonly prove perfectly effectual, might utterly fail when the health is impaired, and the secretions of the mouth in a morbid state. There have been times when I desired to carry no source of offense about me. If that time comes to you who are wearing a dental plate, as it will come on some particular day, and at some particular hour, I have no doubt that you will commence at the beginning and run through all the methods of purification which I have described, perhaps inventing many new ones, rather than fail to present yourself with a sweet breath. I heartily wish you success, and to that end I offer you a single additional sug-gestion. After your plate has been well cared for, your breath may still be vile beyond description. Now turn your attention to the remainder of your natural teeth, and to the mucous mem-brane of the mouth, throat, and nasal passages, about which I shall remark in a future article. COMMON SENSE.ŠThere is a chilly, disagree-able article, called common sense, which is, of all things most repulsive and antipathetical to all petted creatures whose life has consisted in flattery. It is the kind of talk which sisters are very apt to hear from brothers, and daugh-ters from fathers and mothers, when fathers and mothers do their duty by them ! which sets the world before them as it is, and not as it is painted by flatterers. Those women who prefer the society of gentlemen, and who have the faculty of bewitching their senses, never are in the way of hearing from this cold mat-ter-of-fact region ; for them it really does not ex-ist. Every phrase that meets their ear is polished and softened, guarded and delicately turned, till there is not a particle of homely truth left in it. They pass their time in a world of illu-sions; they demand these illusions of all who ap-proach them, as the condition of peace and fa-vor. All persons, as by a sort of instinct, rec-ognize the woman who lives by flattery and give her the portion of meat to which she is en-titled in due season ; and thus some poor wom-en are hopelessly buried, as suicides used to be  in Scotland, under a mountain of rubbish, to. which each passer-by adds one stone. It is only by some extraordinary power of circumstances that a man can be found to invade the sover-eignty of a pretty woman with any disagreeable tidings, or as Junius says, to " instruct the throne in the language of truth."

Ward & Co. have erected bar-racks as receptacles for the dead and hopelessly diseased horses of Boston. The stench which naturally arises from the great mass of corrup-tion upon the island can better be imagined than described. The air for miles becomes im-pregnated with a sickening odor. And as the gentle south wind wafts this perfume toward the inhabitants of City Point, you may see the people beat a hasty retreat from the sea-shore to find shelter from the awful stench wafted by the breeze, not daring to raise their win-dows for fear of inhaling this most offensive air. The inhabitants of City Point, having endured this continued nuisance until forbear-ance ceased to be a virtue, petitioned for the removal of Ward's Island, or the establishment situated thereon, further down the harbor. This would have cost the Messrs. Ward & Co. several thousand dollars. They were put to their wit's end to find a remedy to save this evil about to befall them. They planned and speculated upon various methods by which to stay the hands of justice and so save expense. Finally they adopted the plan of enlarging the number of scavengers, so that the putrified flesh of horses, and other decayed matter, might be at once entirely consumed. Thus, a still larger herd was transported to the island, which served to answer a two-fold purpose, quelling the clamorings of an enraged people by devouring the filth and thus purifying the air, and at the same time making the invest-ment one of immense profit to the proprietors by fattening the hogs for the Boston and European markets. It is indeed astonishing that the very people who complained most of the loathsome smell arising from the great mass of corruption should be the very ones to feast upon the same foul flesh by eating the hogs after they had eaten it.
