236 THE HEALTH REFORMER. Alcohol in the Kitchen. [WE commend the following article to the serious consideration of our readers. Although we hope that most of our patrons are genuine reformers, it is possible that some of them may not be wholly innocent of some of the charges preferred.ŠEn.] I do not now refer particularly to the con-tents of the black bottle which Susan or Biddy may possibly have smuggled, " unbeknownst to the misthress," into the department of culinary science in the modern household. It is to the evil spirit of alcohol, wherever or however its satanic power may be made manifest in the processes of the culinary art, delicate and pro-found as may be those mysteries, that I would make most pointed allusion. I am not sure but every crusade against strong drink in the house should begin in the.  kitchen and end in the drawing room. At any rate, when you consider the subject culinarily, you reach, by consent, a vital point in your treat-ment of the whole question. What men eat has a great deal to do with what they drink. More than this, their eating may be such as to directly create and cultivate the habit of drink-ing intoxicating liquors. It is plain that if the fumes and taste of alcohol are regularly, or even frequently, recognized in the food of the people, that the desire to take it " straight," as the topers have it, will be perfectly natural and unavoidable. Plain, simple, nutritious cookery will never create or foster an appetite for strong drink. Mixing puddings and pastry, and the variety of dishes which might be recounted, with alcoholic fluids certainly will. Look at the vast array of fruit-cakes, pies, puddings, jellies, sauces, preserves, in their well-nigh interminable variety, and witness the in-sidious workings of the alchoholic fiend under the guise of necessary nutriment ! Why can-not the luscious fruits of the summer and the autumn time be preserved with their natural flavor and pleasantness, and the " devil's juice " of brandy left out of the process 4 Why must the most harmless and healthful of articles be contaminated with the poison of alcohol before they are placed upon our tables ? Why must sweet cream, and snowy sugar, and choice fruits, and the variety of things, good and healthful in themselves, used in puddings and pastries and desserts, in jellies and confections, be " doc-tored " with alcohol? These are serious ques-tions for the thoughtful Christian women of to-day. If they are to be the leaders and saviors of the land in the war against intemperance, let them be careful that no blood of the inebriate be found at the doorways of their kitchens. Let them purge the culinary art of all that is bad and vicious, notably of every alcoholic prep-aration whatever. It must be clear to observ- ant people that if from every kitchen of the land, in hotel, boarding-house, and the houses of pri-vate living, there issued only healthful foods and drinks, and these everywhere in abundance, and served with scrupulous neatness and the appliances of real comfort, there would be a heavy blow stricken at depraved physical appe-tites and tastes. " High " living and poor liv-ing have combined to curse the nation in mul-titudinous cases, and drive their victims to the maddening bowl to satisfy cravings of appetite which should have been answered by full sup-plies of sweet, pure, and healthful food and drink. An, as yet, unwritten tale of history will rise up in judgment against the careless, unwise, or unthrifty housewives who have permitted these things, and its record will be mighty with evil. In the excitement of other and bolder phases of the drink question, alcohol in this quieter, but none the less deadly, sphere of its operations has largely been forgotten. In a collection of recipes before me, published under the auspices of a religious society of ladies, I find, in the list of puddings and sauces, such directions as these : " Wine to the taste," " eat with wine-sauce," " add a cup of wine " ; of " Eve's pudding " it is said that " Adam would n't eat it without wine " ; " pour two table-spoonfuls of brandy over it," " two table-spoonfuls of brandy," and all on a single page. In a cake-list which I have inspected, also pre-pared by the hands of religious women, we have items like " brandy," " half tea-cup of brandy," " half a glass of brandy," etc. ; of " miscellan-eous" items we have "hot wine-sauce," "brandy," " one pint of wine," etc. These samples are quite sufficient to show the range which the use of liquor takes in the cookery of many house-holds ; and this would be extremely mild, doubt-less, in comparison with numerous cases in the ultra-fashionable ranks of society. A war, then, in the kitchen, upon every brandy-flask, and demijohn, and decanter, and wine-bottle, upon every sight and smell of the hateful poison ! A grand campaign, with mop, and broomstick, and shovel, and poker, against old King Alcohol ! Clear away the cider-cask from the cellar below, and baste the sides of the portly rum-jug till all the spirit is out of it Hard at them all, mistress and maid, in a.  hand-to-hand fight, a home " crusade," until your queenly dominions are forever rid of the lusty giant ! And sign a treaty, a solemn compact, a kitchen pledge, to be true to the real friend of the housewife, the patron of her help-ers, and the crowning blessing of the well-ordered houseŠsweet, cleansing, healthful, and life-giving water.ŠJAMBS H.
