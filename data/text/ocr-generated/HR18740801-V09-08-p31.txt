THE HEALTH REFORMER. 255. Z o gorroopondtuto. SUGAR AND MILK.ŠH. C., Ind., asks, 1. What is a person to do who has a terrible crav-ing for sweet at times ? 2. Is not the use of nearly a quart of hot milk at one meal almost as unhealthy as drinking two cups of tea or coffee made weak I Ans. 1. A terrible craving for any article of food, unless prompted by excessive hunger, is wholly unnatural and abnormal, and the best way to become free from it is to resist and overcome it. Still, in the present case, the ap-petite may perhaps be appeased by the use of sweet fruits, as dates, raisins, or figs. We do not wish to be understood as wholly condemn-ing the use of sugar under all circumstances, although some people will do well to avoid it almost entirely, and all should avoid excess. 2. We should have no hesitation in saying that such a practice is certainly almost as bad, if not much worse. Drinking anything at meals is a very reprehensible practice. Drink-ing milk is very unhealthful, chiefly because mastication is necessary to secure proper diges-tion. If milk must be used, it should be chewed, like other food. This can only be done by eating it with solid food. PARIS GREEN AND POTATOES.ŠL. M. in-quires, Is it injurious to use potatoes that have had Paris green on them to destroy the bugs Ans. We suppose our correspondent refers to the practice of sprinkling Paris green upon the tops of potato vines. When the practice was first begun, there was considerable said about its being dangerous ; but we have heard of no cases of poisoning resulting from it, ex-cept of potato bugs. Dr. Kedzie, professor of chemistry in the Agricultural College of this State, maintains that there is not the least dan-ger from eating potatoes which have been pre-served from destruction by the use of Paris green, unless a very great excess of the poison should be employedŠmuch more than is ordi-narily used. DEFECTIVE FILTER.ŠE. G., Cal., writes, " I have one of Kedzie's filters which lets the char-coal through every time water is drawn. I have had it some months, and still it do n't im-prove. Can you prescribe a remedy I" Ans. It is quite probable that the earthen jar in your filter is broken. You should re-move the contents and examine it. CHILDREN'S CLOTHINGŠCARE OF THE HAIR. ŠS. P. C.: 1. We do not issue patterns for children's clothing. 2. In many respects light flannel under-clothing is superior to cotton at all seasons of the year. 3. Neither very cold nor very hot water should be employed in dressing the hair ; the first is unpleasant, and the second is injurious. WORMS.ŠMany requests are sent us, asking for a remedy for worms. " Worm Tea " is often. recommended as an anthelmintic in answer toŁ such requests. This article can be obtained at. the Health Institute. The Bistoury, an enter-prising medical journal, recommends anoint-ing the anus with sweet oil as a very efficient-. remedy when perseveringly applied, as it pre--vents the deposit of eggs. A rigid dietary is. also necessary. BEST SUGAR.ŠJ. H., Ohio, wishes to know which we consider the better sugar ; the white,, or the light brown variety. Ans. The whitest, purest, cleanest sugar is: undoubtedlythe bast commercial kind to be obŠtained. Much of the light brown and cheaper-grade of coffee sugar is greatly adulterated by the use of nitric and sulphuric acids which are employed in manufacturing them from poor-material. But the best sugar is sugar still, and must be regarded as a suspicious article of food ; for we are so likely to eat too freely of it. PARALYSIS.ŠE. J. P., Mich., had shock of-palsy over twenty years ago ; is now troubled with numbness, and sometimes pain in hands. and arms. She wishes to know if she is again threatened with the same disease. Ans. The numbness referred to is usually regarded as a premonitory symptom of paralysis.. You should immediately take active measures to avert the disease. Send at once for a home prescription. WEAK EYES.ŠC. G. B., MEM., has weak eyes which blur and sometimes maturate. He-wishes to know what to do for them. Ans. Weak eyes are commonly the result of some constitutional disease. More frequently-than otherwise, they are caused by derange-ments of the liver. The only remedy is strict obedience to the laws of health and hygiene. ' We cannot prescribe more definitely without having a more minute description of your case and general conditions. ITCH.ŠA correspondent, who seems to be a very enthusiastic and confident adherent of the hydropathic system of treatment, writes us that he has successfully treated a number of ' cases of this very unpleasant disease by the use of water alone. He feels certain that he can cure the worst case of itch in one week by means of the pack and dripping-sheet. We are very glad this gentleman is so successful in treating this disease with simple remedies, and wish that we could report that others of very extensive experience and practice have found the water treatment always effectual in exterm-inating the little mite which gives rise to the disease. The object to be gained is the death of the parasite. If he can be drowned or suffo-cated, very good ; but if it is necessary to poison him, as is sometimes the case, do not spare him..
