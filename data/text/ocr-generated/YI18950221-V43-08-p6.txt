62 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. FEBRUARY 21, 1896. MY BABY BROTHER. I 's dot a baby brover ; He's two years old some day ; And he 's such a sight o' bover, For he never lets me play. If I tries to rock my dollies, And make 'em go to seep, He jerks 'em out de tradle, And tomps 'em wid his feet. When I dot my china dishes On Tansdivin' day, And spread 'em on de table, What you 'spose my brover say ? Well, he did n't say just nuffin ; He just toddled tross de floor, And den grab my table-clof, And went marchin' out de door. Once I had a tandy apple, But I has n't got it now ; For it 's all been smashed and eated, By dat naughty baby boy. Well, I does dit opt of patience, And I dess I 'll div him 'way, So if you wants a baby brover, Just tome up, some wainy day. Š Selected.

A RELATION OF ACTUAL FACTS. AT one of the mission schools in Teheran, Persia, a little group of boys were gathered to-gether one hot August morning, in earnest consultation. There were six boys in the group, the oldest not over eighteen years and the youngest scarcely fifteen ; but their grave demeanor, serious faces, and subdued tones testified to the importance and gravity of the subject under consideration. It was a time of terror in the Persian cap- ital. Cholera had broken out in the crowded city, and from its every quarter the terrified people were fleeing for their lives, leaving those already stricken with the dreadful dis-ease to die alone, and those who could not seek safety in flight to get through the epi-demic as best they could,Š to live or die as it might happen. Jew, Moslem, and Parsee, bitterest enemies under other conditions, fled together now, all intent upon the one absorbing purpose Š to escape from danger. Only in the missionary quarters did reason and order prevail, and there the devoted, self-sacrificing followers of the Great Physician made preparation to stand their ground, and fight the destroyer. Hurried consultations were held, and or-ganizations effected to relieve the suffering in the cholera-stricken city. A hospital was quickly fitted up and thrown open for the re-ception of cholera patients ; but the mission-aries were only a handful, comparatively, and already had more to do than they were equal to doing. Nurses must be had at once, and a call, urgent and pressing, went out for volun-teers. It was this call for help that had brought to-gether the little group of boys at the mission school, where the case had been stated at the morning prayers ; and it was this they were discussing so earnestly. They were native Armeniani, all of them ; sons of Parsee parents, who, as you know, are fire-worshipers, and followers of Zoroaster. But these boys had learned of Christ in the mission school, and were now trying to follow his teachings. " Brothers," said the oldest one, and the leader among them, " you have heard that help is greatly needed in the hospital to nurse the sick. What shall we do ? " There was a brief silence, then one of the little company said gently : " I think it is what the Lord would have done, and what he would like us to do. I will go, for one." " And I, for another," said a second. Another brief silence, then a third said : " I too will go, if these go." " And I," said the fourth. " And I too," echoed the fifth. " We are of one mind," said the leader. " We will all go, trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ for streng.th and help. Let us pray to- gether, and then we will go to our superintend-ent, and tell him our desire." The six boys dropped upon their knees, and six short, earnest prayers went up for help and guidance and protection in the work about to be undertaken ; then together the little com-pany left the room, and sought the superin-tendent of the, school to make known their determination, and obtain his permission to report- at once to the hospital for duty. " We want to go to the new hospital to help take care of the sick there," announced the leader, when they had found the one they sought. The missionary looked surprised, and hesi- tated to give the necessary permission. " I am glad to find my boys ready for service," he said finally ; " but have you considered the matter well ? It is dangerous work. You may lose your lives by going." " We have thought of that," was the reply, " but we do not fear ; we trust in God." " And he will surely keep you," responded the missionary. " Hear what he says in his word." And taking out his little pocket Bible, he opened it to the ninety-first Psalm, and read aloud those reassuring, inspiring promises to God's people in time of trouble or danger ; then, with a prayer for their safety, he sent them on their mission of mercy. When they presented themselves at the hospital, the medical missionary in charge looked at them very doubtfully, as they stated their business, and asked to be assigned to duty at once. " You are all so young," he objected. " But we are strong and willing," was the response. " But without knowledge or experience," he continued. " Yes ; but we will do just as we are told, and we will soon learn." " But you are natives, and all natives are afraid of the cholera. When it comes to the point of handling cholera patients, you will be overcome with fear, and desert us." " No," was the answer, " we are not afraid. We believe God, and he has promised to take care of us." " True ; but what if you are asked to nurse Jews or Moslems They are your enemies, you know," suggested the physician, deter-mined to test the applicants thoroughly before accepting them. " That will make no difference to us. Our Master forgave his enemies, and we can for-give ours ; does he not say, Love your ene-mies ' ? " " You may stay," said the physician ; and they were at once put to work. Then followed six long weeks of toil and  danger and hardship ; day after day the pesti-lence raged fiercely throughout the city, keep-ing the little hospital filled to overflowing all the time. Many of the patients died, and some Š a few Š recovered ; but as fast as the beds were emptied, others were brought in to fill them up. The nurses and physicians were busy day and night ; oftentimes they could not snatch time either to eat or sleep, but must keep going until their eyes were heavy from lack of sleep, and their steps lagged from sheer weariness and weakness. But through it all our six young friends never faltered. That ninety-first Psalm be-came their watchword, and they went serenely about their self-appointed tasks with a prayer in theft hearts and that blessed Psalm upon their lips. " He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty " would be the words of greeting from one to another as they met and passed each other in their work. " I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fort-ress : my God ; in him will I trust," would be the response. " Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence." When courage wavered or faith grew dim, what cheer and comfort there was in the prom-ise that read, " There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwell-ing ! " And that other : " Thou shalt not be afraid for' the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for the destruc-tion that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee." And these promises were fulfilled to them. For six weeks they went in and out among the dead and the dying,Š faithful, tireless, and efficient, untouched and unharmed, though twenty thousand victims had fallen in the city, fifty of whom died under their very eyes, while many a Jew and many a Moslem lived to bless the tender care of these young Armenian nurses to whom he owed his life. At the end of that six weeks the epidemic abated, having spent its force. Gradually the hospital beds were emptied, and not filled up again. The refugees came crowding back to the city, anxiously inquiring about friends and relatives whom they in their terror had heart-lessly deserted and left to their fate. Business was resumed, and once more the city assumed its usual air. Then, and not until then, did the six young Armenian boys lay aside their nurse's garb, and return to the quiet, peaceful routine of student life in the mission school, all uncon-scious that the angels had recorded them as heroes, and well content to have done what they believed their Master would have them do.ŠJennie White, in Sunday-School Visitor. "I WOULD SWIM THE SEAS FIRST." WHEN a young Japanese lady became a convert to the Christian faith, in her English school, she desired to return immediately to her home in the Flowery Land, to tell her mates and friends of Jesus. , Some tried to persuade her to remain for the comforts and advantages of an English home, and warned her of the great sacrifices that would' follow her return. She was not moved by the ap- peals, except to a more intense desire for home, exclaiming, " I would swim the seas but what I would go to my friends with this sweet story of Jesus and his love."Š Glad Tidings.
