quired. I did not feel satisfied, but there the mat-ter stopped until one morning at family prayers as I was reading the twenty-fourth chapter of Mat-thew, my mind suddenly rested on the 20th verse, "Pray ye that your flight be not in the Winter, neither on the SABBATH DAY," and I was con-vinced that the seventh day was the day that God required us to keep holy. I then asked strength from him to keep the true Sabbath of the Lord. Dear young friendsŠI can now say that I find it good to keep the fourth commandment. Will you all obey God's law and live ? M. A.

Seymour's " Fifty Unanswerable Arguments" against the Sabbath, and all those (so-called) argu-ments taken together do not furnish as good an one as I heard from a little girl seven years old, who was censured for playing on Sunday. When re-proved she very modestly replied, " The Bible says the seventh day is the Sabbath!" Is not this an unanswerable argument ? Where does the Bible say that the first day of the week is the Sabbath ? Nowhere ! Where does it say that the command, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," is done away? Nowhere! Then may we not ask with Peter, Acts iv, 19, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto man more than to God, judge ye." Children, keep the commandments. J. F. BALLENGER.

How I came to Keep the Sabbath. Y DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS OF THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR: I have often thought as I read the Instructor that I would let you know how we love this lit-tle paper, and how we first came into the Sabbath truth. My husband and self were both members of the Baptist church, and our two little daughters attended the Sunday School. The youngest being too little to learn the lessons with her sister, I used to teach her a verse to recite in the class. On one occasion I had selected the fourth com-mandment for her to commit and repeat. Early in the morning she came to my bed-side, and awaken-ing me said, " Come, mother, it is the seventh day, the Sabbath. Get up, it is God's holy day." I told her it was the first day of the week. She want-ed to know if it was not the Sabbath. I answered yes. She replied that the commandment she had learned said the "seventh" day was the Sabbath, and she wanted to know if it did n't mean what it said. I told her it did, but since the Saviour had risen on the first day of the week, Christians had kept that day for the Sabbath instead of the sev-enth. She then wanted to know if God told them to do this, or if Jesus told them to. I felt the question to be an important one, as I always considered that I would be responsible to God for what I taught my children. I told her that I had no time to answer that question then, but when she came home from church I would find it in the Bible and read it to her. After they had gone to school I took my Bible to search for the answer, but I looked in vain ; and my little Meta, when she came home asked me if I would read to her out of the Bible when the day was changed. I told her she would have to wait a little while. I might here state that I felt embar-rassed to tell her I did not know where to find it, as I thought it could be found. But the more I searched the more clouded my mind became, and I told my husband that I did n't believe it could be found in the Bible any more than sprinkling could. He thought he could find it, and take the burden off from my mind; but his search proved as fruit-less as mine. I could not now attend to my work, nor sleep at itnight, on account of that question, and I resolved to immediately see the minister, which I did. He told me that his mind had been very much wrought up-on by the same thing, but he came to the conclusion that it was the seventh part of time that was re-
