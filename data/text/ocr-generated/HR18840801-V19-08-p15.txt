GOOD 121MArirrPl. 239 of the rarest genius; yet who would be in favor of a curriculum that included only music, painting, etc., while mathematics in every form were banished? Even a Herschel cannot live upon moonlight alone, and a breakfast must come at last to a Tanner. If you must go among thieves, and must carry money, it were wiser not to put it all in one pocket. Whatever the assurance that the vessel is seaworthy, or that it will make a safe and rapid transit, do n't trust all to one cargo, or to any captain. Many complain of lack of opportunity; but there can be no situation in life that precludes all possibility of growth. The desk, the farm, the workshop, the kitchen, must necessarily absorb much of both time and mind ; but "the life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment," and the moral and mental should receive cul-tivation at the same time with the physi-cal and practical. Hugh Miller performed his work in the limestone quarry as faithfully as any other man ; at the same time those marvelous mental processes were taking place that were to enrich the world. How few men of leisure can claim to have achieved that which Elihu Burritt did while occupied at his blacksmith's forge? Bedford jail was not the most favorable place for Bun-yan to preach the gospel ; but the mind, untrammeled by circumstances, rose roy-ally above its prison walls, and a literary work that has been translated into more languages than any other book, excepting the Bible, was the result. " The sweet singer of Israel," whose lofty strains have filled more hearts with joy and peace than any other poet whom the world has ever known, found his inspiration in the soli-tude of the fields, the blue heavens bend-ing over, while attending to his duties as a humble shepherd boy. Perfection in any direction is not a mo-mentary, mushroom growth, but rather the result of patient, constant endeavor. "Every wise observer knows, Every watchful gazer sees, Nothing grand or beautiful grows, Save by gradual, slow degrees." When we are called to account for the one, five, or ten talents intrusted to our keeping, how many of us will be able to say with Richter, " I have made all of myself that could be made out of the stuff"? Never, while life lasts, will there come a day when we may unclasp the sandals, and lay aside the pilgrim's staff  and mantle. There will ever appear at intervals thorny thickets to be threaded, and loftier peaks to be scaled. The peen of victory can only be sounded from the summit, and the crown must come after Calvary. "A sacred burden is the life ye bear; Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly; Stand up, and walk beneath it steadfastly; Faint not for sorrow, falter not for sin, But onward, upward, till the goal ye win."' CARD-PLAYING AT HOME. PLAYING cards for " pastime " or as an " innocent amusement " soon becomes a passion ; and when once fixed, a man will forego home, family, business, and pleas-ure, and suffer the loss of his all for the exciting scenes of the card-table. That accomplished writer, the late Dr. Hol-land, said :Š " I have all my days had a card-play-ing community open to my observation, and I am yet unable to believe that that which is the universal resort of the starved in soul and intellect, which has never in any way linked to itself tender, elevating, or beautiful associations, the tendency of which is unduly to absorb the attention from more weighty matters, can recom-mend itself to the favor of Christ's disci-. ples. The presence of culture and genius. may embellish, but can never dignify it.. " I have this moment," says Dr. Hol-land, "ringing ill my ear the dying injunc-tion of my father's early friend, Keep your son from cards. Over them I have murdered time, and lost heaven.' Fathers and mothers, keep your sons from -cards in the home circle.' What must a good, angel think of a mother at the prayer-meeting, asking prayers for the conver-sion of her son whom she allowed -to re-main at home playing cards for pas-time'? " The late Bishop Bascom, in denouncing all forms of iniquity, speaks of the " gam-bler, who, rather than not gratify his. passion for play, would stake the throne of eternity upon the cast of a die,Šwho, unmoved by the tears and entreaties of her that bore him, the wife of his bosom, and the children of his own bowels, contin-ues to indulge his hated passion, until, the infatuated reprobate would table his game upon the tomb of his father, or shuffle for infamy upon the threshold of hell."-2'he Safeguard.
