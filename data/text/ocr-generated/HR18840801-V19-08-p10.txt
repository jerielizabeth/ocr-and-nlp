234 GOOD SOUR HEARING POWERS. BY E. H. RICHES, L. L. D., F. R. A. S. fio understand the way in which our 'organs of hearing perceive the effect of a sound, and the manner in which such ,sound is caused, it is necessary to deal with some of the principles of the science known as acoustics. The word itself comes from a Greek verb which means to hear. When vibrations in the air are caused by any impulse or shock, or when any solid substance, being in direct or indirect con-tact with the drum of the ear, is suddenly struck, a sound is heard; but it must be noted that the vibrations produced in the air are the cause of what we understand as sound. This drum, or tympanum, is a wonderful structure of thin membrane closing the aperture of the ear, and in or-der to understand how it is that the sen-sation of sound is produced by this drum ef the ear being struck by the vibration of air, it will be well to bear in mind that there are various tubes and cavities behind the drum of the ear, situated in the bone forming the side of the head, in which it has been ascertained that small fibres of the auditory nerve are distributed. Now this drum of the ear will vibrate freely by reason of the sonorous undulations of the external air acting upon it; and the vibra-tions thus produced are communicated by the action of minute bones, muscles, and fluids contained in the cavities of the ear, to the nerve, and from thence the impres-sions are conveyed to the brain. It must not be supposed, however, that air is nec-essary to the production of sound, al-though most sounds owe their origin to vibrations of the air, for even under water sound can be produced ; and it is further known that all bodies are, to a certain ex-tent, capable of producing those sound vi-brations already spoken of, and also that there are many cases where air is neither the best nor the quickest conductor of sound. There is a simple but interesting experiment as to sound, which may be made with a receiver exhausted of air, in which a bell may be rung without its pro-ducing any sound whatever; and the rea-son why no sound is produced is at once explained by the fact that, as there is no air, there can, therefore, be no vibrations to be received or transmitted. And it may be further noted that what is under-stood by loudness of sound when conveyed by air, depends upon the density of the air; for example, a whisper uttered in a diving-bell is always heard with greater  distinctness than under ordinary condi-tions, for the reason that the air in the diving-bell is greatly condensed by the pressure of water, and consequently re-ceives and transmits vibrations with great readiness. So also at any great altitude, where the air is not so dense as it is lower down, the loudness of sound is always in proportion diminished. With reference to the statement made above, that sound may be produced even under water, it is an easy matter to show that there are so-norous vibrations in liquids; for if a glass half-filled with water be placed on a table, and one finger, being wetted, be steadily rubbed round the edge of the glass. a sound will be at once produced, and the surface of the water will be covered with minute undulations. The loudness of sound produced in liquids depends upon the increase or decrease of their specific gravity. We know by experience that sonorous bodies (that is, bodies which pro-duce sound), which possess the property of sonorousness in the highest degree, are those metals and their alloys which have the greater amount of elasticity and hard-ness. For instance, in the case of the tri-angle, which is a steel rod bent into a tri-angular form, we have an example of the sonorousness of iron ; in the case of cym-bals, that of brass ; and in the case of Chi-nese gongs and bells, which are made of an alloy of three parts copper and one of tin, we have an example of the sonorous-ness of bell-metal. We hear of savages putting their ears to the surface of the ground to listen for the approach of the enemy, and they do this for the reason that they can hear with greater distinct-ness; but although smooth surfaces, such as ice, water, or hard ground, are the best adapted for the transmission of sound, it must be remembered that in the case of solids, when they possess elasticity, sounds are conveyed to the ear far more readily by them than by gases or liquids. The vibrations in the air produced by a sound, move in a series of concentric circles, and the average rate at which sound travels is 1,120 feet in every second; and so it is that the flash of a gun fired at a distance from an observer is seen before the sound of the report is heard, for the reason that light travels much faster than sound, the former traveling at the rate of 192,000 miles in every second. It will be thus seen that this knowledge of the velocity of sound may be made applicable to the measure-ment of distances. For instance, suppose the report of thunder reached us two sec-
