242 GOOD ITRAMTH.      octealsc, HEAL     GOO k v                     BATTLE CREEK, MICH., AUGUST, 1884, J. H. KELLOGG, M. D., EDITOR. TERMS, $1.00 A YEAR. A HYGIENIST ABROAD. SOME of you may have heard of the Ghetto. If , any have ever visited it, you certainly recollect it most distinctly as the dirtiest place you ever beheld or smelled, unless, perhaps, we should except an Al-pine Swiss cottage, where cows, goats, chickens, pigs, and human beings all live under the same roof. The Ghetto is that part of Rome inhabited by the Jews, formerly known as the "Jews' Quarter." It is close by the old theater of Marcus Aurelius, and is densely peopled with the most degraded representa-tions of the Jewish race we have ever met. The filth of the narrow alleys, denominated streets, is beyond description. The filthy gutters are lined with half-naked children,Šsome of whom are nine-tenths na-ked, or more,Šwho wallow in the mud, and inde-scribable nastiness which flows in streams from the swarming tenements on either side. The front rooms of the lower stories of all the houses, are occupied as shops, where are found, dry goods, notions, and sec-ond-hand clothing, which seems to be the trade spe_ cialties of the Jew, the world over. Into this filthy little corner are crowded all the disciples of Judaism who inhabit the holy city. Until recently, it was surrounded by a wall, the gates being locked daily at eight P. M. But the odor is becoming terrific. High above all the lesser 'smells of decaying vegeta-bles, moldy walls, filthy pens, obscure gutters, and the great unwashed multitude, towers a stupendous and overpowering odor of garlic. How we long for a patent charcoal respirator to disinfect the pestilen-tial air I How we marvel that, in this famous city of the gods, fastidious Hygeia has not long ago sent her serpent down among these shameless transgres-sors, to either annihilate them, or coerce them into a better observance of her laws I One can hardly believe that, in a civilized country, the customs and ways of doing things could differ so widely as do those in Italy from what we are familiar with in America. For instance, here is a flour store. A boy turns a crank attached to a big wheel, which, being visible through the open door, attracts our attention, and we venture in. We find that the flour is only ground, and not bolted at the mill; and this little dark-eyed boy is the motive power of a  bolting machine. The entire flour is brought to the store, and by means of a bolting apparatus similar to that used in other countries, but on a very small scale, is separated into first, second, and third grades of flour and bran. The first grade of finest and whitest flour makes bread for the rich; the second grade makes a somewhat coarser and darker bread, and is also used for macaroni; the third grade,Šreally the best of all,Šmakes bread and macaroni for the poor, who consequently are better fed than the rich. The bread made from this flour is rather darker than our Graham bread, being more nearly the color of rye bread, and, when well made, is pal-atable and wholesome. With corn bread, it consti-tutes the chief food of the poor in large cities. In the country, beans and other vegetables are the chief diet, with very rarely a taste of meat. In the north of Italy, the chief food is bread made from chestnut flour, a sample of which we were fortunate in obtaining thrmigh our friend, Prof. Biglia, and have brought home, together with other specialties from the various countries which we visited. Another curious custom is the very common one of carrying on all kinds of household preparations out of doors. How odd it would seem to an American woman to see half a score of her Italian sisters standing up to their knees in a lake or river, industriously scrubbing their linen on the smooth face of a huge stone. Just across from our hotel in Naples, we may see a woman cooking the family dinner over a small charcoal stove, placed just in front of her door, upon the side-walk. She has no hesitation in letting people see the family bill of fare, for all the poor in Naples eat the same thing for dinner,Šbread and macaroni soup,Šprovided they are.  fortunate enough to be able to obtain the macaroni to accompany the bread. One day, when we were riding about in quest of sights, we passed through a street where nearly everybody had their work out of doors. A laundress was doing up her linen on the front door-step; a seamstress had her sewing-machine exactly in the middle of the walk; a shoemaker had turned his whole shop out of doors into the street; and half a dozen cobblers were peg-ging away as industriously as their American breth-ren of the same craft.
