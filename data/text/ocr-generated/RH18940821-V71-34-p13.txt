AUGUST 21, 1894] 13 ADVENT.  REVIEW A.17,6 SABBATH.  HERALD. 541 room, folding-room, bindery, stock-room, gilding-room, marbling-room, and electrotype foundry. The basement contains three large fire-proof vaults for the storage of electro plates and cuts. There are also two large storage rooms for paper in the basement, a room for pipe-fitting, etc. Adjoining the basement is the boiler-room, containing five large boilers which generate the steam for power, .and for heating both buildings as well as the Tabernacle. Crude oil is used for fuel, which is stored in underground iron tanks in rear of the building. On the first floor are the superintendent's office, the lobby, or waiting-room, supplied with our papers and some of the leading periodicals ; the post-office, where the employees receive their mail ; and a library for use of the employees, containing several hundred volumes. In the rear is the stock department. At the northeast corner of this floor is the engraving department. In the rear of this is the case-room, where the covers for the cloth-bound books are made. Beyond this room is the gold-room, where the gold leaf is laid on the book covers, and the embossing-room, where the book covers are stamped. This room contains five embossing machines, and a large cutting machine. West of this is the stock-room, and south of this is the dynamo-room, containing a ninety horse-power high speed engine and a 450-light dynamo, with switchboard and electric indicators of vari-ous kinds, so arranged that current can be taken from the city wires when the number of lights desired does not warrant running our own engine. Electricity is used almost exclusively in all de-partments for lighting. The buildings are also piped for gas, which can be used in case of fail-ure of the electric current. Next south comes the main press-room, con-taining three small or " pony " presses, and seven large cylinder presses, one folding-machine and the large engine, which furnishes power for the whole establishment. The press-room is a large, lofty, well-lighted room, and with its clanging machinery and seemingly endless out-pouring of printed sheets, is a busy place. To the rear of this room and forming the southern part of the building, is the folding-room and mailing department. Here the printed sheets, as they come from the press, are cut and folded, and, if tracts or pamphlets, are here stitched with wire on the stitching-machines. Above this room, on the second floor, is another room used for folding. Going north on the second floor we come to the book composing-room, with its many type-cases and rows of busy compositors. Here the type is set for the various books, tracts, and pam-phlets, besides music type and several monthly and quarterly periodicals. From the book-room we pass to the job department, occupying two rooms, one for composition, and the other for the,five job presses. Next on this floor is the REVIEW and Instructor room, where the type-setting for these papers is done. In this room the type is also set for the German and Holland papers., Ad-joining is the foreign department, where the type-setting for the Swedish and Danish papers, books, tracts, etc., is carried on. On this floor, in various quiet nooks, are five editorial rooms, proof-rooms, etc., where the workers prepare the words that are scattered broadcast over the land. The matter to be printed is handed to the fore-man of the composing-room, who deals it out in takes " to the compositors to be put into tpye. The type is set, a " stick " full at a time, and placed in "galleys," or long receptacles which hold a column or more ; a proof, or impression, of this is taken to the proof-room, read over, the Corrections marked, and handed back to the com- positor, who corrects all the errors he has made. The type is then arranged into pages, another proof of the whole page is taken, and carefully read and corrected. The pages are then locked up into forms of eight pages each for the RE-VIEW, and sent to the press-room, where the  paper is printed, and that which was once in manuscript goes forth to the world. Resuming our journey, we ascend to the third floor and enter the bindery. To give a detailed description of this department would take too much space, and certainly wreck this article in the maelstrom of the waste-basket. The bindery is fully equipped with stitching-machines, presses, paging-machines, and various labor-saving de-vices. It also has two large ruling-machines, which are kept very busy. Connected with the bindery is a gilding-room, where the edges of the books are gilded. On the same floor is an electrotype foundry. This room is very complete in all its details, and turns out a large amount of work. In the rear of the foundry is the machine-shop, where the necessary repairing and keeping up of so large an establish-ment employs the constant attention of an expert machinist. There is a fourth story over part of the build-ing. A complete telephone system connects the various departments with the superintendent's office, which enables communication to be made between the different rooms and offices. A pri-vate line also connects with the Sanitarium. A telegraph office is also located in the building, affording communication by both the Western Union and Postal Telegraph companies, with all parts of the world. A large two-story carpenter shop in the rear is fully equipped with modern machinery for the needs of the establishment for box-making, etc. The west building has recently been enlarged to provide room for offices for the International Tract Society, International Religious Liberty Association, Michigan Tract Society, and General Conference. On the second floor of this part is the Office Chapel, where every Sunday morning before commencing the labors of the week, all the employees of the Office assemble for worship. A meeting for prayer and social worship is held Monday evenings, at the close of the working hours, and is a source of strength to those who attend. Meetings are also held in the chapel on Friday evenings. The employees need a deep work of consecration, for the trust which is com-mitted to their care is of the utmost importance, and demands zeal and fidelity as great at least as that in the field. The prayers of God's people should ascend for the publishing houses and for the employees. FRANK ARMSTRONG. A FAMILY. SAVED. [ONE of our State missionary papers contains the following, which cannot fail to be of deep interest to every reader of.  the REVIEW. This is true missionary work, according to the direc-tions of the Lord in Isa. 58 : 7, 8. Would that more of this kind of work were being done by our people everywhere.Š ED.] " A brother in one of our northwestern counties writes to me how he was directed by the Spirit of God to approach a covered wagon which was camped near by. He says : ' As I approached the wagon, I wondered what I could tell them about the third angel's message and the soon coming of the Lord.' He saw that the family, consisting of father, mother, and five children, were stricken with poverty and unacquainted with God. He said, spoke a few words to the man, and told him everything pointed to the soon coming of the Lord Jesus. I took their address, and as I was turning to go, the man said, "Will you pray for me and my family ? " As I walked away about a hundred yards or so, something said, "Go back and invite them to your home," which I did.' I knew that in a few days our monthly meeting would be at hand, and brother H., one of our ministers, would be with us, so I in-vited them and insisted on their staying with us. I could see that the powers of darkness were work-ing very hard to get them to go on, so I hired  the man, and he was content to stay until the meeting. Then I fitted him out with a suit of clothes of my own, and we went to the meeting, which was a great source of strength and bless-ing to him, for he had not been inside of a meet-ing-house for twelve years. The happy result was, that he then and there found Christ, and now he is rejoicing in the truth. " It would do one good to see how happy he is, and 0 how earnestly he is taking hold of the truth. The family dare so changed they do not look like the same family." Ł pffhil elites.

TENNESSEE RIVER CONFERENCE. ARRANGEMENTS are completed for the return at one third rate of those coming to this Conference and camp-meeting at Nashville, Tenn., Aug. 30 to Sept. 10. This is in case there are not less than 100 persons in attend-ance by rail; and we look for many more than this number. Those attending from points in eastern or western Tennessee, where through tickets to Nashville cannot be procured,, should purchase to Chattanooga or Martin, and there re-purchase to Nashville, taking receipts in both instances. Give these receipts to the Conference secretary on arriving at Nashville. The hard times should not diminish, but rather increase the attendance at this meet-ing. We cannot expect many more of these annual convocations. CHAS. L. BOYD. Pe thou!. "The entrance of thy words giveth light."ŠPs. 119:180. LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE. Lesson 9.Š Christ's Second Coming. Luke 17:20-37. (Sabbath, Sept. 1.) THE title of this lesson will be found sufficient analy-sis of it.

What can men not say about the kingdom? 4. What did he say to his disciples? 5. What will men say in spite of the Lord's instruc-tions? (Compare verse 23 with Matt. 24 :23.) 6. How are we to regard such sayings? 7. What will be the manner of Christ's coming? 8. What did he tell the people must first take place? 9. What did all the prophets speak of as preceding the glorious coming of the Lord? 1 Peter 1 :10, 11. 10. How will it be in the days of the coming of the Lord? 11.
