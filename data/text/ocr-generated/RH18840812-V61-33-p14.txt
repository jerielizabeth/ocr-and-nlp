Of twelve children vaccinated with this virus all escaped on being exposed to the disease. If, as is supposed by  many physicians, the germ of scarlet fever is the same as that of diphtheria, and if Steckler's discovery averts both, he will deserve to rank as high among the ben- NO CAUSE FOR FEAR " Tidings of these things came,"ŠActs 11 :22.

THOSE comingŠIn over the N. Y. Central R. R. can  purchase round trip tickets for our camp-meeting at one and one-half cents- per mile each way with- out presenting any certificate from us. Those coming over the West Shore need a certificate from E. W. Whitney which will enable them to pur- chase a round trip ticket at the same rate. Those coming over the R. W. and 0. and the D. L. and W. R. R. buy regular tickets to Syracuse, and on the camp-ground they will be furnished with a certificate which will enable them to purchase a ticket for return for one cent per mile. Those coming from Oswego, De,Kalb Juction, Ogdens- burg, or Norwood, over the R. W. and 0. R. R. will be furnished with return tickets free.

ŠA noval case of church discipline has arisen in Spencer, Mass. Mr. Ellis Hall, a member of the Baptist church, holding that the parable of Dives and Lazarus describes scenes beyond the present life, and learning that church does not hold this view, wrote a letter withdrawing from church relations. Being told that a member cannot withdraw at will, he has adver-tised that his connection with the church is at an end, in order to test the question whether a member can withdraw " when he believes heresy.has crept into the church." The discussion and adjudication of this problem will be of interest beyond Baptist circles. .'"-..._-"".' C-Ł",,._,._ ---- __-_,--_ _ __._. -__,_,..—_, __ NOTICE TO ILLINOIS. PERSONS coming from Chicago to the camp- meeting at Peoria, can come over the Wabash and St. Louis R. R. for one fare for the round trip, by going to 109, Clark St., and asking of P. A. Palmer, Gen. Agt. W. St. L. and P. R. R. for a round trip ticket to the Seventh-day AdventistY.,Thursday camp-meeting at Peoria. It will be well for our 16° brethren when reachii Ł Peoria not to make any bargains with cab-men, bus-men, or baggage-men, with reference to transferring themselves or bag- gage to the encampment, for we have arranged for with which to transfer much cheaper than they can do. The fair grounds can be reached by street cars, by taking a car at the Union depot and going to Main and Jefferson street-crossing, and then changing to a line that runs direct to the grounds ; or by walking about five blocks north from the depot to the direct line.

ŠDied, June 22, by drowning in Bushard's Bay, near Santa Ana, Los Angeles Co., Cal., John and James Brown, sons of Bro. Daniel Brown. John was aged 24 years, 8 months, and 7 days, and had been married but a few months. James was aged 13 years, 2 months, and 22 days. The mother, the wife of the elder brother, and other members of the family, wit-nesseel the scene from the shore, but were unable to render any assistance. The family were on a fishing excursion, and the boy was swimming in the bay. He called for help, and his brother waded out some dis-tance and handed him a pole, which he grasped, and by some unknown means both were drawn under the water. The bodies were not secured until several days after the occurrence. Funeral services were conducted by Bro. R A.Morton of Orange s ' ' Š N. ..., ELLIE A. BROWN, INDIANA CAMP-MEETINGS. As already announced in REVIEW, there will be two camp-meetings held-in   Indiana. These meet- ings will be the most important ones ever held in the Conference, and we hope every Sabbath-keeper Ł in the State will arrange to be present. The Southern meeting will be held at Farmersburg, Sullivan Co., sixteen miles south of Terre Haute, on 'the line of the Evansville and Terre Haute R. R., on which road we shall probably get a reduction of fare. The meeting will be held Sept. 2-9. As the meeting is to be held only a few miles from the Illinois State line, we would like to have the broth- rep and sisters of Southern Illinois meet withus Ł 1 providing they can do so and not neglect their own State meeting. W e expect a large turn-out and hope we shall not be disappointed. The State camp-meeting and Conference will be held at Logansport, a city of some 14,000 inhabi- tants, and an important railroad center. The city is now being canvassed, and we expect to adver- tise the meeting extensively. The General Con- ference Committee will furnish able ministerial aid. HENDERSON. ŠDied at Reese,Tuscola Co., Mich., July 18, 1884, Bro. Jonathan Henderson, aged 80 years and 5 months. Bro, Henderson was born at Perrinton, Monroe Co., N. Y., Feb. 18, 1804. At the age of twenty-four years he was married to Miss Celecta Woodard, who shared his joys and sorrows until his decease. Of seven children, five still survive. Bro. and Sr. Henderson emigrated to Michigan in 1835. Five years later he professed Christianity, uni- ting with the Christian church at Madison, Lenawee Co., Mich.,' of which he was deacon for ten years. Three years ago, when Eld, Wm. Ostrander and my-self were at Reese with the tent, he accepted the ad-vancing light of Bible truth, and has since tried to obey all the commandments   of God and the faith of Jesus. He died trusting in the Saviour. His corn- panion is cheered by the blessed hope of soon meeting him again in the kingdom of God, Sermon at the funeral from 2 Tim. 4 : 6-8. ALBERT WEEKS. We hope also to secure the attendance of Sr. White. We expect to see a general rally from all parts of the State. Particulars in regare to R. R. fare will be given in the future. S. H. LANE. SHIPTON.
