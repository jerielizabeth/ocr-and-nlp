PUBLISHERS' DERARTMENT. As we are apprised by special communication, the business in-augurated by Mr. Graham, at 744 Broadway, New York City, will still be continued under the old firm name of Andrew J. Gra-ham and Co., Mr Graham's interest remaining. The June num-ber of the Student's Journal, Mr. Graham's own magazine, de-voted to Graham's Standard Phonography, was a memorial number, with a fine photo-engraving of its founder as a frontis- piece. * * * THE MICHIGAN CENTRAL, "The Niagara Falls Route" for the season of 1894, has placed on sale Summer Tourist's tickets to all the principal Summer resorts of Michigan, Canada, and the New England CoaSt resorts, including the Thousand Islands, St. Lawrence River, Berkshire Hills, White Mountains, Adiron-dack Mountains, and Vermont resorts. The magnificent train service of the Michigan Central is unsurpassed in beauty, ele-gance, completeness, and comfort of its equipment, and its fa-mous through trains carry Wagner palace sleeping and parlor cars, and serve meals in their own dining cars. Write or call upon any Michigan Central agent for a copy of their Summer Tourist book and latest folders. * * "WHERE FARMING PAYS."ŠIs it in the Northwest, with wheat at less than 50 cents a bushel, with zero weather, and bliz-zards in winter and cyclones in summer ? Š No ! Go to Virginia ; land is cheap, climate perfect all the year round. Ask any one who knows, and he will tell you that in the tidewater section one acre of land has produced as high as $200o in one season. It is worth looking into. Apply to C. H. Bovee, Gen'l Land and Excursion Agent, Coldwater, Mich., for pamphlet, "Facts for Farmers," free. No statements are made that are not corrob-orated by practical farmers who have grown rich on their Vir- ginia farms. * * * WEATHER IN MICHIGAN.ŠWhile the States of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, the South, and in fact the great part of the United States have been during the last week blistering under a scorching sun and withered by veritable simoons, Michigan has been fanned by cool breezes from the surrounding lakes, and has not experienced a rise of temperature sufficiently great to produce serious discomfort. Michigan is, in fact, an inland island, in which respect it is unique, as there is perhaps no other body of land in the world, of the same size, so peculiarly located. The lakes moderate both the summer's heat and the winter's cold, so that Michigan enjoys the cool, breezy summers of the extreme northwest and the winter temperature of southern Ohio. This peculiarity of this climate which, within the last few years has become more and more extensively known, is doubtless the secret of the growing popularity of Michigan as a health resort. The whole State is, in fact, one great health resort. The hundreds of little lakes which dot its surface, are, at the present season, surrounded with camping parties who find a delightful alternation of rest and exercise in skimming in safety over the glassy surface of the lakes in row or sailboats, or lying beneath the trees upon the breezy grass-covered slopes of the shore. * * * ONE of the leading summer attractions of the Battle Creek Sanitarium is the beautiful lake connected with it, at a distance of only a couple of miles, in sight from the upper stories of the building, and reached at any time by easy conveyance. A large cottage with a dining pavilion large enough to accommodate two  or three hundred guests at once furnishes delightful headquar-ters at the lake, the high banks of which command charming vistas in various directions. Steamers, row and sailboats are con-stantly plying up and down the lake by the landing at the Sani tarium grounds. Patients and guests of the institution arc supplied with rowboats free of cost. There is probably no institu-tion in the country which offers so many country attractions as does the Sanitarium, aside from its superior advantages as a scientific medical institution and as the leading health institution of the country. * * * THE guests of the Sanitarium and the citizens of Battle Creek have been greatly instructed, and entertained from a two days' visit from Bishop Thoburn, the world-famous missionary of India. Bishop Thoburn's great work in India has become known throughout the whole world as the most notable work in chris-tianizing the heathen which has been witnessed since the days of the apostles. For the last two years a steady ingathering at the rate of fifty a day has added nearly 5o,00o converts to the communicants of the Methodist Church in India under Bishop Thoburn's management. The Bishop's missiyn in this country is to gather funds for the carrying forward of this special evange-lizing effort and for the support of his numerous schools into which 2000 pupils have been already gathered within the last two years. In these schools such great economy is practiced, and such careful management prevails that ten boys or girls can be clothed, fed, taught, and cared for for the small sum of $loo a year. Here is a grand opportunity for persons who are philanthropically inclined to do a vast deal of good with very little money. The editor of this journal would be glad to hear from any one who is interested in this work, and will cheerfully give such further in-formation as may be required by those who wish to be put in communication with the conductors of this vast humanitarian enterprise. * * * THE BEAUTY OF NIAGARA can never be described, and it has never been pictured so ade-quately and satisfactorily as in the splendid portfolio just issued by the Michigan Central, "The Niagara Falls Route." It con-tains fifteen large plates from the very best instantaneous photo-graphs, which cannot he bought for as many dollars. All these can be bought for ten cents at the Michigan Central Ticket Office. * * * WHERE TO LOCATE NEW FACTORIES. THIS is the title of a 150-page pamphlet recently published by the Passenger Department of the Illinois Central Railroad, and should be read by every mechanic, capitalist, and manufacturer. It describes in detail the manufacturing advantages of the prin-cipal cities and towns on the line of the Southern Division of the Illinois Central, and the Louisville, New Orleans, and Texas Rail-roads, and indicates the character and amount of substantial aid each city or town is willing to contribute. It furnishes conclu-sive proof that the South possesses advantages for the establish-ment of every kind of factory working wool, cotton, wood, or clay.
