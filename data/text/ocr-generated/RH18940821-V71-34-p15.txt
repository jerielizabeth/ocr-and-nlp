LEIGHTON. -Died at Otsego, Mich., July' 28, 1894, sister Ettie Leighton, aged 32 years, 2 months, and 19 days. It can truly be said of her that she died at her post. She was at church on the Sabbath, and had just led the school in singing, and was hearing her class, when she had a stroke of paralysis of the heart. She fell backward, and in a few moments the struggle was over. The church at Otsego has lost a faithful member, and the elder of the church a devoted wife. The citi-zens of Otsego gave evidence that they had sustained a great loss. Hundreds of them attended the funeral. Discourse by the writer, from 1 Cor. 15 : 57. W. OSTRANDER. NORTON!-Died in Wasioja, Minn., July 1, 1894, of cancer, Henry W. Norton. He was born in Oswego county, N. Y., June 7, 1825. He was one of twelve brothers and sisters, five of whom survive him. He came from New York to Waupun, Wis., where, in 1848, he married Miss Sarah M. Garrison, who, with two sons and two daughters, still lives. In the fall of 1855, he came to Minnesota and located on the farm where he lived and died. His early Christian relations were with the Freewill Baptists; later, he was con-nected with the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and oc-cupied a leading position in connection with their educational work. About seventeen years ago, his atten-tion was called directly to the third angel's message. After a patient and somewhat protracted study, he took a stand with those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, and his faith in the message grew more clear and firm unto the end. He united with the Dodge Center church. For several years he was actively engaged in every enterprise which tended to the building up of the church and the advancement of the cause. Circumstances led him fov a time to withdraw from active  coUllection With.  the work; but in the last year or two, the clouds lifted, and the skies brightened above him, and When his sun set, it was in a cloudless sky. His sufferings for more than a year, no tongue nor pen can describe; but he bore them with a heroism which nothing short of the grace of God could inspire. His closing days were given to deep heart-searching, and though unable, by reason of partial paralysis of his vocal organs, to make himself fully understood, he gave satisfactory and comforting evidence that he was at peace with God and with all mankind, and the Lord mercifully relieved him of pain, so that his end was calm and peaceful. The funeral was held the day following, and was largely attended. It was conducted by Elder W. A. Alway, assisted by brother Vankirk, and Elder Cox of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Elder Alway spoke words of com- fort from Rev.14 : 13. D. P. CURTIS. GOING EAST. Bead Doses. STATIONS.
