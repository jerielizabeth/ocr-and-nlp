614 lc THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. Vol. 20, No. 39. eons act in a man's life is that much death. A man's life, like the fountain, is made im-pure by one unrighteous act. He may think he has some good in his life because he can bring to mind some good things he has done. So a man may say, there is good water in his well that has a vein of pure water flowing into it. But if. there is another smaller vein of brackish water flowing into it at the same time, it will be difficult for him to prove that his well contains good water by asking his friend to taste and see. So it is with our righteousness. If it be only a small portion of unrighteousness that is there, we may be assured that the whole fountain is contami-nated. "We are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment." Isa. 64: 6, Revised Ver-sion. If our past life has been all unrighteousŠ"there is none that doeth good, no, not one" Šwhat effect will justification have on our future life? If all our past unrighteous life is blotted out, are we in ourselves any better able to live a better life in the future than we were before? Does it put any goodness into us to pronounce a past sinful life righteous? Is it not here that many honest souls are stranded on the shoals of legalism? While trying to steer clear of the rocks of antinomi-anism on one side, some have run their bark into the mire of legalism on the other. If we would keep our eyes off from both these er-rors, and turn them toward the Polar Star, Christ Jesus, we might have much more joy. It is very difficult to distinguish which has the least joy, the soul that is indifferent to all the claims of God's law, and expecting sal-vation while living in sin, or he who is con-stantly trying to be good, and sinning and confessing all the time with his efforts to be righteous. (Concluded next week.) -Ł DESOLATIONS AND BURNINGS OF THE EARTH. BY ELDER WM. COVERT. As THE antediluvian earth and world met with desolation on account of sin, so must the present age close with a breaking up of all things upon it, that sinners may be removed and the iniquity purged out of It. Says our Saviour:Š "For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be." Matt. 24: 38, 39. "Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed." Luke 17 : 28-30. As truly as destruction and desolation re-sulted from the visitations of the judgments described above, so must there be seen like things when Jesus comes. A general righting up will be necessary that the earth may be. fitted for the final abode of the righteous. When the prophet looked down through time upon the scenes with which this age shall end, he saw the earth without form and void, and when he looked upon the heavens they had no light.' The mountain's trembled and the hills were moved. There was no man left upon the earth, and the birds of the heavens had fled. The fruit- ful place had become a wilderness, and the cities of the earth were broken down. See Jer. 4 : 23-26. The earth was made waste and empty, and then turned upside down, and the land ut-terly emptied and utterly spoiled. Isa. 24: 1-3. The scene is one of time most desolate and dreadful that the universe will ever behold. The indignation of the Lord will be upon all nations, and his fury upon their armies. They will be delivered to the slaughter, for the prophet says, "It is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the Year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion." Isa. 34 :8. The hosts of evil will try with all the energy of desperation to keep possession of the earth. But the armory of heaven will destroy every hiding place, and break up all their entrench-ments. John in his vision saw the islands flee away, and the mountains were not found. This was the result of a mighty earthquake. See Rev. 16 :18-20. David had a view of the same, and his testimony is that the mountains will be carried into the midst of the sea. Ps. 46:1-3 (study the whole psalm). The touch of sin is so vile and its pollu-tions so detestable that God will not settle his redeemed children upon the earth until it has been thoroughly purged from the foul stains of the devil and all his followers. "He will thoroughly purge his floor, . . . and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." Matt. 3 : 12. Sin has entered deep down in its pollutions. The prophet saw the iniquity of the wicked resting upon their bones in their graves. Eze. 32: 27. To reach and cleanse the earth from this defilement a fire will bekindled which shall burn to the lowest hell (sheol, grave). It will even set on fire "the founda-tions of the mountains." Deut. 32: 22. The upheavals described in the sacred scrip-tures quoted in this article *ill expose to the purifying fires of the judgment day every,de-filement not purged by the blood of Christ and purified by the glory of God's grace. All the works of sin, together with all who re, main with their sins, including Satan him-self, must be consumed. This means will be _applied in the destruction of sin and the clearing away of its poison. Would that all sinners might, before it is too late, learn the strength of that kind hand which they now oppose. If they but knew the might and love of Him against whom they war, would not their rebellion cease and loyalty adorn their life? Be assured that the hand which is so mighty to destroy, is the strength of his peo-ple, the Saviour of the meek who trust him. For them he has prepared a city of refuge from the-dreadful storm of fire and brimstone, a solid place which cannot be affected by the coming earthquake, an ark that will be as secure against billows of fire as was that which Noah built against the deluge. Se-cure a place in the ark of safety before the approaching storm cloud compels the keeper to close its doors. THE LIMITATION OF MEN. ONE of the sure ways of accomplishing too little is by expecting too much: To one who knows men, no truth is more patent than the limitations of men of power. Some men are so profound that we despair of measuring their possibilities; but they are like the narrow vein of gold-bearing quartz,Švery deep down  they go, but the line on each side of them is a hard, fast line of limitation. Other men cover vast fields and wide ranges of learning and power, so that, as we survey them, their capabilities outrun the horizon of our view. But only a few inches or yards below this promising surface is a definite line of limita-. tion. They are only a thin stratum. Both sorts, and mixed sorts, and all sorts must be. viewed and estimated by their limitations, as well as their capabilities. No power, human or other, can be utilized to the best advantage, if we lose sight of the lines of limitation. Within those lines of limit any power can be developed to unlimited effectiveness and util-ity.ŠS. S. Times. '1 Ł DEMONOLATRY. BY ELDER I. E. KIMBALL. THE more evident extravagances of the monks, the wild, frenzied imagination, the uncouth appearance, have been considered, ,together with the licentiousness, hypocrisy, and the pitiful delusion under which they operated. We can but, feel a vivid disgust when thinking of their hawking about dead men's bones, relics, etc., as a panacea for every ill. Even Augustine in the latter part of his life could-but feel disgusted with them. Thus he said:Š The devil hath dispersed in every corner such a crew of hypocrites, under the habit of monks, gad-ding about every country, sent no whither, staying nowhere, everywhere restless, whether sitting or standing. Some sell the limbs of martyrs (if so be of martyrs), and all are asking, all expecting, either the expenses of a gainful poverty, or the hire of a counterfeit sanctity.ŠDe Opere Monacharam, cap. 28. Thus we see, "under the habit of monks," Augustine acknowledged many hypocrites, who "spake lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron." Such persons played pranks and palmed them off for miracles, rehearsing the day before. What can we expect of such an one with the keys of a convent at his belt, simply that he might roll in the mire of fornication. The coarse, brutal, benumbed mind revealed nothing of that transformation whereby we may "show what is that good and acceptable and per-fect will of God." The mass released from the burden of sin, or regeneration, came by "holy baptism," not the Spirit of God. And what shall we say of the massŠthe breaden god of those times?ŠIt was a sort of image worship or relic worship. As the dead martyr took possession of a statue, or manifested himself in his bones, or relics, so Christ was in the bread and wine, and that horrid idea of transubstantiation, whereby the blood be-came "body, blood, and divinity," took pos-session of the mind. To say the least, it is idolatry pure and simple. "Holy baptism" became the sprinkling of holy water. It was used in very nearly all the heathen mysteries, as Dr. Newton, in the March number of the Forum, 1886, plainly showed. In all heathen-dom it was the sign of "spiritual regenera-tion." In some of the forms of Buddhism the newborn babe was dipped in sacred water three times, and then the name given. So did the ancient Persian to his babe. The Mithraic mysteries had a similar service for time adults. The Egyptians had time same rites in the mysteries of Isis, whose priests were cloistered monks.. The water was known as the "water of ablution," and the person was thus "regenerated." The sprinkling of holy
