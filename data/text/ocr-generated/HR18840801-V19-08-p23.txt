toor) 247 Mouth-Breathing. Š Few persons are aware that this practice, so very com-mon, is specially harmful, and may be surprised when we say that it is exceed-ingly detrimental to health, even danger-ously so. It is generally due to obstruc-tions in the nasal cavities, either through thickening or swelling of the mucous membrane, or the existence of polypi or other morbid growths. Sometimes it is due to habit merely. A child catches cold. The nasal passages become ob-structed, necessitating mouth-breathing during sleep, when respiration is involun-tary, and hence less forcible than during the waking hours. The cold is.soon re-covered from, but the habit has been con-tracted, and is continued even to adult years, or during an entire life-time. Enlargement of the tonsils is also a common cause of mouth-breathing. Habitual mouth-breathing ultimately results in serious disease of the throat and larynx. It is also the cause of the peculiar malformation of the chest known as " pigeon's breast." The remedy consists in the application of such measures as will remove the ob-structions, if present. Polypi must be removed. Morbid growths must be re-moved or destroyed. Catarrh, if present, must be cured. If mouth-breathing is a habit merely, as is often the case, espe-cially with children, care should be taken to instruct the child to breathe through the nose, and when it goes to sleep, the lips should be gently closed. By perse-verance, the habit may be cured. Money Counters' Disease.ŠMoney count-ers of the Treasury Department at Wash-ington are frequently found to be suffering with a disease of the hands and face, due to poisoning from the arsenic used in the printing inks. ŠThe Philadelphia Record reports the case of a young man who fainted in a horse car in that city in consequence of the tightness of his pantaloons. ŠThe Boston Journal is responsible for the astonishing statement that " recent examinations of a large number of wells used for drinking-water in different sec-tions of New Hampshire, shows that nine-ty-five per cent of them are contaminated." ŠObservations upon the habits of bees have shown that they maintain a regular system of ventilation in their hives, by means of relays of bees, stationed at vari-ous points, which produce a current of air by the rapid motion of their wings. ŠA New York woman makes a busi-ness of treating wrinkles. One of the essential parts of her treatment is the ad-vice, "You must not frown." Ladies over thirty, who are afraid of wrinkles, should bear this in mind. ŠAccounts of death from trichinosis are becoming almost as frequent as of rail-road accidents and bankrupt speculators. Ought we hot to ask for a legislative adop-tion of the old Mosaic statute prohibiting the eating of pork? ŠThe oleomargarine business still con-tinues in full blast. Large quantities of the stuff are being shipped to Holland. The stearine obtained in the process is used to adulterate lard and beeswax, and the refuse is fed to chickens. ŠA set of test-types ought to be placed in every school, so that the first beginning of optical .defects in the eye may be de-tected by the inability of the student to read the letters at proper distances. ŠIt is reported that a disease resem-bling leprosy has attacked the fish in Scot-land. So large a proportion as twenty per cent of the salmon in some of the rivers is affected. ŠInvestigations conducted in England show a marked increase in the frequency of cancer in that country.
