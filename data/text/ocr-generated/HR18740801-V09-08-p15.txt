 THE HEALTH REFORMEirt. 23S  text-books now recognize this fact more gener-ally than they did a few years ago. We find that the number of " self-limiting " diseases is greater in proportion than formerly. In civilized countries we can seldom determine what nature can accomplish for herself, so eager are all to assist or supersede her efforts by med-icine. Among savages we see what she can do alone, and we find that she does her work well. The Esquimaux, whose pharmacopoeia is ex-ceedingly scanty, will contrive to recover from their various ills, and reach a longevity equal to that of their more civilized neighbors. If to drugs, and not to nature, is to be given the credit of healing disease, then where drugs are the most constantly and scientifically prescribed, there should be the least sickness, the most speedy recovery, the most stalwart frames and the longest lives. In wealthy cities, where the science of med-icine is supposed to have reached its greatest per-fection, there should be found men and women of muscle and endurance; while in the forest, where nature is allowed to practice the healing art, we should expect to find puny, pale-faced, cadaver-ic, so-called intellectual-looking men and women suffering from all the different grades of nerv-ous debility. The opposite is true. The In-dian, whose only medicine for every ailment is kis decoction of herbs, the Patagonian, who probably never heard of medicine, has better health, can endure more hardship, and will live longer than his civilized neighbor who has hourly access to the chemist's shop. If medicines are as effective as has been pop-ularly supposed, we should naturally expect to find a great difference in the results of the practice of skillful and unskillful physicians. The man of superior intellect would take the same rank as physician, in the popular estima-tion, when compared with his less talented as-sociates, as he would take in the professions of law or theology. This, however, is not the case. It is true that the highly scientific phy-sician cannot fail to be recognized as such, but the fact will not be brought to light by his suc-cess in the practice of his profession. We have a right to assume that the acquisition of a large and flourishing practice by any physician is an evidence that his patients are as successfully treated, at least, as the average. Now we should expect that the skill in the treatment of disease shown by the highly educated physi-cian would be so manifestly superior to that of one less thoroughly educated, that the extent of his practice would correspond with the ex-cellence of his attainments. Such, however, is not the fact. We find that in the practice of medicine, more than in any other profession, the success of the physician in acquiring prac-tice depends not so much upon his superior ed-ucation as.upon his pleasing address, his portly and imposing form, and his skill in adapting the amount of " palaver " to the respective fac- ulties of each particular patient. The scientific  and highly educated physician is recognized, it. is true, but only as every other intelligent man is recognizedŠnot by his superior success and skill in the administration of drugs. The fact that he is educated, and that for this reason he ought to be skillful, will perhaps increase his business, but not in the ratio we might expect. The most impudent and presuming charlatan will often acquire a practice which a modest physician, with such attainments as would give him a front rank in any other profession, will be unable to obtain. The most ignorant pill-maker will never lack for testimonials, certify-ing that his particular pill, whatever its compo-sition may be, will cure diseases of the greatest. variety and virulence ; and his success is as-sured if he can only obtain the means to ad-vertise his patent medicine. This could never be accomplished if there were a very percepti-ble difference between the success of the pill and some more scientific method of treatment We argue, from this fact, no special virtue in the patent medicine, but an absence of it in the medicines more carefully prescribed. We ar-gue from the success of the charlatan, not the. value of the drugs, but the worthlessness of many prescribed by the educated physician. The fact that even among scientific physi-cians such a variety of medicines is recom-mended in almost every disease, that such a.  complexity of combinations is prescribed, that. often no well-defined plan of treatment is uni-versally agreed upon, but that each physician selects and experiments for himself, and the fact that, in spite of all this, the result appears about the same, indicate that either all forms of treatment are like successful, or that none ac-complish the result, which is due to some other-cause. The probability that the latter hypoth-esis is the true one is increased, when we re-member that even in incurable diseases the number of medicines recommended is often great. The history of medicine for the last fifty years tells a tale either of great errors in the early practice of the period, or of just as great in the present, or it shows that methods of practice professedly at variance can be alike successful. Not many years ago, calomel was considered the indispensable drug in practice. The physician without calomel was the artillery-man without his ammunitionŠSamson shorn of his locks. The tongues that were swollen, the teeth that were loosened, the gums that. were made tender, modern physicians say, will present a horrible array of testimony when doctors get their deserts for malpractice. ButŁ the men who believed the patient was nothing unless he was biliousŠwho believed that there was but one organ in the body, and that the liver, and that this was to be unlocked at stated intervals, and entered, and swept, and garnished.
