GOOD FIE-Iikr.,Łrm. 231       BUTCHER OR BAKER? THERE is remarkable vitality in a ques-tion, which, after twenty-five hundred years of agitation, comes up smiling and vigorous before the bar of public opinion. According to historical records, in the year 607 B. c., the king of Babylon be-sieged Jerusalem, and succeeded in cap-turing the king of Judah, as well as a num-ber of his subjects. Instead of putting his captives to death, in the orthodox style of old kings, the conqueror selected four -of the wisest and strongest among them, with a view to educating them in the high-est style of the art of education as it ob-tained at that period. He was in no hur-ry, however; and before their higher edu-cation began, he determined that the four should be as strong and healthy in body as it was possible to make them. To this end, he gave orders that their bodies be carefully attended to for three years, and they be fed on the same food, meats, and wines as he consumed himself. At the end of three years they were to come be-fore him for inspection. A eunuch named Ashpenaz was responsible for their wel-fare, having been given plainly to under-stand that if the captives did not present a first-class, A 1 appearance at the end of the preparatory period, his head would be shorn from his shoulders. Under the circumstances, imagine the chagrin, not to say terror, of Ashpenaz, when one of the captives positively re-fused to eat a morsel of meat of any kind! " But you must eat meat and drink wine, my dear sir!" cried Ashpenaz, in ef-fect. " If you do not do so, you will grow weak and emaciated; your face will look sad, and when the king takes note of your appearance, my head will be in danger." It was in vain that the captive, Daniel by name, declared meat to be a curse in-stead of a blessing, and assured Ashpenaz that he would thrive much better on a vegetable than on an animal diet. The eunuch had no faith in such doctrine ; but finally, in order to convince Daniel of his mistake, he consented to make a test of the matter for ten days, and for that length of time he fed the four captives upon pulse (wheat) and water alone, while foar others were fed upon meats from the king's table. At the end of ten days the vegetarians were fairer, fatter, and more vigorous in every, way than the flesh-eaters. Con-vinced by the testimony of his own eyes, Ashpenaz was won over. For three years, Daniel and his companions subsisted upon pulse and water. When, on the appointed day, they were presented before the king, the vigor of their frames, and the beauty and health shining in their faces so pleased him that heŠbut we have no space for the continuation of the story. It may be found in the first and succeeding chapters of the book of Daniel. It is enough that we have shown how highly the nourishing qualities in a grain of wheat were appre-ciated twenty-five centuries ago. Of course, the bread at that time was manufactured in such a primitive manner that its nourishing qualities can compare in no way with the bread upon our tables to-day, especially that upon the tables of those who use flour manufactured from hard Minnesota wheat, by the newly-dis-covered process of milling without mill stonesŠthe Hungarian process. To quote from the New York Sun, of May 11, 1884: " Take a grain of wheat, view it through the microscope, and what do you see 7ŠA rough, bristling structure, as shaggy as the bark of an old oak, much dust and dirt, many insects' eggs stored away in the crev-ices, and shaggy hairs on one end that hold in their embrace any quantity of dirt. You feel certain that these substances were never designed for human food. Chem-istry indicates nothing nutritive in wheat shells (bran), and even the flavor of the grain is absent. You put some of the bran in your mouth, and the particles of glass (for that is what they are) furrow into the membranes, and irritate and in-flame them. " To-day, instead of the old mill-stone, rollers made of steel or chilled iron are used, and the wheat is reduced to flour by several successive breaks. By this method,Šthe Hungarian process,Šnoth-ing goes into the flour barrel but the pure flour." In their bread, Daniel and his compan-ions necessarily devoured the dirt and wheat shells described above, and in con-sequence, to an extent, failed to get as much benefit from the pulse diet as' we get to-day. In fact, the new process of milling is the only one which furnishes flour perfectly free from the glassy parti-cles of bran, and hence it is only for the past few years that we have been able to have perfect bread. If the baker could prove his food products superior in point of nutriment to those of the butcher thou-sands of years ago, how much more easily can he do the same to-day!
