530 ADVENT REVIEW AND SABBATH HERALD. 2[VoL. 71, No. 34. abroad, he hath given to the poor ; his right-eousness remaineth forever. Now he that min-istereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;) enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which eauseth through us thanksgiving to God." Let every believer in the truth for this time, awake to duty. Instead.. of studying how to gratify yourselves and follow your inclination, study how you may imitate Christ in self-denial, and thus be able to help and to save the pur-chase of his blood. Relieve the wants of the needy, and work to help the weak and the poorer sister churches. The Lord has made us his almoners. He places in our hands his gifts, in order that we shall divide with those who are needy, and it is this practical giving that will be to us a sure panacea for all selfishness. By thus expressing love to those who need help, you will cause the hearts of the needy to give thanks-giving unto God because he has bestowed the grace of benevolence upon the brethren, and has caused them to relieve the necessities of the needy. It is through the exercise of this practical love that the churches draw nearer together in. Christian unity. Through the love of the brethren, love to God is increased, be-cause he has not forgotten those who were in distress, and thus thank-offerings ascend to God for his care. ''For the ministration of this serv-ice not only supplicth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God." The faith of the brethren is increased in God, and they are led to commit their souls and bodies unto God as to a faithful Creator. " While by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men." Giving for the necessity of the saints and for the advancement of the kingdom of God, is preaching practical sermons, which testify that those who give have not received the grace of God in vain. A living example of an unselfish character, which is after the example of Christ, has great power upon men. Those who do not live for self, will not use up every dollar meet-ing their supposed wants, and supplying their conveniences, but will bear in mind that they are Christ's followers, and that there are others who are in need of food and clothing. Those who live to gratify appetite and selfish desire, will lose the favor of God, and will lose the heavenly reward. They testify to the world that they have not genuine faith, and when they seek to impart to others a knowledge of present truth, the world will regard their words as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Let every one show his faith by his works. " Faith without works is dead," "being alone." "Wherefore show yeŁ to them and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting in, your behalf." I have given you a brief sketch of my dis-course to the Sydney church. After the ser-mon we had a most precious social meeting. W. C. White spoke, presenting some precious thoughts, and many melting testimonies were borne. The meeting was blessed of God, and we knew that Jesus was in the midst, and by his Holy Spirit was moving upon hearts. We were soon in our carriage again, returning to Granville. How is it with my brethren and sisters in America l How much do you practice self-de-nial in order that you may show liberality to the needy cause of God at this time l We are doing our work here under great pressure for the want of the very money that many of the members- of our churches are expending upon their own fan-cies, in pleasing and gratifying themselves. If they had accepted the testimonies I have borne to them concerning the great want in these re-gions beyond, they would not be found expend-ing one dollar in following the example of those  who are multiplying pictures of themselves and their families. You would not be purchasing bicycles, which you could do without, but would be receiving the blessing of God in exercising your physical powers in a less expensive way. Instead of in vesting one hundred dollars in a bicycle, you would consider the matter well, lest it might be at the price of souls for whom Christ died, and for whom he has made you responsible. Please read Isaiah 58, and see what is a sure remedy for poor health. Satan will contrive to bring about many devices to absorb the means which should be devoted to the cause of God at this time. We cannot open new fields in regions beyond, for want of the very means that is used up in various ways, which might be given to des-titute missions. God would have you invest in a fund to erect humble houses of worship for those who have newly come to the faith, who cannot possibly command means to do this, on account of their great poverty. Their souls are just as pre-cious as your soul ; and could you pass through the experience through which we have passed since coming to this country, you would bind about your supposed wants, and would be ready to help to build humble houses of worship in regions beyond. You would have the satisfac-tion of denying inclination in thus investing means in the cause of God. Night after night, we have studied the perplexing problem of how we should obtain the means to advance the work of God. It rests with you in America to solve this puzzling question. " For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh; (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ;) casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." JUDGE NOT. 13Y FRED ALLISON ROWE. (Battle Creek, Mich.) THE conditions of human life demand a cer-tain degree of self-reliance in every man whose life is to be of any great consequence to others or to himself. When one distrusts his ability to meet any contingency advantageously, he ren-ders himself less able to do so. To doubt is to breathe life into our fears, and to deliver our-selves into their possession. Endowed with ca-pabilities of judgment and action, it is right for a man to regard them as the instruments of his labor and to place some dependence upon them. If the mystery of life continues after hope's last ember has turned to ashes in the heart and left it cold and dark, it is but a sluggish use-less sort of living. God is good, and all good is of God. Faith and belief are not quite syn-onymous ; we may believe in the existence of evil, but we have faith only in the good. A good man desires only those things which he thinks are good, and if his judgment were per-fect, he would always desire the absolutely good. To have such faith and such desire, is to have hope, and hope has wings to lift the soul, that it may see beyond the highest mountain wall of this earth-life of ours, and catch glimpses of a brighter and untrodden path. Without hope, life is merely the means of continued misery, and is worse than oblivion ; but since faith is a necessary element of hope, life is also as useless without faith as without hope. Every rational human being has faith in something, believes in something,Š in the power of wealth, in his own powers of body or mind, in the loyalty of friends, in the stability of nature, in the goodness and omnipotence of God. There are men who sometimes deny that they believe in anything, but their actions speak more truly,:and:proclaim them self-deceived or insin,  cere. The fabric of society and of civilization itself would crumble in a day if all faith should be stricken from human breasts. It may be that the infidel can honestly doubt the existence of God, for possibly a man may be too blind to see the Creator's hand in created things ; yet even self-proclaimed infidels repose confidence in the laws and works of God ; for they speak of to-morrow's sunrise with assurance. No really serious-minded and reasonable person can candidly regard life as a game of chance ; the illustrations of cause and effect are too common to permit such a view. Every earnest and right effort of any man postulates a faith that this is Ł a universe of order, governed by law, in which justice is administered, though it may sometimes seem delayed. He must indeed be blind who cannot see the operations of laws higher than human laws, and he must be miserable indeed who cannot believe in justice as a finality of all things. Anarchy is the reign of disorder, of hatred over fear in human communities ; and when human law is inoperative, and justice is openly and commonly violated, people become incapable of anything good. So a believer in universal an-archy, supposing all results attained by chance, regarding final justice as a myth, lacks all motive of earnest effort. We must regard our faculties as heaven-born and usable in a universe where justice reigns, or all our lives will lack energy, and will be complete failures for lack of faith. Yet he who looks with perfect confidence to his own strength is either inexperienced or in-capable of learning by experience. Belief in personal infallibility, with all its implications, egotism, selfishness, magnified images of self-importance, is an act of folly and vanity ; for experience is continually impressing this lesson upon perceptive minds : Whoever trusts him-self exclusively will be betrayed ; and supposed friends sometimes prove untrue. We finally come to discover that of all laws, justice, loyalty, and power, man's is least of all to be relied upon. Unhappy is he whose learning stops,with this,Šwho has not learned the further truth that there is, after all, a solid basis of faith in humanity ; that God did not create man evil ; that, divinely aided, man is capable of truth. To live without faith is to vegetate, to breathe in so many cubit feet of air dwring so many use-less, lingering years and months and days. No man lives that way very long. To have faith that we, unaided, can do all things, is to exhibit our inability. The right degree and quality of faith in ourselves comes only through faith in God's goodness and omnipotence. Not only is man's power of execution limited, but his judgment is fallible; and his failures are always traceable to mistaken conclusions. There is nothing more offensive in human char-acter than an over-weaning confidence in one's own judgment. It gives rise to the habit of passing judgment upon the actions and motives of men, against which the Scriptures are full of exhortations. It is a common thing to hear the motives of others aspersed, though their errors may be but the results of mistaken judgment, the very possibility of which the critic overlooks in himself. Let us be careful how we constitute ourselves judges, juries, and executioners, and try or con-demn without trial, the culprit whose human falli-bility led him into error, if he has erred. How wise we sometimes are in our own conceit ! How sure that another's motives were of satanic black-ness ! How ready we are to banish him into desolation ! And then we, having cast the stone at the sinner,Šwe, pure and sinless, say, Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive ; be merciful, our Father, as we are merciful. If God were no better than we, we would be cursed with that prayer on our lips. ButŠ " There 's a wideness in God's mercy, Like the wideness of the sea" though there is often a meanness in man's
