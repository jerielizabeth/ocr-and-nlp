252 THE HEALTH REFORMER. right ? In general we think experience supports the latter position ; but it cannot be doubted that the immediate change is more successful in some cases. Let us examine, briefly, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods. Those who advocate sudden changes in diet argue that if a person is doing that which injures him, the sooner he stops, the better. A very plausible argument, certainly ; but in taking this position, certain influences which have a powerful bearing upon questions pertaining to diet are wholly ignored. For instance, it is well known that by long-continued habit the system may be-come so accustomed to the presence of substances once very obnoxious that they will be tolerated without resistance, and even appear to be recog-nized as beneficial. The use of salt is a good il-lustration of this. When a person has been long accustomed to its use it seems to aid materially in supporting some of the principal vital processes. When it is entirely withdrawn, digestion becomes deranged, and a general enervation of the whole system is felt in consequence. The reason of this is that salt is a stimulant ; and when the stomach is deprived of its usual, though unnecessary, stim-ulus, it at first refuses to perform its accustomed labor. Again, it is a matter of frequent observation that the mental faculties exert a most powerful influence upon the vital processes ; upon digestion, especially. This is the reason why a relish for food is necessary to its prompt digestion. And it is often the case that when the use of salt, or any other favorite condiment is suddenly relinquished, digestion suffers, and the appetite fails, just be-cause the sense of taste is not gratified. Some people of very strong wills can overcome this difficulty and compel their gustatory sense to submit readily to the promptings of reason. Such persons may make as sudden a change as they please. But other individuals of less powerful wills, or stronger appetites, cannot so easily con-trol their natural appetences and may suffer mate-rially, in consequence. Such ones should make a gradual change, by steadily decreasing the amount of the condiments employed in the food untilŁthey can be wholly dropped without being missed. In this way spice, salt, and, to a great extent, sugar, may be abandoned in a short time. There are very few, in truth, who could not make even the most radical and sudden change without difficulty if they were placed under right circumstances. Suppose a person to be cast away on some lone island where none of the accustomed refinements of cookery were by any means attain-able, although an abundance of nutritious food in the form of edible fruits and vegetables could be obtained ; who will say that a person under such circumstances would pine and famish because he must eat his potatoes without salt and his fruits without sweetening  I  We imagine that necessity  would soon prove sufficiently appetizing to over-come any slight remonstrances on the part of the palate, while the stomach would readily adapt it-self to the change. The strongest arguments which extreme and ultra hygienists can urge against the gradual plan of making dietetic changes is the fact that many persons who make the attempt in this manner for-get the importance of constant, prolonged, and persevering efforts, and allow themselves to rest contented after taking only the initiatory steps toward a reformation. Many of those who attempt to reform only ex-change one bad habit for another. It is no re-formation to exchange light, sweet, fine-flour bread for heavy, perhaps sour, graham bread, or " gems " impregnated with saleratus and saturated with burnt grease, as is often the case. Substitut-ing large quantities of sugar, sirup, or molasses, for meat, is not advancement, but a terrible ret-rograde instead. Banishing butter from the ta-ble and then saturating the gems, pie crust, pota-toes, and griddle cakes with suet is no improve-ment. How many would-be health reformers have made themselves dyspeptics by attempting to reform in so unphilosophical, not to say absurd and ridiculous, a way ! The following paragraph we take from the Hy-gienic Cook Book :Š " In commencing the change, discard the worst articles of diet first. Spices, vinegar, pickles, preserves, mustard, peppersauce, old cheese, and similar articles, may be discontinued at once and forever. Pork and all its products may be aban-doned equally as promptly. Exchange fine-flour for graham bread. Next attack the tea and cof-fee habit, reducing the quantity for a few weeks at first, if necessary, but being sure to rout the enemy. Curtail the butter and salt, and use only a moderate quantity of meat. By degrees these may be relinquished. Nuts may be freely used instead of butter. Sweet fruits may also be largely substituted for sugar. In the course of a few months, a person may thus easily become a thorough hygienist if he will constantly keep in view the ideal standard of a true reformer, which demands ultimate freedom from every habit which. is the result of perverted taste, or departure of any kind from the strict observance of the laws of nature." RECIPE FOR MAKING GEMS. Š" Into one part of cold soft water stir two parts of rather coarsely ground graham flour made from the best white wheat. Sift slowly in with one hand while stir-ring with the other, thus endeavoring to get in as much air as possible. If the flour is made from red wheat, a little more than two parts of meal will be required. The batter should always be thick enough so that it will not settle flat. If it is too thin, the biscuit will be likely to be flat and blistered ; if too thick, they will be tough and heavy. Bake in a quick oven."
