GENERAL HYGIENE. 233 4 4i N MEN WANTED.Š The following lines from the pen of that versatile physician, Oliver Wendell Holmes, expresses one of the greatest wants of the time : Š " God give us men ! A time like this demands Great hearts, strong minds, true faith, and willing hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill ; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will ; Men who have honor, men who will not lie ; For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions and little deeds, Wraggle in selfish strife Š lo ! Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps." HINDOO VEGETARIANS.Š Mozoomdar, the famous Hindoo lecturer, describes the Hindoo meal as a very simple affair. According to him, every high caste Hindoo is a vegetarian. He criticises some American vegetarians, who, he claims, are not vegetarians at all, since they eat eggs, sometimes fish, grease, lard, and soups and broths of doubtful com-position. Evidently he has met poor representations of American vegetarians. A genuine vegetarian abhors lard, fish, and " broths of doubtful composi-tion" as much as the high caste Hindoo, though he does not entirely object to eggs. The Hindoo vege-tarian, according to Mozoomdar, excludes from his dietary all substances except butter, milk, sugar, flour, rice, pulse, and herbs. We are not able to recognize the consistency in condemning eggs and allowing the use of milk and butter, since milk and butter are of animal origin as well as eggs, and the use of eggs need not necessarily involve the taking of life, even in a remote sense, since a large portion of eggs are infertile, and hence have no prospect ahead of them for taking part in the activity of the world, unless they are so fortunate as to be incorporated into the structure of some human body. But there really seems little occasion for the use of eggs, certainly none for the use of either flesh food or "broth of doubtful composition," when one is supplied with so liberal a bill of fare as that of the vegetarian Hindoo. When one considers the many varieties of grains, the numerous and exceedingly nourishing varieties of pulse, and the great number of toothsome and succulent herbs which nature affords, to say nothing about the almost endless variety of luscious fruits, there seems to be no excuse whatever for the taking of animal life: Mr. Mozoomdar tells us, however, that the list of foods enumerated as constituting the dietary of the Hindoo vegetarian, is much greater than is used by the ordinary people, as few are sufficiently well-to-do to afford so varied a diet. The food of the com-mon people consists almost exclusively of unleavened bread, stewed peas, beans or lentils, or rice with  vegetables. The Hindoos of Bombay and Madras are exceedingly strict, not only in regard to absti-nence from meat in every form, but in the observance of all their religious ceremonies. The native rises at four o'clock in the morning and goes to bed at from nine to ten o'clock, thus giving himself only six or seven hours for sleep. Notwithstanding his little rest and his simple vegetarian diet, he is enabled to work all the time when he is awake, week in and week out, as he observes no rest-day. His only relief from incesssant toil is an hour's rest in the middle of the day during the hot season. THE gourmand "lives to eat," with no regard for anything but quantity ; the gourmet " eats to live," with a chief regard for the quality of the viand, and the excellence of its preparation for the table. ŠN. Y. Tribune. THE DARKENED Room.Š Dr. B. W. Richardson says that the first words of most physicians when they enter sick rooms in private houses should be Goethe's dying exclamation : " More light ! more light ! " It certainly is true that generally, before the doctor can get a good look at the patient, he has to ask that the curtains be raised, in order that the rays of a much greater healer than the ablest physi-cian may ever hope to be, may be admitted. If the patient's eyes are so affected that they cannot bear the light, a little ingenuity will suffice to screen them, and at the same time allow the cheerful light to enter. A dark sick room must be an uncheerful one, and now that it is known that light is one of the most potent microbe-killers, let us have it in abundance. Why should people behave as if they were quite sure the patient were about to die ? In the matter of abundant light, hospital wards are more salubrious than most private sick rooms, for light not only slays bacteria, but cheers the mind. To account for " the darkened room " that is such an ordinary accompaniment of illness that it may be said to be firmly built into English literature, we must go back hundreds of years, when a patient who was sick, say on a " four-poster " bedstead, was tightly inclosed with red curtainsŠthat color, through some unac-countable superstition, being thought to have an occult potency over disease. Old superstitions die hard, and it will yet require years of education, and the united efforts of doctor and nurse, to let in God's first-created gift to man to the rooms that it will warm and brighten and purify as nothing else can.ŠNew York Independent.
