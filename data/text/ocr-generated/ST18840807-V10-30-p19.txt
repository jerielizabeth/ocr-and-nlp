ŁŁŁŁ-Ł.- IT is now sixteen years since the Seventh-day Adventists adopted the plan of holding camp-meetings and during this time the interest in them has steadily increased until the present summer will witness larger and more interesting ones than ever before. Commencing in the early spring these an-nual gatherings are held in each of the Eastern, Western, Middle and Southern States as far as Alabama and Texas, including several on the Pacific Coast Not less than thirty of these State meetings will be held this year and as in former years wll be marked with the most perfect or-der and quietness. Over one hundred thousand people attend these meetings during the season many of whom, for the first time, become ac-quainted with the views of this denomination. Ł IT is less than forty years since the Seventh-day Adventists were first organized as a denom-ination, yet their members have rapidly increased until at the present time they have about thirty thousand believers in this country. They have also well established missions in England, Nor-way, Switzerland, Prussia, Italy, and Roumania, and by means of these their missionary opera-tions are extended throughout Europe and into Asia and Africa. Believers to this faith may be found in the islands of the Mediterranian as well as those of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. San. missions have been established in San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, New York City, Buffalo, Boston, New Bedford, and Providence, in America; and Liverpool and Hull in England. Nearly every vessel that leaves these ports is vis-ited and religious reading matter distributed among the sailors and passengers. Many of these vessels carry papers and tracts to distrib-ute at the foreign ports to which they are bound. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES.-SUPPLEMENT. 3 You may be pleased with the preaching, you may become animated and revived, but the convert-ing, reforming power of God will not be felt in the heart, and the work will not be so deep, thor- ' ough, and lasting as it should be. Let pride be PROPHECY meets its fulfillment in the natural course of events, and in a quiet manner, so that few at the time recognize its fulfillment Moses in prophesying of Christ said " A pro- Our educational interests also have received an impetus that is very marked. Three large institutions of learning have been established at a cost of not less than $150,000, while smaller denominational schools are springing up like plants out of the earth. There is an increasing desire with many of our churches to secure the most exemplary and God-fearing teachers to teach their children,Šthose who know how to teach the Bible successfully. Our people are beginning to realize that time is fast closing and that if they would be prepared for the coming storm they must put forth greater efforts than in the past. The time has come when advance moves are being made in every part of the field. Blind unbelief is sure to err, And scan his work in vain; God is his own interpreter And he will make it plain. The progress of the third angel's message dur-ing the last twelve months has been remarkable indeed. It would seem that an infinite power has been moving the people of God and leading them to take steps that would appear utterly im-possible. Four new periodicals in the interest of pres-ent truth have been issued within the last seven months in Europe in as many different languages; three of these, one each in the Roumanian, Ital-ian and German, are published in Bale, Switz-erland, and one in English in Great Grimsby, England. These papers have a large circulation in Europe and each is to a large extent sustained by subscriptions.. God is raising up friends to the truth in these countries to fill positions of trust Missions have been established in many of the largest cities in this country, and a large number of persons have entered the field as colporters and canvassers and are holding. Bible-readings, etc.; not a few of these are becoming successful workers. Truly God is going before us and pre-paring hearts to receive the unpopular truths weŁ profess. And it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people." This The Jews fully believed, but the manner of Christ's coming, the humility of his birth, and the thirty years of his life spent with his father as a carpenter, so blinded their eyes that notwithstanding he ful-filled the prophecy in every particular they did not see it. As he taught in their synagogues many hearing him were astonished and said "From whence bath this man these things; and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? Is*not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and of Juda and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him." When God predicts an event to take place he does not always give the particular circumstances that are to bring it about or accompany its ful-fillment God has predicted concerning the clos-ing work of the gospel that it shall go to " every nation and kindred and tongue and people," and when " This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, then shall the end come." And this prophecy will be fulfilled in our midst while as it has been with other prophecies in the past, but few will understand it THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY. IN no denomination does the sabbath-school work receive greater attention than among this people. It is not considered as a means to ed-ucate the youth and children only, in the Scrip-tures, but, all, young and old take part in it Not content with merely reading the text, they urge a careful study of the same, till the student thor-oughly understands the subject The General Sabbath-school Association pub-lishes a weekly paper, The Youths Instructor, de-voted principally to the Sabbath-school work. The various state organizations are branches of this association. A model Sabbath-school will be held on the camp-ground each sabbath of the meeting, at 9.00, A. M. in which the entire encampment will participate. The Sunday agitation, having in view an amendment to the Constitution, is another token of the near approach of the time of trouble. We have been expecting the fulfillment of the prophecies relating to this event for the past thirty years, and we now see it before our eyes. Our camp-meetings are increasing in impor-tance. They are far more extensively advertised this year, thus securing a larger attendance than ever before. Three of these meetings will be held in New England the present season in the following places. Worcester, Mass., Burlington, Vermont, and Portland, Maine. These meetings will be the most important and will doubtless be the largest of any ever held in the New England States. S. N. HASKELL. Ł crucified, and the soul be clad with the priceless robe of Christ's righteousness, and what a meet-ing will you enjoy. The same work of humiliation and heart-search- phet shall.the Lord your God raise up unto you ing should also go on in the church, so that all of your brethren like unto me; him shall ye hear Ł differences and alienations among brethren may in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. be  laid aside before appearing before the Lord at these annual gatherings. Go about this work in earnest, and rest not until it is accomplished; for if you come up to the meeting with your doubts, your murmurings, your disputings, you bring evil angels into the camp, and carry dark-ness wherever you go. For want of this preparation these yearly meet-ings have accomplished but little. The minis-ters are seldom prepared to labor for God. There are many speakers,Šthose who can say sharp, cram things, going out of their way to whip other churches and ridicule their faith,Šbut there are but few earnest laborers for God. These sharp self-important speakers profess to have truth in advance of every other people, but their manner of labor and their religious zeal in no way corresponds with their profession of faith. These yearly gatherings might be, and they should be, meetings of earnest labor. Ministers should seek a heart preparation before entering upon the work of helping others, for the people are far in advance of many of the ministers. The should untiringly wrestle in prayer until the Lord blesses them. When the love of God is burning on the altar of their hearts, they will not preach to exhibit their own smartness, but to present Christ who taketh away the sins of the world. In the early church, Christianity was taught in its purity; its precepts were given by the voice of inspiration; its ordinances were uncor-rupted by the device of men. The church re-vealed the spirit of Christ, and appeared beauti-ful in its simplicity. Its adorning was the holy principles and exemplary lives of its members. Multitudes were won to Christ, not by display or learning, but by the power of God which at,-tended the plain preaching of his word. But the church has become corrupt And now there is greater necessity than ever that ministers should be channels of light There are many flippant talkers of Bible truth, whose souls are as barren of the spirit of God as were the hills of Gilboa of dew and rain. But what we need is men who are thoroughly con-verted themselves, and can teach others how to give their hearts to God. The power of godli-ness has almost ceased to be in our churches. And why is this ? The Lord is still waiting to be gracious; he has not closed the windows of heaven. We have separated ourselves from him. We need to fix the eye of faith upon the cross, and believe that Jesus is our strength, our salva-tion. As we see so little burden of the work resting upon ministers and people, we inquire, When the Lord comes, shall he find faith on the earth ? It is faith that is lacking. God has an abun-dance of grace and power awaiting our demand. But the reason we do not feel our great need of it is because we look to ourselves and not to Je-sus. We do not exalt Jesus and rely wholly upon his merits. Would that I could impress upon ministers and people the necessity of a deeper work of grace in the heart, and more thorough prepara-tion to enter into the spirit and labor of our camp-meetings, that they may receive the great-est possible benefits from these meetings. These yearly gatherings may be seasons of special blessing, or they may be a great injury to spirit-uality. Which shall they be to you, dear reader? It remains for each to decide for himself.
