Comfortables and quilts are unsatisfactory sick-room bedding, as they are not easily cleansed, and absorb infectious matter. This is an ideal of a sick room which many will feel beyond their reach ; yet even in a home where every room is in daily use, much may be done by a little wise forethought. Select for the sick room the one which can be most easily isolated from the others, and has an open stove or grate. The room may be shut off from others by pasting up communicating doors and using the outside door, which should open directly outside or into a hall which :loes not con-nect with other rooms of the house. Old sheets and blankets should be mended and kept on hand, also a clean bedtick, unfilled, and ready for the fresh straw usually so plenty in the country. A clean, thin cot-ton mattress to lay over the strawtick will make a very sanitary sick bed. The best bedstead for the room is a plain iron bed-frame, which may be bought for three or four dollars. It is well to have a good painted floor in a room intended at any time to be  used as a sick room ; then in case of need the carpet may easily be exchanged for a few rugs. Never keep clothing, trunks, or other belongings of the patient or any one else in the sick room, or in any closet communicating with it. Clothing absorbs disease germs very readily, and retains them a long time un-less sterilized by heat, which process very often injures clothing, besides causing much labor. I know many will feel these preparations suggested for possible sickness will involve a great deal of trouble, time for which is not easily spared in a busy family life. But think how much work is done in a family of even moderate circumstances in getting ready for a birthday party or a Thanksgiving feast which is not especially conducive to any one's wel-fare. The old saw, " Where there's a will there's a way," is as true as ever; and custom has much to do with the seeming possibility of any task. So the practice of shutting the well from the sick, thus pro-tecting the well from infection and the sick from noise, odors, and other annoyances, must become habitual by repetitio11 before it shall be a common custom for people to prepare while in health for future illnesses. O THE GERMS OF DISEASE WHICH TRAVEL UPWARD. DISEASE germs are often given a free passage from under the floor, basement, or cellar, by a current of cold air which rushes in to fill the vacuum made by heating the air in the rooms above. This is espe-cially true in cold weather, when doors and windows are closed and listed, and steam registers, steam coils, and base burners are heated to their utmost to create a summer temperature in the home. Sewers, gas pipes, decaying food, mold from damp cellars, and decaying wood, are all giving off gases, and per-chance the home itself is built upon made land, over a marsh which has for many years in the past been the dumping-ground for city refuse. The family, sitting contentedly around the gas jets or the electric lights in the evening, are unable to see, even by their brill-iant flame, the tiny denisons which are floating up-ward from every open seam and through the doors of the basement. Foul ground air is often the principal source of winter ventilation in the houses of those who are fairly well-to-do, and have all of life's necessities and most of its luxuries. The winter is the time when many disease germs flourish, and swell the reports of mortality from smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, bronchitis, and  pneumonia, to say nothing of lesser catarrhal res-piratory ailments, which, becoming chronic, are fastened on the patient for life. Under all our large cities there are systems of tubes, sewer pipes, water pipes and gas pipes, which are liable to become leaky at any time, and only the water pipe proclaims itself faulty by visibly flooding the premises. All the others send out their deluge of microbe-filled gases, and give no sign until dis-ease is fastened on some member of the family, and the physician's services, as well as those of the plumber, are required. The stationary washbowl, with its drainpipe out of order, or a defective trap, may be flooding the bedroom with the foul sewer air of the city main pipe, whence, with all kinds of organic mat-ter poured daily into it from its various tributa-ries, come all forms of disease germs. The pipe from the private cesspool in the back yard of the subur-ban resident may be doing just as deadly work. If the foul contents of this vile receptacle were flowing into the house in visible streams, we would take means to shut them off; but because they are invisi-ble, they are only the more potent for evil.
