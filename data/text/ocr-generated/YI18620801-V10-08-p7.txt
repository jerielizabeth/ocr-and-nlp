(45  HERE is a significant meaning to all the names in Scripture, but none are more re-markably so than some of the names of the Deity. The word LORD is a contraction of the Anglo Saxon Elaford, often written  Loverd,  and lastly Lord. It comes from hlaf, bread, hence our word loaf, and ford, to supply, to give out. The word therefore implies, " the giver of bread." The name GOD, also, comes from the old Saxon word god, good, which was then spelt with one vow-el less. It was a synonym for all goodness. Thus now when we pray, 0 Lord, and 0 God, it is the same as saying, "0 Giver of bread," and "Thou who art Supremely Good." a. w. A. For the Youth's Instructor. A Letter. OIING FRIENDS: I want to say a few words to you through the Instructor. I have long thought I would say something in behalf of our little paper, but have never taken up my pen until now. I have known it ever since I was a very small child, and it has always been a welcome visitor to my home. I have many times been tired of play, playthings, flowers, and such-like, but not so with this little paper. On the holy Sabbath my dear mother would gather her children around her, and read to us from it about other little Sabbath-keepers, how they wanted to be good, and be prepared for Christ's coming. The tears would start to our eyes, and especially to mine, for I knew how naughty I was at times, and then I would make resolutions to do better. Although I am a child no more, I still love it. I hail its monthly visits with joy. I still love to read those sweet communications from the young SO-bath-keepers. How much you should love this lit-tle sheet, so full of good instruction for the children of these last days. How much you ought to love your kind heavenly Father who has caused your parents to keep his holy rest-day, and to teach you to keep it also. How thankful you should be that he has given you such kind parents and friends, while other little children are growing up in wick-edness and sin, and have no one to teach the right way, nor any little paper so full of good instruction and truth. I have no doubt you feel very sorry for such chil-dren; then if you do, do you not think that there  RO. AMADON : I send you twenty-five cents to pay for Elizabeth P.'s Instructor, of Tompkins, this State. Sister P. called here recently and left fifteen cents, which she wished me to send to you, and say she would send the rest as soon as she could get it. Sister P. said her daughter felt very much afraid of losing the In-structor, from what was written in the Review con-cerning it. She told her child she might gather all the paper-rags she could find to sell, and get the money in that way to pay for her little paper. Hel-len immmediately set about collecting the rags, and rent them to Jackson to sell,Å when sold, they brought fifteen cents. She intends to continue in this way till the rest is paid. Helen I think must love the instruction in her paper, or she would not feel such an interest to continue it. I was led to contrast her situation with many little Sabbath keepers who receive the same paper with-out any thought or care in regard to paying for it. It comes very regular to them, and they love to read it, but scarcely, if ever, think how much care it causes many ; but receive it as any common bles-sing for which they have no care or anxiety. I was glad to see M. (my little girl) willing to make up the deficiency from her earnings out of school hours. May she and all other little Sabbath keep-ers ever remember, It is more blessed to give than to receive." A. E. GURNEY. Jackson, Mich. "Pull, Adam, Pull!" gHERE was a lad in Ireland who was put to work at a linen-factory, and while he was at work there, a piece of cloth was wanted to be sent out which was short of the quantity that it ought to have ; but the master thought it might be made the length by a little stretching. He there-upon unrolled the cloth, taking hold of one end of it himself, and placing the boy at the other. He then said, " Pull, Adam, Pull !" The master pulled with all his might, but the boy -stood still. The master again said, " Pull, Adam, Pull !" The boy said, " I can't." " Why not ?" said the master. " Because it is wrong," said Adam, and he refused to pull. Upon this the master said he would not do for a linen-manufacturer ; but that boy became the Rev. Dr. Adam Clarke, and the strict principles of honesty of his youthful age laid the foundation of his, future greatness.
