256 GOOD PIMATirrPl. ublish,er's Cage. far The patients at the Sanitarium are rejoicing in the use of the new gymnasium, of which they have recently taken possession. It is a magnificent room, 85 feet in length, 45 feet in width, and 16 feet high in the center. Eighteen large windows, and a cupola with ten windows, afford an ample supply of light and air. The walls of the new building have been fin-ished, and the root is being put on.' The prome-nade deck is eighty-four feet above the ground, and affords a magnificent' view of as pleasant scenery as can be found anywhere in the Middle States. far A Normal of Hygiene and Heredity will be held this season in connection with the temperance convocation at Lake Bluff. The time set for the Normal is August 15 to 20. Among the speakers who have been engaged are: Dr. Sarah Hackett Ste-venson, of Chicago, who will discourse on the sub-ject of Causes of Ill-Health among Women; Dr. T. D. Crothers, editor of the Journal of Inebriety, who will deliver two addresses upon the Hereditary Ef-fects of Alcohol; and Dr. Florence Hunt, who will speak upon the Development of the Human Body. The Editor of this journal will give two lectures, one on the subject of Foods, the other on Household Hygiene. Mrs. E. E. Kellogg, Supt. of the Depart-ment of Hygiene, will read an address on Hygiene versus Intemperance. These temperance convocations have been grow-ing in interest each year, and it is believed that the one held the present season will excel its predeces-sors in practical results. egr At the beginning of the next school year, which opens the first week in September next, a Manual Labor Training department will be introduced as a part of the regular course of instruction in the Battle Creek College of this place. Several trades, including printing, book-binding, dress-mak-ing, and millinery will be taught. In addition, young ladies will receive thorough training in all departments of housekeeping, and young men will be practically instructed in gardening and farming. The introduction of this department has been con-templated by the Trustees for several years, and ar-rangements are now being perfected to carry it on in a manner, which, it is believed, will be thoroughly satisfactory and in every way successful. It is expected, also, that a department for physi-cal culture will be added, in which will be undertaken a careful supervision of the health of students. The establishment of the dormitory system, which will be rendered possible by the erection of a new building now in progress for this purpose, renders possible the supervision of the dietary and other healthful conditions in a manner not heretofore practicable. It is believed by the managers of the school that a very perceptible improvement in the general health and physique of the students may be made by care-ful attention to healthful conditions. The period of growth and development affords the best of opportunities for favorably influencing the con-stitution; and when such an experiment as the one proposed has been made in a rational way, the re-sults have been in the highest degree satisfactory. We believe that the addition of the two departments named, will receive the-hearty approval of all friends  of the school, and will add greatly to its usefulness. During the last year, some five hundred students were in attendance, and there is every prospect that there will be a very large increase of patronage during the coming school year. There is no school in the coun-try where the student can receive a more practical and thorough educational training, and where he will be surrounded by better moral and social influ-ences than at Battle Creek. The annual catalogue will be in readiness in a few days, and may be ob-tained by addressing Battle Creek College, Battle Creek, Mich. agr The publishers would call especial attention to our advertising columns, in which will be found noticed many articles of practical interest to almost every one. Among the books and other articles re-ceiving special notice in the present number, are the following:Å  " The Home Hand-Book of Domestic Hygiene and Rational Medicine" is a work which ought to be in every family in the United States. "Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease" has re-ceived a warm reception from sensible women wher-ever it has been introduced; and although published recently, it has already reached a very large sale. "Plain Facts for Old and Young," a practical work dealing with most important subjects, has passed through fifteen large editions, aggregating over 75,000 copies. "Sunshine at Home" is a very attractive work for children, and is meeting with a very large sale. " United States in the Light of Prophecy " and "Matter and Spirit" are two very interesting and important works on theological subjects. "Smith's Diagram of Parliamentary Rules" is highly recommended by a speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives, and is indorsed by eminent par-liamentarians as the best work ever produced. Dr. Kellogg's New Temperance Charts, consisting of ten large plates, are recognized as superior to any-thing which has been produced in that line hereto-fore. The Dietetic Reformer is the best exponent of veg-etarianism published. We would also call attention to the list of popular health works, including books and tracts on a va-riety of topics of interest to everybody; and the list of popular journals which club with Goon HEALTH may well be looked over before selecting periodicals for the household. Under the head of " Invalid Foods" may be found a large list of most valuable food articles for persons who are in feeble health, particularly dyspeptics. The various articles presented are wholesome in the highest degree for persons who are in good health, as well as for those who are sick; and are so palatable that a fair trial is all that is required to secure continued use. The Hygienic Skirt and Hose Supporters are ar-ticles which no lady can afford to be without. They contribute more to the correction of serious faults in woman's dress than any other inventions which have been made in this line. The Syphon Syringe is recognized as the best syr-inge made, and is an article which is indispensable for every household. The advertisement of the Anglo-Swiss Milk Food and the Columbus Buggy Company are worthy the attention of those who need anything in that line. The Eureka Incubator is a marvel of simplicity, and is in every way satisfactory as a chicken hatcher. Two are in use on the Sanitarium farm.
