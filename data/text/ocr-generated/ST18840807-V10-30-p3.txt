AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 467 Many Called, Few Chosen. GOD hasŁ taken special care to make himself known to mankind in different ages of the world; bat our fallen race have not desired " to retain God in their knowledge," and therefore the mass have been given over to a reprobate mind. The antediluvians might have had the knowledge of God, but they chose the way of corruption, violence, and sin, and therefore God gave them, and all future generations, the proof' of his existence, his power and justice, and of the hatefulness of sin and certainty of retribu-tion. Again we find the world given to idolatry, and Abraham and his posterity were singled out, not because of God's partiality to them as a whole (for most of them proved unbelieving and rebellious), but to keep alive the knowledge of God in the earth; so that all, Jews or Gen-tiles, might choose the service of God and eter-nal life, if they would. And when fbr their sins Jerusalem was de-stroyed and the people carried captive into Babylon, the Lord made it a special occasion to make himself known in all the earth. By be-ing brought in contact with Daniel and his com-panions, Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was hum-bled, so that he proclaimed the name and won-ders of the Most High, the "King of Heaven," to "all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth" (Dan. 3 and 4); and after this Darius the Median made a decree that in "every dominion" men should " tremble and fear before the God of Daniel," declaring to all na-tions that "he is the living God," who "worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth." Dan. 6. It is reasonable to suppose that some were benefited and prepared for salvation by these means; but still the mass of men were willing to ignore God and cleave to their sins and fol-lies, and go on in the broad road to perdition. Many were called, but few chosen. At length the promised Messiah came, of whom the devout among mankind wore in expec-tation, Gentiles as well as Jews; for the Script-ures containing the promises and appointing the time, had, by God's providence, been trans-lated into the Greek; and by this means the "wise men from the East" were on the lookout, " being in expectation," as well as devout Jews, " waiting for the consolation of Israel." And then the mighty miracles of Christ and his tragic death, in which Roman governors as well as Jews took a part, were soon made known in all the earth. Thus the proclamation went to the multitudes far and near, calling them to re-pent and believe the glad tidings. Many were called, and, thank God, a few of them were chosen. But soon those nations which had en-joyed the light of the gospel relapsed into dark-ness and idolatry, while others more remote were illuminated with its rising rays. The whole world might now have been in the light, if the light had been cherished; but the carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not willing to retain the knowledge of his ways and re-quirements. And now in the closing of the gospel age the light of God, through his word and providence, is illuminating the world as never before. Prophecies fulfilled and fulfilling clearly point to the present time as the day of God's prepara-tion. Messages from Heaven, clearly foretold eighteen hundred years ago, are now being proclaimed to" many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings." Many are being called; but, as it has been before, many will reject the glad tidings, while the few faithful and obedi-ent, will receive, hold fast, and endure, and thus be saved. And not 411 who professedly accept the last message of the gospel will be saved. Hun-dreds. if not thousands, of these will fail to walk in the light; and for this reason will not endure the fiery trials that lie before us. Even  now they shrink from bearing the oross befOre an evil and rebellious generation, yielding to fashionable folly, rather than to stand boldly for the truth and the right. Many who have for years been connected with the people of God under this message will only be like the chaffŠa needful support to the grain while it is ripen-ing, and of no further use. Can it be so? 0 my soul! Yes, dreadful as the thought may be! But you and I, pry brother, my sister, may be saved, if we will. We may be reckoned with the chosen few. God only asks for entire consecration of all that we have and are to serve the interests of his cause. This we can give. We can now give a whole sacrifice of ourselves and all we possess, live out the faith that we profess, and lay hold on eternal life. Will we do it? While in the providence of God the world is being aroused by the last call of mercy, will we sacrifice all to have a part in the work? Remember that to the saved it will be said, "Well done!" not well said, well be-lieved. nor even well prayed; for "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven." See Matt. 7 : 21-23. Many, the Lord Jesus as-sures us, will hear the word, Depart! But still it is our privilege so to believe and do that we may hear instead, Come, ye blessed of my Fa-ther. May God bless these thoughts to the sal- vation of-some! R. F. COTTRELL. A Mark of the New Birth. A SCRIPTURAL mark of those who are born of God, and the greatest of all, is love, even the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto them. Rom. 5 : 5. Because they are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts. crying, Abbu, Father! Gal. 4: 6. By this Spirit, continually looking up to God as their reconciled and loving Father, they cry to him for their daily bread, for all things needful, whether for their souls or bodies. They con-tinually pour out their hearts before him, know-ing they have the petitions which they ask of him. 1 John 5 : 15. Their delight is in him. He is the joy of their heart; their "shield," and their "exceeding great reward." The de-sire of their soul is towards him; it is their "meat and drink to do his will;" and they are satisfied as with marrow and fatness, while their mouth praiseth him with joyful lips. Ps. 63 : 5. And, in this sense also, "Every one that lov-eth him that begat loveth him also that is be-gotten of him." 1 John 5 : 1. His spirit rejoic-eth in God his Saviour. He "loveth the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity." He is so "joined unto the Lord," as to be one spirit. His soul hangeth upon him, and cbooseth him as alto-gether lovely, "the chiefest among ten thou-sand." He knoweth, he feeleth what that means, "My Beloved is mine, and I am his." "Thou art fairer than the children of men; full of grace are thy lips, because God hath anointed thee forever!" Ps. 45 : 2. The necessary fruit of this love of God, is the love of our neighbor; of every soul which God hath made, not excepting our enemies, not excepting those who are now despitefully using and persecuting usŠa love whereby we love every man as ourselves, as we love our own souls. Nay, our Lord has expressed it still more strongly, teaching us to "love one another, even as he hath loved us." Accord-ingly, the commandment written in the hearts of all those that love God, is no other than this, "As I have loved you, so love ye one another." Now, "herein perceive we the love of God, in that he laid down his life for us." 1 John 3 : 16. " We ought," then, as the apostle justly infers, "to lay down our lives for the brethren." If we feel ourselves ready to do this, then do we  truly love our neighbor. Then "we know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren." Verse 14. Hereby know we " that we are born of God, that we "dwell in him, and he in us, .because be bath given us of his [loving] Spirit." Chap. 4 : 13. For "love is of God; and every one that lov-eth is born of God, and knoweth God." 1 John 4 : 7. But some may possibly ask, Does not the apostle say, "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments?" 1 John 5: 3. Yea, and this is the love of our neighbor also, in the same sense as it is the love of God. But what would you infer from hence? That the keep-ing the outward commandments is all that is implied in loving God with all your heart, with all your mind, and soul, and strength, and in loving your neighbor as yourself? That the love of God is not an affection of the soul, but merely an outward service? And that the love of our neighbor is not a disposition of heart, but barely a course of outward works? To mention so wild an interpretation of the apos-tle's words, is sufficiently to confute it. Th plain, indisputable meaning of that text is, this is the sign or proof of the love of God, of our keeping the first and great commandment, to keep all the rest of his commandments. For true love, if it be once shed abroad in our heart, will constrain us so to do; since whosoever loves God with all his heart, cannot but serve him with all his strength. A second fruit then of the love of God (so far as it can be distinguished from it), is uni-versal obedience to him we love, and conform-ity to his will; obedienee to all the commands of God, internal and external; obedience of the heart and of the life; in every temper, and in all manner of conversation. And one of the tempers most obviously implied herein is, the being "zealous of good works;" the hungering and thirsting to do good, in every possible kind, unto all men; the rejoicing to "spend and be spent for them," for every child of man; not looking for any recompense in this world, but only in the resurrection of the just.Š Wesley. Teaching Transgressors. THERE is no one who cannot read with profit the following paragraph from some comments by H. Clay Trumbull on the fifty-first psalm:Š " Then will I teach transgressors thy ways" (verse 13). No man can teach what he doesn't know. No man can load where he doesn't go. No man really understands the value of that which he never had. It is he who knows the joy of forgiveness, who can teach its blessedness to the lost. It is he who walks in God's way, who can lead another there. It is he who has salvation, who appreciates its preciousness. If you want to teach, you must first be taught. If you want to lead in the way of life, you must walk therein yourself'. If you would have others know how good it is to trust the Lord, you must know it yourself, to begin with. This putting of those who are not Christians to be teachers of those who are just like themselves, is at the best but setting the blind to lead the blind. Both parties are more likely to land in the ditch, than to find their way out of a wrong road into a right one. This trying to get trans-gressors to forsake their ways for God's way, while you are walking on before them to de-struction, is as hopeless as it is foolish. Your example in a course which you do understand is a great deal more powerful than your words about a subject of which you are ignorant. Put your own trust in Jesus as a Saviour; rest on him for salvation; find joy in his service; then you may teach transgressors his ways, and be the means of converting sinners unto him. LET your light so shine before men that they may glorify God on account of it.
