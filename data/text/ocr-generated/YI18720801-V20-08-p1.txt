IN a paper called the Illustrated Christian Weekly, is an interesting article with this ti-tle. From it is borrowed most of the follow-ing paragraphs for the readers of the IN-STRUCTOR. Everything which God has made shows his wisdom and goodness, and thus all things praise him. There are several ways in which the trees give us pleasure, and so praise their Maker. One thing which gives us pleasure is their shape. How majestic this is. There is the great trunk rising out of the ground, and gradually tapering, or getting smaller, as it rises higher. Then it throws out its long branches like the arms of a giant. Over these the leaves are spread like a beau-tiful, rich dress. Different kinds of trees have shapes -that differ much from each other, and yet they all are beautiful. The color is another thing about trees that is very pleasing. When they first put out their fresh, green leaves in the spring, how pleasant it is to look at them. And all through the summer, though the color of the trees grows darker, how pleasant it is to look upon the robe of green which the trees of the field and of the forest are wearing. How desolate and dreary the hills and mount-ains would look, if the tall trees that grow upon them were all swept away. And then when autumn comes, and the early frosts just touch the trees, and their green color changes into red and brown, and scarlet and purple, and gold, and we see the woods and forests glowing and glittering with all the colors of the rainbow, how glorious-it is, and what pleasure the trees give us then 1 Another thing about the trees which gives us pleasure is their size. We like to look at big things, and especially big trees. And the size to which some trees grow is really wonderful. At a place called Alonville, in he uth's structor. VOLUME 20. BATTLE CREEK, MICH., AUGUST, 1872. NUMBER 8. " Hear Counsel, and receive Instruction, that thou mayest be Wise." Prey. 19:20. Normandy, there is an oak which is more than thirty-five feet round the trunk. It is very old, and the inside is decayed. This has been h011owed out, and a chapel has been made in the trunk. It is nicely ceiled, and has a flight of steps leading up to it. In South America, the locust tree grows to a very great size. A gentleman who had been there saw one so large that it took fif-teen Indians to reach found it, the tips of their fingers just touching. But the greatest and tallest trees in the world are in California. There is a small forest of these trees on the side of a mount-ain. Some of them, when they have fallen down, and been ollowed out, are large enough for three men on horseback to ride abreast through. One of these trees is four hundred and fifty feet higif. This is more than twice as high as any church steeple in Philadelphia. If this tree were hollowed out, the trunk would make a room large enough to hold a Sabbath-school of two hun-dred children, with their teachers. One of these trees is called, " The mother of the forest." It rises straight up to the Night of a hundred and forty feet before a single branch appears. Then it goes up, and up, and up, till it reaches to three hundred and sixty-three feet. That is twenty-three feet higher than the top of St. Paul's Cathedral, London. Then the age-of some trees is a thing about them which gives us pleasure, and so praises their Creator. We like to look at old things. If we have an aged friend who is getting on toward ninety or a hundred years, how we like to look at his bending form and silvery locks as he walks slowly by. But some trees reach to a greater age than even Methuselah reached, who was nearly a thousand years old when he died. It is easy to tell the age of a tree, for the wood forms rings that grow outside of each other. One of these rings is formed each year, so that when the tree is cut down, you can quite correctly tell its age. Let our young readers who live near forests remem-ber this. It is an interesting pastime to as-certain the age of a tree, or see how far it dates back. The oldest oak tree in England is called "The Parliament Oak," because King Ed-ward the first is said to have held a Parlia-ment under its branches. It is just six.hun-dred years since Edward the first began to reign. This "Parliament Oak" is supposed to be about fifteen hundred years old. It belongs to the Duke of Portland. The big tree of California, already spoken of; is supposed to be three thousand years old!  Then it must have begun to grow some time before the prophet Samuel was born. Among the cedars of Lebanon is one large tree which naturalists suppose is four thou-sand years old ! Then it must have begun to grow soon after Noah left the ark, and was a large tree when our Saviour was on earth. Perhaps he often sat under its shade, as it is thought he did under the large trees which now stand in the Garden of Gethsemane. Could these trees speak, what a wonderful story they might tell ! The oldest tree in the world is said to be in one of the Cape de Verde Islands. It be-longs to what is called the Baobab, or Mon-key-bread tree. This tree is calculated by  the French traveler, Adamson, to be over five thousand years old! If this is true, it must have begun to grow while Adam was still living. How many wonderful ways there are, in which even the trees praise God. It is the privilege of us all to learn useful lessons from the world and nature around us. G. W. AMADON. Repentance. A COUNTRYMAN had with his own hands cultivated a row of valuable fruit tree's. To his great delight they were bearing the first fruit, and he was anxious to see of what kind this fruit would be. Then the son of his neighbor, a bad boy, came into the garden and enticed the coun-tryman's son to go out with him and rob all the trees of their fruit before it was quite ripe. Ł When the owner of the garden came up and saw the naked trees, he was very sorry, and cried, " Oh! why have they done this to me ? Some bad boys have spoiled all my pleas-ure." These words smote the heart of the coun-tryman's son, and he ran to the neighbor's son, and said : "Alas, my father is grieved about the deed that we have done. Now I have no more peace in my heart; my father will not love me any more, but will punish me with contempt, as I deserve." Then the other boy, who was a very wicked boy, answered, "You foolish boy! your father knows nothing about it, and will never know any-thing. You must carefully conceal it from him, and be upon your guard." But when GodfreyŠfor that was the boy's nameŠcarne home and saw the friendly countenance of his father, 'he dared not to look at him with friendly glances in return ; for he thought, " How can I look cheer-fully at him whom I have grieved ?ŠI can-not bear to look at myself. My sin lies like a dark shadow on my heart." And now his father came up, and gave each of the children some autumn fruit, and he gave some to Godfrey too. Then the other children came bounding up, and they were very glad, and ate the fruit ; but God- frey hid his face and wept bitterly. , Then his father turned to himiand said : " My son, why do you weep ?" " Ohl" replied Godfrey, " I am not wor-thy to be called your son ! I can no longer bear to appear in your eyes and in the eyes of others different from what I am. Dear father, do not be kind to me any more ; but punish me, that I may come to you again, and cease to be my own tormentor. Let me suffer severely for my wrong do-ing, for it was I who robbed the little trees." Then his father gave him his hand, and pressed him to his heart, and said : " I forgive you, my child ; and may Gcd grant that this be the first and the last time Ł
