520 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 8[VoL.01,No. 33. Zkv ill aim awl " Sanctify them through Thy Truth ; Thy Word is Truth." BATTLE GREEN, Mien., AUGUST 12, 1884. URIAFI SMITH,  Emon. Ł CORRESPONDING EDITORS. RESURRECTION OF THE WICKED, AGAIN. (Concluded.) THE Herald mistakes our position, and the sub-ject itself, we think, in the cases of the Egyptians, Sodomites, etc. It quotes texts to show that their overthrow was on account of their sins, and seems to consider these conclusive proof that such over-throw was therefore the final settlement of their account with God. Now we have never denied that they were destroyed on account of their sins ; but what was visited upon them for their sins ? As we explained in our first article, their death was simply anticipated by a few years. They would have died just the same after a little while. This the Herald admits, but says it was, not be-cause Adam had sinned, but because they had sinned. But as we said in the beginning, would it not have been just the same if they had been para-gons of virtue ? Certainly it would, as every one well knows. Does not the innocent, sinless babe fall in death ? Then do not tell any reasonable man that all the account God takes of the out-breaking and intolerable sins that some men com-mit, is simply to cause them to die a little sooner than they would otherwise have done. No ; they have an account yet to settle at the bar of God ; and Christ recognizes this fact when he points out a future day of Judgment for Sodom and Gomorrah, and says that it shall then be more tolerable for those cities than for some later sinners who have rejected greater light. Matt. 10 : 15. The doctrine of the non-resurrection of the wicked outrages every principle of justice, as well as the plain statements of the Scriptures. The Bible assures us over and over again, that every man shall be rewarded according as his work shall be ; that he shall 'receive the things done in his body whether good or bad; that some shall be beaten with few stripes, some with many. Luke 12 : 47, 48 ; Rom. 2 : 6 ; 2 Cor. 5 : 10, etc. etc. There are degrees, and very differing degrees, of guilt and goodness. Some are deserv-ing of far greater punishment than others and some of greater reward than others, and the pun-ishment and re ward shall, if the Scriptures tell us the truth, be accurately adjusted to the desert in every case. But according to the doctrine we are reviewing, the most guilty receive sometimes apparently far less, certainly no greater, punish-ment than those who are less guilty. Take for instance, the man, who, as the world estimates character, lives a quiet, respectable life. He does no one any injury. But yet he is an impenitent man, he rejects the offer of life through Christ, aid goes down in death without hope. . According to the Herald, he will remain dead for-ever. But here is another man who is a monster of iniquity ; he gloats over ruined virtue ; he robs the widow and fatherless ; he revels in dishonest gain ; he even puts the saints of God to death with fiendish tortures. There have been many such, the Neros, the Borgias, the Alvas, the Bloody Marys ; and some of these have died exulting and glorying in their crimes. And now the Herald says, these having died, will simply remain dead forever ; no difference between these and the case first noted ; no taking into account these terrible crimes and awarding to them any more punish-ment than the others. EVery man's inborn sense of justice cries out against such partiality, against such ignoring of crime ; and God's word itself cries out against it. Don't ask any reasonable man to believe that God, after all his threatenings against the personal sins of reprobates, will thus ignore them. No ; they shall answer for their deeds ; they shall die for their own personal sins, and understand it so ; and in going down again into death, shall experience that measure of tribu-lation and anguish, God's indignation and wrath, that is adjusted to the magnitude of their guilt. Says God by Ezekiel; "When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and commit-teth iniquity, and dieth in them ; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die," or he shall die. Here are certainly two deaths, one in his sins, and the other afterward, for his sins. Eze. 18 : 26. And verses 27 and 28 continue : "Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Be-cause he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he bath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die." This must refer to the second death ; for just such persons do die the first death. How many multitudes have there been, who have repented of sin, become models of holiness and piety, and yet have gone down in death. Yet God's solemn assurance to such is that i hey shall not die. Now it is an impeach-ment of the words of God, to say that this does not refer to the second death. But what a farce it would be to say to them that they shall not die the second death, if nobody is ever to die the sec-ond death The position of the Herald on the subject of the second death is truly most astonishing. It says : " The second death' is an expression which oc-curs only in the book of Revlation, and it is con-ceded by expositors that this book of symbols and figures should not be permitted to settle any doc-trine alone." A summary way, truly, to sweep away a troublesome book ! There are lines of prophecy found nowhere else but in the Revelation. Take, for instance, the seven churches, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, some of the symbols of Rev. 13, some of the statements of Rev. 18, 19, 20, and 21, etc. These settle no doctrine, forsooth, because they are in a book of figures and symbols ! What violence will men not do to the sacred record, to try to save a theory ! That the book is highly symbolical, no one will deny, but that it therefore does not teach great and mighty truths and contain many declarations given in plain and literal and not symbolic lan-guage, any believer in the inspiration of the Script-urea ought to be ashamed to assert. In chapter 20 :5, 6, it speaks of a resurrection. Does not this mean the literal resurrection so explicitly taught elsewhere in the Scriptures ?ŠNo sane man will deny it. It calls this the first resurrection. Then there must be another just as literal to be the second. It tells to whom the first is confined : it is the " blessed and holy." This leaves out all the wicked whom it then names as " the rest of the dead." The righteous and wicked of past genera-tions all lived once, but are now all alike dead. The first resurrection brings up all the righteous. They reign with Christ a thousand years. But " the rest of the dead," the wicked, lived not again, plainly says the record, till the thousand years were finished. What then 1ŠThen they will live again, or this record is a delusion and a snare. But no, says the Herald, they will never live again, there is no second resurrection, and no second death. This is in the Revelation, and therefore does not " settle " anything. This looks to us like the veriest trifling with the word of the Lord. But not to ignore entirely the expression "the second death," the Herald goes outside of the Bi-ble, and quotes from certain old Jewish writers, to show what it means.. Thus : " P. R. EliezerŁ says on this text [Ex. 19 : 12], 'Every idolater who says there is another God besides me, I will slay with the second death, from which no man can come to life again.' " Of course he will, if they don't repent. We agree to that. Then Julius Africanus is quoted who declares that Adam be-ing 930 years old, died " the second death." Then Adam is goneŠnever can live again. Now we know that just as Adam died, so Methuselah and Noah and Abraham died. Hence they can never live again. Bosh The testimony of such writ-ers, considering that the Bible has spoken on this question, is about as weighty as a thistle down. If John has it right, the second death does not come till the lake of fire, one thousand years after the resurrection of the righteous at the coming of Christ. " This," says John, " is the second death." Then what do we care what Eliezer, or Africanus, or Rubeni, or a thousand other Jewish or Christian rabbis, or any body else, says about it 1 Because death and hell (hades, the grave) personified are said to be cast into the lake of fire, the Herald jumps to the conclusion that every-thing cast in there is figurative, or, at least, that as they had never died before, nothing cast in there had ever died before. But the last verse of Rev. 20, says, " And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire," and this means persons, and can refer only to "the rest of the dead," of verse 5, for on the righteous who share in the first resurrection, the second death hath no power, but on the others a thou-sand years thereafter it does have power. We do not see how it could be plainer. In support of its position the Herald refers to a few texts, like Ps. 49 :14-19 ; Prov. 21 : 16 ; Isa. 26 : 14 ; Jer. 51 : 39, 57 ; Ex. 14 : 13. But there is not the slightest reason to apply these scriptures, and any others of this class, to anything else but this state of being. So far as this life is concerned, the wicked are like the beasts, to be seen no more, have no more a part in anything done under the sun, etc. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. The Herald seizes upon this expression, and says that as we deny the doc-trine of eternal misery, we cannot hold the fire to be eternal in duration. Very true, we do not. Then it says we must hold it to be eternal in its results. Very true again, we do. Hence it con-cludes triumphantly that the Sodomites can never be raised from that death. Hold, Jude and Peter speak about the " cities," and on them the effects of the fire will be eternal. They never will exist again as plague-spots of corruption. Thus the career of the guilty inhabitants was cut short, but they as individuals ( 2 Pet. 2 : 9) are still reserved " unto the day of Judgment to be punished." The Herald then quotes Matt. 25 : 41, 46, as follows, " Depart from me, ye cursed ( not for Adam's, but for their own sinsŠye cursed ), into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels . . . . And these shall go away into ever-lasting punishment," and then adds, " Can men be raised from everlasting punishment ? If so the devil and his angels will be raised after being de-stroyed. Thus would the Review make Univer-salists of us all." Alas has not the Herald yet learned that all this applies at the end of the thousand years, when the wicked receive their final doom, and Sa-tan and his hosts aŁre all destroyed I Neverthe-less such is the case. And from that destruction, which is to the wicked the second death, there is of course no recovery. This brief survey of some branches of this sub-ject does not by any means exhaust the testimony that might be given. But feeling that what has been said is all-sufficient, it is not necessary to pursue the question further. ŠWe should seek knowledge because it assists us to comprehend the goodness and power of God.
