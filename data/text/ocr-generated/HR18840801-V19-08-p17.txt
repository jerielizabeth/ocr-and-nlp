Bremond, of Paris, has invented a means of utilizing privy vaults as a source for electricity. Plates are lowered into the vaults, and the electricity is generated by the action of the products of decomposition upon the material of the plates. Wild Camels may be seen on the desert lands at the head of the Gulf of California. These are a remnant of a herd which many years ago was imported by the Government to act as beasts of burden for the army in New Mexico and Ari-zona. The Greely Expedition Rescued.ŠTwo of the relief ships sent out by the government in search of Greely and his comrades, who left this country three years ago to establish a signal sta-tion in the region of eternal ice and snow, have arrived at St. Johns, N. B., bringing with them Lieut. Greely and six of his comrades, the only survivors of the ill-fated expedition, seventeen having died of disease and starvation, and nearly all since January first of the present year. The men had been forced to live for months upon soup made from their sealskin clothing with lichens and shrimps. Hundreds of lives have been sacri-ficed in the gratification of a curiosity as idle as that of the small boy who started off in search of the treasures which he supposed were hidden in the end of a gaudy rainbow. It seems to many people about time that a stop was put to this fool-hardy business. USEFUL NOTES ON WATER. ONE gallon of distilled water weighs 10 pounds; one gallon of sea-water weighs 10.32 pounds; 1.8 cubic feet of water weigh one hun-dred-weight ; 36 cubic feet weigh one ton, equal to 224 gallons; one cubic foot contains 6f gal-lons. (The English standard, or Imperial gal-lon, is here referred to.) The average daily con-sumption of water in towns is from sixteen to twenty gallons per head. In pipes, the square of the diameter in inches equals pounds' weight of water per yard. Example : a 3-inch pipe holds nine pounds per yard. One-hundredth inchŁof rain is about one ton's weight to the acre. A nominal horse-power for a boiler requires one cubic foot of water per hour. Circular aper-tures are most effective for discharging water, since they have less frictional surface for the same area. The rena contracta is the best form of orifice for discharging water. The ordinary  speed to run a pump is from eighty to a hundred feet per minute. The pressure in pounds per square inch of a column of water is the hight in feet, multiplied by 594; or, for an approxima-tion, one-half pound pressure per square inch for each foot of hight. Water in flowing through an aperture has a velocity equal to that acquired by a heavy body falling freely from a hight equal to the distance between the center of the aper-ture and the surface of the water. Doubling the diameter of an aperture increases the flow of the water four-fold. A man can raise water from a well ten feet deep at the rate of thirty gallons per minute. The approximate time oc-cupied in discharging equal quantities of wa-ter under equal heads, through pipes of equal lengths, is 80 for a straight pipe, 200 for a curve, and 220 for a right angle.

The work of excavation is still being carried on, and new and interest-ing relics are being discovered nearly every day. A traveler., writing from Pompeii to the Ameri-can Architect, remarks as follows respecting this interesting place :Š " One thing is difficult to conceive without seeing it, and that is the gorgeousness of the in-teriors of the private houses. The colors are now faded; the columns are broken; the mosa-ics of the floors are generally nearly destroyed ; the fountains do not play ; the flower-beds are destitute of flowers : yet, even as it is, one is continually amazed by the brilliant effect of the interior vistas. In one house, the view from a triclinium across two courts, both surrounded by gaily-decorated Corinthian columns standing before walls painted from top to bottom in a va-riety of colors, is really dazing to the eyes. The old Pompeians lived in a rainbow atmosphere. "Another striking thing is the absolute clean-liness. You may say that the dirt has all been taken away by the Italian Government. That is true ; but it is quite evident that, in the old times it never was there. Our modern houses are not made to be clean, as were the Pom-peian residences. The walls, the floors, every corner of their homes, were finished with the most admirable workmanship. In their rooms no plaster ever fell ; for it was of such excellent material, and so well put on, that it soon became like marble. They had no wooden walls, no cracks where dust could penetrate. Water for cleansing was found in every part of the house, and ran off through perfect drains. All the ta-bles and bedsteads were of marble or bronze ; even the well-curbs and the borders of the flow-er-beds were of hewn stone. Hygiene must have come naturally to the old Pompeian. He evidently had no chance to get a typhoidal at-tack. The only class of diseases he could not provide against were the eruptive, and one of these carried him off at last."
