Meringue the top when baked, with the whites of the eggs well beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar, and a very little grated orange peel sprinkled over it. Lemon Pie.ŠTake four tablespoonfuls of lemon juice (one large one or two small ones will yield about this quantity) and two-thirds of a cup of sugar. Beat lemon juice and sugar together. Braid a slightly heaping tablespoon-ful of corn-starch with as little water as possible, and pour over it, stirring constantly, one-half pint of boiling waterŠthe water must be boiling so that it will sufficiently cook the starch to prevent it from settling. Add the lemon and sugar to the starch and let it cool, then stir in the yolks of two eggs and half the white of one well beaten together. Beat the mixture thor-oughly, pour into a deep crust, and bake. When done, cover with the remaining whites of the eggs, beaten with one and a half tablespoon-fuls of sugar, and brown lightly in the oven. Prune Pie.ŠWash the prunes thoroughly, and remove the stones. Add to them three times as much water as prunes, then place them in a porcelain kettle, cover closely, and simmer until perfectly tender and the juice thick. When cold, rub through a colander. Fill an under crust with the sifted prunes, and bake. This pie requires no sugar. The top may be orna-mented with strips of crust or pastry leaves, or if desired may be meringued with the whites of two eggs beaten to a stiff froth with two table-spoonfuls of sugar and a little grated lemon peel. Fruit Short Cakes.ŠBeat together one cup of thin cream, slightly warmed, a tablespoonful of yeast, and two small cups of flour. Set in a warm place till very light. Add sufficient warm flour to mix soft. Knead thoroughly for fifteen or twenty minutes. Divide into two equal por-tions, and roll into two sheets about one-half inch in thickness, making the centers a very lit-tle thinner than the outside, so that when risen they will not be highest in the center. Place in tins, and set in a warm place until perfectly risen, or until they have doubled their first thickness. Bake quickly. Spread one cake with fruit, and cover with the other. If the fruit is large, it may be chopped fine with a knife or mashed with a spoon. Plain BunsŠThese are the simplest of all cakes. Dissolve half a small cake of compressed yeast in a cupful of thin cream which has been previously warmed to bloodheat, add two cup-fuls of warm flour, and beat thoroughly together. Put in a warm place, and let it rise till very light. Add three tablespoonfuls of sugar mixed well with a half cup of warm flour, one-half cup of zante currants, and sufficient flour to make of the consistency of dough. Buns should be kneaded just as soft as possible, and from fif-teen to twenty minutes. Shape into biscuits a little larger than a walnut, place them on tins far enough apart so they will not not touch each  other when risen. Put in a warm place till they have risen to twice their first size, then bake in a moderately quick oven. If desired, the currants may be omitted, and a little grated lemon rind added for flavoring at the same time with the sugar, or a bit of citron may be placed in the top of each bun when shaping. When taken from the oven, sprinkle the top of each with moist sugar, if desired. Delicate Cake.ŠBeat together the yolk of one egg, one cup of sugar, and one cup of thin sweet cream, until all of a foam; add a little grated lemon rind for flavoring; stir in slowly, beating briskly all the time, two cups of gluten flour. This cake contains no soda or baking-powder, and to make it light it requires the in-corporation of as much air as possible. In order to do this, the beating must be continuous (any cessation will be likely to spoil the cake), not stirring round and round, but lifting the spoon in and out swiftly so as to make as many bub-bles of air as possible. When all the flour is added, add lastly the well-beaten whites of two eggs, stirring only just sufficient to mix them thoroughly through the whole, no more ; turn at once into small sheet-iron tins, which have been previously oiled and warmed, and bake in a moderately quick oven. This cake, if made according to directions, will be very light and delicate. It will not puff up much above its first proportions, but will be light throughout. A nice cake may be prepared in the same manner with common Graham or even white flour by the addition of a heaping tablespoon-ful of corn-starch, sifted into the flour, in the way in which baking-powder is ordinarily mixed with flour before using. This may be baked in a loaf, but is best baked in hot gem irons. Raised Jelly Cake.ŠWarm a cup of thin cream to blood heat, add one and a half cups of flour, a little salt if desired, one-fourth of a cup of sugar, and one-half a small cake of compressed yeast dissolved in a gill of thin cream, or a gill of liquid yeast. Set in a warm place, and let it rise till perfectly light. When well risen, add one-half cup of sugar, mixed with one-half cup of warm flour. Beat well, and set in a warm place to rise again. When risen a second time, add two eggs, whites and yolks beaten sepa-rately, and about one tablespoonful of flour. Turn the whole into three round baking tins, which have been previously oiled and warmed, and place where it will rise again for an hour or until it is all of a foam. Bake quickly in a moderately hot oven. Spread with fruit jelly. This cake may be varied in innumerable ways. A gold and silver cake may be made of it by tak-ing out one-third of it when risen the second time, adding the yolks of the eggs to the one third and the whites with some pulverized co-coanut to the other two-thirds. Make two sheets of the white and one of the yellow. Al-low them to become perfectly light before bak-ing. When baked, place the yellow portion be-tween the two white sheets, binding them to-gether with a little frosting. This cake may be varied also by adding a half cup of zante
