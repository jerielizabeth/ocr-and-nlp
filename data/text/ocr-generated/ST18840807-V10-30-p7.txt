AUGUST 7, 1884. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 471 THE characteristic mercy of God is shown in stopping short of the time proposed for the pestilence to continue, and accepted by David Jerusalem might have been destroyed, and the angel had already stretched forth his hand to afflict the city. But the Lord mercifully stayed the destructive hand short of the appointed affliction. Wordsworth says: "God stayed the hand of the angel from destroying Jerusalem in the same place where ho had stayed Abra-ham, who had the knife in his hand, from sac-rificing his son Isaac." "Buy these sheep, what have they done?" It is a prominent fact that the people are al-ways the sufferers for the misdeeds of their rulers, as children have often to suffer the conse-quences of parental sins. But it is seldom that a ruler is found like David, who, notwithstanding his faults, never tried to lay the blame upon others. Few are ready to personally make the sacrifices necessary to avert the evils of mis-government. AT the command of the prophet Gad, David went to offer sacrifice in the threshing-floor of Arautiah, the Jebusite. Araunah is called a king. and probably had been a king, and was even now a representative man of the Jebuaites. He. however, showed entire submission to David and was ready even to give him whatever was wanted for sacrifice. But-David had been the cause of the pestilence upon the people, and he did not propose to let another do the sacrificing rendered necessary as a coinselluence. So he in-sisted on purchasing the oxen and materials for fire, etc. For these he paid fifty shekels of silver. In 1 Chron. 21, we learn that David also bought the place for 600 shekels of silver From this chapter we also learn that the Lord answered David by fire when he had offered the sacrifice, which was positive proof of his pardon and the returning: favor of God. On this spot was erected the temple of Solomon, as is shown in chapter 22. Faost this lesson we learn that, though Israel be the Lord's people, yet it shall suffer, and suffer more than other peoples for its sins. That God's power in destruction is made manifest in order to show his power and grace in salvation. That God's plans may change, though his purposes are unalterable. That the true penitent confesses his sin, and seeks not to cast its responsibility upon others. That the altar is the meeting-place where God's judg-ment ends and his mercy begins.ŠLesson  Com-mentary. SO FAR as the record goes, this was David's last fall. The rest of his history, continued in 1 Kings, is concerning his physical decline, his charge to Solomon, and his death. Notwith-standing his honor and wealth in this world, he looked not for satisfaction until he should awake in t he likeness of his Saviour (Ps. 17 :15), who will bring the reward of every man when ho comes in glory. Rev. 22 :12. W. N. GLENN. gemptrante. ONWARD. BY MRS. JULIA LLOYD COLEOROVE. Tun life is such a boon, It is so bright; we love its morn, its noon, Its night. Our hearts go out For good, not ill, which lies aboutŠ Only one life, one chance to try Our strength or weakness ere we die. In the great fight we must prevail; We love the rightŠright cannot fail The slain lie thick around; They fought not well. Heedless, on slippery ground, They fell where wine-dregs lay, Thrown by the hands that hell obey, Regardless of the bitter blight Of those who plead through years of night, That &ere may be a safer way For those whose wills have gone astray. A time of light is thisŠ The path is clear. Down,'down the dark abyss, So near, none need to go. The tippler need not treitd the path of woe; Kind friends are on his track: The law shall hedge him back; And he himself shall min- I can, will be strong; I am a man. The boys, so glad and free, So full of health and hope and life and glee, And wealth of loving trust, They will not lay their honor in the dust; Though hurried on from joy to joy, They know the gilded, painted toy Of short-lived pleasure in the wine-cup's glow Is but a cheat which they can well forego. They know the bitter end That, fast or slow, the steps would downward tend; And so, with heart and voice, While mothers, sisters, friends rejoiceŠ The boys, the gay, glad boys Who love to make a gloriout noiseŠ They cry, " Let Prohibition rule the world, And Alcohol, the foe, down from his throne be hurled." Prescott, Ark. Be3Łond Their License. THREE saloon-keepers in Chicago were found guilty of selling liquor to minors, and the fol-lowing is the address of the judge who sen-tenced them:Š " By the law, you may sell to men and women if they want it. You have given bond and you are licensed to sell to them; no one has a right to molest you in your legal business, no matter what tiimilies are destroyed or rendered miser able; no matter what wives are treated with violence. what children starve or cry over the degradation of a parent; your business is legal-ized and no one nusy interfere with you in it. No matter what mother may agonize over the loss of a son, or sister blush for the shame of a brother, you have the right to disregard them all and pursue your legal calling; you are li-censed. You may fit up for your lawful trade. you may use all your arts to induce visitors; you may skillfully expose to view your choicest wines and captivating beverages; you may then induce thirst by all contrivances, producing a raging appetite for drinks, and then you may supply to the full, because it is lawful; you have paid for it; you have a license. You may allow boys, almost children, to frequent your saloons. You may hold the cup to their lips, but you must not let them drinkŠthat is unlawful. But while you have special privileges for the money you pay, this poor privilege of selling to children is denied you. Here the parents have a right to say: Leave my son to me until the law gives you the right to destroy. Do not anticipate that terrible moment when I can as-sert for him no further right of protection; 'twill be soon enough for me, for his mother, for his sister, for his friends and the community to see him take his road to death. Give him to us in his childhood at least. Let us have a few years of his youth, in which we may enjoy his innocence, to repay in small degree for the love we have lavished upon him. " This is something you who now stand pris-oners at this bar, have not paid fbr; for this is not embraced in your license. For this offense the court sentences you to ten days' imprison-ment in the county jail, and that you pay a fine of seventy-five dollars and costs; and that you stand committed until the fine and costs of this prosecution are paid." The Ex-Saloon Keepers. THE saloon is beginning to go from IowaŠin some places voluntarily, in others involuntarily. Even .Dubuque landlords are notifying saloon-keepers that their leases end on the 4th of J uly. In the interior cities many of the proprietors of bars are publicly announcing their intention to quit, and some have already done so. We know of quite a number of those who are seeking a better business and honorable employment. In Des Moines quite a number of our best people have united in recommending a retiring saloon-keeperŠgood man who was a gallant soldierŠfor mail-carrier in the postal service. He is well qualified for the position, deserves well of his countrymen, has a family to support, and now that he is quitting this traffic, he finds his neighbors willing to serve him, and help him to better employment. This is right. It is to be hoped that in ever community in Iowa temperance people and all others will unite in aiding the men who are quitting the saloon business, to get honorable employment. Many of them have impulses toward better citizenship, and the temperance people will encourage them to become useful citizens. The Register, for its part, begs that the best people of all opinions join in and show these men good-will and an active disposition to aid them in securing such business as will afford them a living. Now is the time for the kind hand and the' kind word. The warfare in Iowa has been upon the saloon,  as a public curse, and not upon the saloon-keeper as an individual. As theirbnsiness is doomed to go, and they are going to quit it, they should be met in the right spirit and en-couraged into joining the general throng of thrifty, industrious, contented people ill Iowa, making a living by honorableineans.ŠIowa  State Register. AT  a recent lecture in San Francisco, Mrs;  Ellen Foster referred to drinking among worastii and said: "I say the women are drinking dread-fully, and there is to-day an asylum in New York for inebriate women, and in that asylum the wives and daughters of merchants residing on Fifth Avenue are placed to be cured of this hor-rible appetite for strong drink. In Boston, in Chicago. and in your own city of San Francisco drinking among women is increasing daily, and among women, too, who arc socially high, and are mothers of children and wives of prosperous men." MANY a smoker throws away the stump of his cigar because he does not like the flavor of it. He does not know why the flavor is un-pleasant to him, but it is caused by nicotine, the active principle of tobacco, and a violent poison. This accumulates in the base of the cigar with every draft of the smoke, and the man, notic-ing the unpleasant flavor, throws the stump away. This reservoir of nicotine finds its way into the cigarette, and the person who smokes it, gets in a condensed form the poison which so often works mischief on the brains of habitual smokers.ŠExchange. THERE never was a stricter temperance pledge than that of Solomon. We think it sufficient to say, Drink not; but be said,  "Look not  on the wine." The color, the sparkle, the very sight of the intoxicating draught is enough to awaken the appetite in some men, so that it becomes necessary for them to make a covenant even with their eyes.ŠEx. ON David's sacrifice, Matthew Henry says: "Those who know not what religion is, all whose care it ie to make it cheap and easy to themselves, are best pleased with that which Ł costa them least pains or money. What have we our substance for but to honor God with it, and bow can it be better bestowed." With this principle agree the words of David's honored son and successor: " Honer the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase." Prov. 3 : 9. Sacrifice has ever been deemed a token of earnestness and devotion, and is the practical basis of the redemption of fallen man. The remission of our sins cost the life of the SOH of God, can wo do less than honor him with our substance?
