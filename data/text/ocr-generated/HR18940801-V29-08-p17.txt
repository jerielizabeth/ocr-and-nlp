Any young woman who is a good swimmer and practices the art, will soon find the re-strictions of the corset and tight bands utterly un-bearable, and will break away from the fetters of fashionable dress, regardless of consequences, which, however, need be no other than improvement in good looks, in grace of carriage, dignity of bearing, and general good health. Although swimming is little practiced by women in this country, it is by no means a novel exercise with the women of many other lands. The women of the Sandwich Islands are as much at home in the water as are their sons and husbands,Šin fact seem to be almost as much at ease in the water as on land. The same is true with women of nearly all savage tribes who live adjacent to bodies of water. And plenty of good swimmers may be found among the women of some civilized lands, and even among the most aristocratic circles ; for example, according to The Princess : "Numerous lady members of Euro-pean royal families are good swimmers. The ladies of the Austrian royal house are all fond of aquatic pursuits. The Empress of Austria used to be a fine swimmer. The Queen of Spain is equally fond of the water. She bathes every morning, and is a swim-mer of much skill and courage,Šgreatly to the astonishment of the Spanish ladies. The habits of the Queen of Spain are very simple and regular. Years ago it was customary for her to rise at seven in the summer and eight in the winter ; now she generally stays in bed until nine, having cocoa and toast before getting up. Breakfast proper is not quite punctual now, but in summer it is still often partaken of out of doors. This meal, as a rule, as far as the queen is concerned, consists of eggs, thin bread and butter, Ł and tea ; but occasionally porridge is substituted. One Indian attendant and one serv- ant wait at the table. During breakfast the ar- rangements for the day are made." Wheeler.Š "Doctor, I wish you'd make out my bill."

A SIMPLE GYMNASIUM.ŠThe idea that elaborate apparatus is required for the proper development of the body was long ago shown to be incorrect by Ling, who demonstrated very clearly that the most  perfect system of gymnastics is one in which the human body itself affords all needed apparatus, con-stituting itself at one and the same time both the weight to be lifted and the levers, ropes, and pulleys for lifting. A modern demonstration of the same idea is afforded by Sandow, who claims to have employed in the development of his magnificent physique nothing more than a simple pair of five-pound dumb bells which he uses in the morning. Dr. Lydston states Sandow's measurements to be : Chest, 46 inches ; waist, 29 inches ; upper arm, x9/ inches ; thigh, 27 inches ; forearm, 19 inches ; calf, 17% inches; chest expansion, 14. iinches. THE average walking pace of a healthy man or woman is said to be seventy-five steps a minute. STOMACH AND CARDIAC TROUBLE PRODUCED BY THE HABITUAL POSTURE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. Š Doctor Motais, of Angiers, points out that the habitual posture of school children is an important cause of myopia and of spinal curvature ; it is also a cause of dyspepsia, because the bending forward causes constriction of the stomach. The faulty po-sition impairs the current of blood through the ves-sels of the neck, and the result is cardiac palpitation. Most cardiac and stomach troubles in students and clerks can be made to disappear by correcting the faulty posture.Š Medical Age. A PLEA FOR THE SPEAKING VOICE.ŠPerhaps 1)e-cause speaking is so easy, explains why we fail in it. So little effort is required that we seem to do very little, and yet how much lies hidden in that word fitly spoken ! The tones of some voices stay with us always. They seem to weave a spell about us, from whose thralldom we would not escape. Summon aid from your retinue of vocal workmen when you speak; use only the necessary parts of the vocal ap-paratus, and not every muscle of the throat, and so save yourself from becoming a victim of that dread complaint, " clergyman's sore-throat," which is the natural result of over-strained throat muscles. All these ills can be avoided by opening the way from the diaphragm to the lips, keeping it free from ob-stacles and hindrances. A little wholesome thought, and the matter of plain and pleasant talking is a solved problem.Š Margaret Blanche Best, in the Chautauquan. EXERCISE in the open air all you can, and do n't forget to breathe deeply ; it will be your physical salvation.
