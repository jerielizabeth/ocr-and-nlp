GENERAL HYGIENE. 227 4 of national exasperation, the Cossacks refused to fire upon Marshal Murat, and carried their admi-ration of his horsemanship to the length of invit-ing him to become their " hetman." " C'est un charmeur," said ev rri Prince Gortschakoff, after his introduction to the prince elect of Bulgaria, and tried to prevent his personal interview with the czar when the interests of Russian politics required his ruin. In the czarovitch phase of his existence, the future autocrat, however, had several opportunities to make the personal acquaintance of the Hessian volunteer, and before the end of the campaign, became so fond of him that he invited him to St. Petersburg, and afterward emphatically indorsed his nomination for the vacant throne on the Danube. The offer to accept permanent service in the Russian army would perhaps have been accepted under those circumstances, if the six months' cam-paign had not acquainted the prince with the shady side of the Muscovite characterŠthe almost uni-versal prevalence of intemperance and peculation, and the almost brutal arrogance of superior officers in the treatment of their subalterns. Under the in-fluence of vodka and slibocitz, the typical Colonel Knoutusoff becomes first maudlin affectionate, then grandiloquent, and finally downright abusive ; and the adventure-loving volunteer who would have rG braved the extremes of hardship and danger, felt his constitutional inabilty to submit to deliberate insults and the wanton maltreatment of the men under his charge. He knew too much of martial law to waste 4i time on expostulations, but the necessity of swallow-ing his resentment affected him physically as severe disappointments affect persons of less sensitive or-ganization. Even in his cadet years an undeserved reproof would convulse his nerves and spoil his appetite for the rest of that day ; nay, the mere men-tion of an act of outrageous unfairness had some- times a similar effect, and the recital of General Haynau's treatment of the Hungarian patriots filled his eyes with tears of indignation, " causing his teacher to call him aside and offer him permission to retire to his room, as he appeared to have been taken sick." He returned to his native city, and had nearly completed his studies at the Darmstadt Lyceum when, like Marshal Bernadotte at his country seat, he was astounded by the report that the represen-tatives of a foreign nation had called him to a vacant throne. The honor was the more flattering from having been entirely unsolicited, and the offer was made irresistible by his personal impression of the  Danubian principalities. Bulgaria, stretching nearly five hundred miles from west to east, with the Danube for its northern border and the high Balkans on the south, has a magnificent seaboard Šnatural bounda-ries, in fact, almost as well defined as those of Italy, which it rivals in its scenic and climatic attractions. The inhabitants, even after three centuries of Turkish misrule, are, all in all, the healthiest race of conti-nental Europe, brave, hospitable, fond of athletic sports, passionately fond of poetry, loyal to their chief, but withal as impatient of oppression as their kinsmen, the heroic Montenegrians. The Bulgarian patriot Stambuloff who had met the prince in the Balkans, indorsed the plan with the re-mark that he "hardly knew whom to congratulate most, the nation or its intended ruler." The approval of the czar settled the matter, and during the next sixteen months Prince Alexander was kept as busy as Nicolas Carnot in the crisis of the French Revolution. He " renounced his right to sleep," and contented himself with cat-naps of thirty or forty minutes, to utilize the nights for drosky trips along the frontiers, where he inspected forts, in-trenched camps, and drilled recruits, to forestall the risks of the expected rupture with the Turkish gov-ernment. In the intervals of those preparations he studied the natural resources of the principality. Unlike most other countries of southern Europe, Bulgaria has preserved the wealth of its primitive forests; droughts are rare; and the farming districts need only good roads to become as valuable as the gardenspots of southern France, to which they exactly correspond in latitude and climate. Three highways were surveyed and graded from Sofia east to the Dobro Pass, and north to Tirnova and Nicopolis ; and in default of a sufficient number of male laborers, women were employed at the same wages, the.Prince laughingly quoting Lord Byron's letter from Thessalia, where he " saw peasant girls work in the quarries, and no reason why they should be sentenced to a perpetuity of indoor labor." The new sovereign, soon intrusted with the prac-tical dictatorship of the country, also turned his at-tention to law reforms and the sanitary improve-ments of the squalid river cities. In the hope of enjoying a period of protracted peace, he had estab-lished a museum for the collection of Roman antiq-uities, in which European Turkey is almost as rich as Spain, when the warlike preparations proved, after all, the salvation of the country. A jealous neighbor, King Milan of Servia, made the negotia-tions with the East Rumehan rebels a pretext for invading Bulgaria, and at first rather enjoyed the * Ł
