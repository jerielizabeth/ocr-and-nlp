64 THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. HARSH WORDS. The Garden. WHEN we sow goods seeds in the garden, we wish them to grow up and make nice plants, -and roots, and flowers. If we let the weeds grow, they will choke the good 'seeds and spoil ;hem. We must hoe up the weeds. The mind is like a garden. It must be taken care of. Good plants and 'flowers will not be found in the garden unless the seed be planted. And then, when the seed comes up, the young plants must be taken care of. But weeds will spring up of themselves, without being planted; and, if they are left to grow, they will grow faster and stronger i Lan the good plants, and choke them to eath. You must pull up the weeds if you want the plants to grow. It is so with the mind. The soil is good; but angry and wicked thoughts are apt to spring up there ; and, if you let them grow, they will choke the good thoughts, and kill them. If you would be good, you must pull up the wicked thoughts and throw them away, as you would the weeds in the garden. A Manly Answer. ALL honor to the boy who cannot be laughed out of doing right. Five boys, pu-pils in a boarding school, were in their room. Four of them, contrary to the rules, engaged in a game of cards. The fifth was not stand-ing and looking on, to see how the game would go, but engaged in work of his own. It so happened that one of the players was called out. " Come," said the others to their compan-ion, " it is too bad to have the game stop here in the middle. Come and take his place." "I do not know one card from another." "That makes no difference; we will teach you. Come now, do not let our sport be spoiled." The boy perceived that this was the de-cisive moment. Ah, just such are the crit-ical points, which are sometimes the turning-points in life. His resolution was immediately taken. He made no more excuses, but at once planted himself square upon principle. " My father does not wish me to play cards, and I shall not act contrary to his wishes." This ended the matter. It established his position among his companions. It com-pelled theif:respeet, and preserved him from temptation in the future. The Useful Needle.-A Fable. How LITTLE notice is ever taken of you in the world !" said a pin to a needle. You are always about your work, slipping in and out so softly, but never stopping to be praised. When a pretty dress is finished, who thinks of the needle that sowed it ? Even the holes which you make are as small that they close up directly after you." I'm content to be useful, said the needle. I do not ask to be praised. I do not re-main in my work, it is true ; but I leave behind me a thread, which shows that my course has not been in vain." MORAL.-So let us pass quietly through life, doing our duty as we go, remembered for some good work left behind, when we ourselves have departed. DAYBREAK CONCERT.-It was our priv-ilege very recently to attend a matinee given by our feathered artists, the robins and bluebirds. In fact, it is just the begin-ning of the season for this out-door troupe. Amid the chill and gloom of this laggard spring, it was cheering, on being aroused at the unseasonable hour of half-past four, to hear their merry warbling. Sometimes it was a solo, then a duet, and again the full chorus swelled out in grand harmony. It is a wonder that a choir of these native singers has not been thought of for the com-ing Peace Jubilee. But then the hour they choose for their entertainments and are in the best voice is so very unseasonable that the performers would lack an audience. Think of rising at three on a June morning to attend a concert ! Only birds and babies believe in real matinees ; not those after-noon 'affairs to which modern circumlocu-tion has given the misnomer "matinee," but the genuine thing ; for to them three o'clock means three in the morning. Does one ever take an early train, or chance for some reason to see the sun rise in summer or spring, without feeling how wasteful he is of the golden freshness of morning hours ? But the birds have their way and we ours. If any one is incredulous of the quality of their morning orchestra, let him secure a hearing, the only expense being that of early waking.-Boston Transcript. THE DESERTER.-Not long since, their came to my house one who had been in the army. He was poor, and wanted help. " Why not apply for a pension ?" I asked ; and I wrote for him to Washington, present-ing his claims. But the answer came-" The man of whom you write was once in the army, but deserted ; he can draw no pension. The government has no money for deserters." Are there not many in the church very much like this man ? They have enlisted in the service of the Lord Jesus, their names have gone on the roll, but they are not in the ranks ; they are not at their proper posts ; they do not respond to the call ; they have run away ; they are deserters. They do not like the sacrifice the Christian soldier must make, nor the hard work he must per-form, so they have left the ranks. But these are all known in the heavenly city ; their names registered. They can get no heavenly pension, no bright and glorious reward, in the city -of that great King. There will be no great and everlasting joy  for them ; no crown, no harp of praise, no song of victory and love, no glad welcome of the King ; no pension ; they are desert-ers. They put a hand to the plough, but looked back ; they are not fit for the king-dom of Heaven. Are you one of them ?-American Messenger. BY-AND-BY-THINK OF THAT !-On a cold, windy March day, I stopped at an apple-stand, whose proprietor was a rough-looking Italian. I alluded to the severe weather, when with a cheerful smile and tone, he re-plied : " Yes, pretty cold ; but by-and-by-tink of dat !" In other words, the time of warm skies, flowers, and song, is near. the humble vender little thought of the impres-sion made by his few words any more than we usually appreciate the responsibility which attends the power of speech. " By-and-by-think of that !" Yes, soul in trial, shivering in the frost of disappointment or winds of adversity, there is a sweet by-and-by, think of that, if faith in God your Saviour permits you to; for soon'the eternal light and melody shall be yours. What soothing, animating power in those simple words, all along the path of Christian pil-grimage ! Under every shadow, in every tearful experience, say to the troubled spirit, "By-and-by - think of that !"- American Messenger. Money Receipted. Each 1 Dollar.

SPEAK not harshly-could we scan The secret, inmost soul of man, Then his bleeding breast would show Furrows deep of pain and woe- How those wounds are warped and wrung, By an angry, bitter tongue. Speak not harshly-learn to feel Another's woes, another's weal;  Of malice, hate, and guile, instead, By friendship's holy bonds be led;  For sorrow is man's heritage From early youth to hoary age. Speak not harshly-Ohl how drear Cold unkindness meets the ear;  When the soul with gloom oppressed, Longs for love to cheer the breast, Refluent ebbs the gushing flow, That warmed our hearts with genial glow. -Bel.
