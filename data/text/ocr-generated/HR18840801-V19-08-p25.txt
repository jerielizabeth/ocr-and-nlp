249 heat may be abstracted from the body almost ad libitum., and the temperature may thus be controlled with a rapidity and a degree of cer-tainty which cannot be approached by any other method. In a still more recent case, in which the same treatment was employed, the temper-ature of the patient had reached 106° F. in spite of the vigorous application of ordinary measures of treatment, such as cold compresses, etc.; but it was, in four or five hours, brought down to nearly 100° by the use of the cold enemas. The advantages of this method are : 1. It may be employed without wetting or moving the pa-tient ; very frequently a patient will sleep con-tinuously during the administration of the treat-ment ; 2. It seldom causes chilliness, which is frequently a disturbing symptom, especially in fevers of a low type, and even, when the temper-ature is alarmingly high, causing the patient to dread the employment of sponging with cool or tepid water; 3. It is not necessary to employ cold water, a temperature of 80° or even 85° being thoroughly efficient. In the majority of cases, however, water of 70° or even 60° may be employed without danger. The water comes in such immediate contact with surfaces filled with large blood-vessels that a temperature but a few degrees below that of the body is more effective than very much colder water applied to the sur-face. In cases in which the use of the cool enema is attended by chilliness, this uncomfortable symptom may usdally be relieved by the ap-plication of a hot bag or fomentations to the spine or to the pit of the stomach. The simple measures of treatment we have described will be found more effective in lower-ing the temperature than any or all other rem-edies which have ever been recommended for this purpose. MAD-DOG BITE. AN English doctor gives the following advice respecting dog bites:Š " The bites of a healthy dog cannot cause hy-drophobia. This is a well-established fact. As it is difficult to determine the state of health of a dog at the time he bites, the wound should be treated as if the dog were rabid. Dog-bites should be treated at once, by the person bitten or a bystander, by sucking the wound if pos-sible ; by enlarging the wound with a penknife to encourage bleeding; by hot-water fomenta-tion; by free washing with cold water; by liga- ture, a piece of string tied between the wound and the heart. After bleeding has been en-couraged and the wound washed, apply hot iron, as a heated penknife, a small key, etc., or caus-tics, as pure nitric, sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, nitrate of silver, acetic acid, carbolic acid, ammonia, salt, Condy's fluid, or a piece of hot cinder. If near a chemist's, the person bitten should run there, keeping his mouth to the wound, if possible, and spitting out the blood extracted ; if near a medical man's house, run there at once ; if in a part where the person bit-ten cannot apply his mouth, some bystander should suck the wound. No harm can follow from thus lending assistance. The dog inflict-ing the bite should be kept under observation for at least fourteen days. It will soon be seen whether he is healthy or not. If he is healthy, there is no fear of future development of hydro-phobia. If the person bitten experiences shoot-ing pain up the arms or other parts of the body, three or four Turkish baths should be taken; if he is nervous, he should place himself under the care of his medical attendant. I have treated some hundreds of cases of dog-bites from all parts of the country, and I am glad to say that those bitten have not experienced any after-symptoms." Gentle reader, take our advice. Do n't fall to sucking the calf of your leg, applying hot irons, aqua fortis, live coals, etc., unless you have reason to believe that you have been bit-ten by a mad dog. The chances are a thousand to one that the dog is not mad, and ten to one that no harm will come to you if the dog is mad, if he has bitten you through your clothing. A few months ago a traveling man called upon us to have us cure up an ugly sore which a doctor had made by cutting and cauterizing, because he had received a scratch from a cross dog. The dog's bite would have been well in a day or two; but the doctor's " bite " laid him up for a week. If you are bitten by a dog, do n't be-come insane on the subject of hydrophobia, but use a little common sense. ACCIDENTAL POISONING. THE human race is exposed to danger from poisoning on every hand. These enemies to life are not only produced in the various arts in which man is engaged, but are produced in pro-fusion by nature under various circumstances, and often under such specious guises as to ren-der the most constant vigilance necessary to avoid injury. The materia medica also affords
