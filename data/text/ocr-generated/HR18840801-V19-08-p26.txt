250 COOD P3iRikr17`111. a long list of poisons, many of which are the most rapidly fatal of any known. Thus man is surrounded on every hand with danger to life from either direct or indirect poisoning, in ad-dition to all the various other causes of disease to which attention has been more specially called in previous portions of this work. In the strictest sense, a poison is any sub-stance, which, when received into the body, oc-casions morbid action or disorders of the vital functions ; since anything may become a poison if taken in sufficient quantity, as a person may be made sick by overeating, even of the most wholesome food. The general usage of the term, however, confines its application to such sub-stances as when received into the body are capa-ble of producing death or severe illness. An antidote is some substance capable of neutraliz-ing, or favorably modifying, the injurious effects of the poison upon the system. General Treatment for Poisoning.ŠWhatever treatment is employed, should be applied with the utmost promptness and thoroughness. As a general rule, the first thing to be thought of is an emetic. A teaspoonful of ground mus-tard, or an equal quantity of powdered alum in a goblet of warm water, generally acts with promptness. If neither alum nor mustard are at hand, a teaspoonful of salt may be taken in the same way, or tepid water alone may be em--ployeal; and if taken rapidly and in sufficient 'quantity, vomiting will be very likely to occur. In case it is not produced promptly, the throat should be tickled with the finger or a feather. An eminent physician has recommended the fol-lowing as a general antidote for poisons. It renders insoluble such poisons as zinc, arsenic, digitalis, etc., and so makes them inert. A sat-urated solution of sulphate of iron, two ounces; calcined magnesia, two ounces; washed animal charcoal, or bone-black, one ounce. The iron solution should be kept in one bottle, and the calcined magnesia and charcoal in another. When wanted for use, add the contents of the two bottles to a pint of water, shake thoroughly, and take from three to six tablespoonfuls. Sleeplessness.ŠThis most annoying and ex-hausting symptom may be greatly relieved by attention to the following suggestions :- 1. Retire early, having taken, an hour or so before, sufficient muscular exercise to induce slight weariness. 2. Eat nothing within four hours of bed-time. If " faint " at the stomach, drink half a glass of hot lemonade, made as already directed. If  this does not suffice, a mellow sweet or subacid apple may be taken an hour before retiring, un-less fruit occasions pain or acidity. 3. If feverish, the skin being hot and dry, take a light hand bath with tepid water upon retiring. 4. If troubled with cold feet and hands, em-ploy the means suggested for the cure of cold feet. 5. Sleep in a cool room, but take care to see that the bedding is well aired and dry, and the room well ventilated. 6. When nervousness causes loss of sleep, there are various methods of inducing slumber, one of the most efficient being slow, deep, and steady breathing. By this means the lungs are filled with blood, and the brain is thus relieved of the congestion which causes wakefulness. Hot Milk in Diarrhea. Š Dr. Benjamin Clarke states that in the East Indies great use is made of hot milk as a remedy for diarrhea. The milk need not be boiled, but should be taken hot as possible without discomfort. Hot milk is a most excellent remedy in many cases of dyspepsia. It can often be taken by persons who are unable to take milk in any other way. It is not likely to make a person " bilious," as many persons suggest when the use of milk is recommended to them. It is only necessary in the latter class of cases to note that care must be taken respecting the articles of food taken at the same time. When milk is used as a dietetic remedy, it must be made the principal article of diet. It agrees best with grain preparations. Vegetables, fruits, and meats of all kinds should be avoided when taking a milk diet. It may be taken in the quantity of one to three quarts per diem. How to Give a Fomentation.ŠFold a piece of flannel of sufficient size, four to eight thick-nesses. Dip into hot water, taking care to sat-urate completely. Fold into a towel, and wring by twisting the ends of the towel. Throw across the part to be fomented a piece of flannel twice the size of the fomentation. Spread the hot flannelŠwhich should be wrung so it will not dripŠover the dry flannel, making it cover the part to be treated as accurately as possible, and fold over it the extra portion of the dry flannel so as to retain the heat. By this means the heat reaches the skin gradually, and a much higher temperature will be borne and with much less discomfort, than when the dry flannel is omitted.
