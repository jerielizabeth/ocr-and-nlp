And the Immediate Coming of Christ, and the Inconsistencies of the Opposition Exposed. BY ELD, D. T. BOURDBAU. Taken 1nalnly fhnn sunnning-tlp lipeeoh by Eld,, Bourdea" in a .J!'renclt .D4scussion hi'msel/ and Eld, Auger, held at St. A.nŁne, on. 'the evenings of July IJ-9, 1874. I. Poss·ibility and importance of derstaluling the prophecies. 1. The prophecies are a part of the elation of God to man, and Moses affirms that "the secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are vealed belong unto us and to our children forever." Deut. 29:29. 2. They form an important part of those Scriptures which St. Paul declares to be "profitable" (2 Tim. 3: 16), and which can therefore be understood. 3. As history given in advance, they peciaJ.ly those fulfilling in our day ) fumish a stronger evidence in favor of the divine origin of the Scriptures than miracles formed in Bible times; for, to substan-BATTLE CREEK, MICH., THIRD-DAY, AUGUST. 18, 1874. tiate miracles performed in past ages, we simply have the written testimony, as in favor of prophecy fulfilling in o'ur times, we have besides the written ny our own senses to seize the events ing the prophecy ; and thus prophecy is made a living miracle, whereby God is made especially near to us, and speaks to us as it were face to face. 4. They are not dark sayings, but are compared to a candle which shines in a dark place. 2 Pet. 1: 19. As such, they show us our whereabouts and our dangers; and certainly we would not refuse a light in a dark night; neither should we refuse the light of prophecy. 5. Christ and Peter command and hort us to pay attention to and be mindful of the prophecies. Matt. 24: 15; 2 Pet. 3: 2. G. According to the English translation, the Holy One of Israel, our Maker, mands us to ask and command him cerning things to come, Isa. 45: 11, as though it was our privilege to understand them. 7. Accordingly, ancient pt·ophets, as amples of the church, prayed, wept, and fasted, to get an insight into future events. Dan. 9 : 
3 ; Rev. 5 : 4, etc. 8. A blessing is pronounced on those who read and on those who hear what is said to be the most difficult portions of prophecy ; ReY. 1 : 
3; but none can be blessed in reading the prophecies or in hearing them read, less they can be understood. 9. Without the prophecies it would be difficult to prove that Christ is the Messiah, and Christ and the apostles frequently pealed to the prophecies to establish this doctrine. 10, Prophecy is the burden of at least twenty books of the Bible, besides being interspersed in nearly every other book ot Holy "r rit; so that were the prophecies cluded from the Scriptures, we would be left with a sieve-like Bible much smaller than our present Bible. This would be ing away from the words of this blessed book. Rev 22: 19. Yet this is virtually done by saying that the prophecies are forbidden ground, and cannot be stood. 11. They are very firm, 2 Pet. 1 : 
19, and therefore we can depend upon them. 12. They are practical, showing the ties of men in different ages of the world. Rev. 1: 3; 22: 10, 14, and consequently it is highly necessary to comprehend them. 13. We see the importance that God taches to them in the scriptural fact that "surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." Amos 3 : 7. 14: At the time of the end, or at the time determined, knowledge was to crease on the prophecies, Dan. 12, and the seal which had been placed on some of the prophecies was to be removed by the piring of events fulfilling them. Rev. 10. II. On precision or positiveness. Although we are forbidden to be positive as to the day and hour of Christ's second coming, yet, 1. We may be positive as to the meaning of prophecies to Christ's coming when those prophecies are either fulfilled or fulfilling; otherwise such prophecies were written in vain, unless for the purpose of puzzling men's brains. 2. It is necessary to be positive in gard to God's prophetic word at the close of each dispensation and when solemn and important events, involving the ruin or salvation of men, according as they relate themselves to them, are about to transpire; for example, before the flood, before the destruction of the cities of the plain, fore the :first and second destructions of Jerusalem, before Christ's first and second advents. If God now deals with men as he has in past ages, he certainly will give them through his word means of ing when the coming of Christ is ing. 3. The Scriptures teach plainly that a message relative to the proximity of the Judgment and the coming of Christ shall be proclaimed by the church living at the close of this dispensation ; Rev. 14 : 6 ; 
10 ; Matt. 2;j ; but such a message can never be heralded, and consequently the ures foretelling its proclamation are rious if it be true that the church may never be positive in regard to the near ing of Christ. Then men are at full liberty to reject the closing portions of all those long chains of prophecy that bring us to the end of the gospel age. They may also repudiate all those isolated and short prophecies that are thrown in to indicate the approach of the day of God. Then the unfaithful servant who smites ot· poses those who proclaim the coming of Chri.st near, Matt. 24, needs no censure from his Lord ; and the mockers who were to arise in the last days, 2 Pet. 3 : 
3, 4, ing, « Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning," should mock on; fot· no one can know thing about the nearness of Christ's ing, as there are no changes to indicate it. But, 4. When the great signR of the coming of Christ in the sun, moon, and stars, have appeared, we are commanded to ''know that the Son of man [French translation] is near, even at the doors." Matt. 24. and we may also then know that we have reached the last generation, with the same certainty that we know that summer is nigh when the trees put forth their leaves in the spring. 5. It was the precision and positiveness of Noah and his family that proved their salvation, because it was connected with faith in God's prophetic word which led to a reform and to good works; while a lack of precision on the part of those who rejected Noah's preaching, based on God's word, led to unbelief and tŁuin. It was so at Christ's first coming; and will be the same at the time of his second coming. Luke 18:8. Indefiniteness as to the ness of Christ's coming, when that coming is impending, excludes the use that is made in the prophecies of the swift approaching day of God as a strong incentive to ance and holy living, and as a means of testing the genuineness of the love of the church for her t·eturning Lord ; for if we love the Lord, we shall long to see him. It is therefore as necessary to J?reach the mediate coming of Christ m our day, if the special signs of his coming have peared, as it was to preach the approach of the deluge in the days of Noah, or to claim the coming of the Messiah in the time of John the Baptist. Evidences of Ch1ist's soon coming. 1. The gospel has been preached in all the world as a witness to all nations, and the end may be expected. Matt. 24 : 14. Historical authorities: J. 0. Choules, thor of the greatest work ever published on missions, and Mr. James, agent of the American Bible Society. 2. The special signs of Christ's coming in the sun, moon, and stars, have appeared. They occurred immediately after the lation of the church by her persecutors, and we may know that Christ is near, even at the doors; and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than for the words of Christ on this point to fail. Matt. 24 : 35. The sun was supernaturally darkened May 19, 1780, and the night following, the moon refused to give her light; and the night of vember 13, 1833, witnessed by far the greatest display of falling stars or meteors that has ever visited our earth. My thorities are President Dwight, in Ct. Hist. Collections, Tract No. 379 of Am. Tract Society, Noah W ehster, Prof. Olmstead, the famous meteorologist, and Mr. Smith, tronomer of New York city, etc. 3. In following the prophecy of the en seals, we arrive at the same signs under the sixth seal, and reach the same able oonclusions. Rev. 6 ; 
7 : 1. 4. In pursuing the interesting prophecy of the seven trumpets, we see that the NUMBER 9. sixth trumpet closed by the fall of the toman Empire in passing into the hands of the allied powers of Europe in 1840, and that just at that time a message on time, connected with the finishing up of the work of the gospel, was going by sea and by land agreeably to the prophecy of Rev. 10, thrown in between the sixth and enth trumpets. Rev. 7-11. 5. We have reached the end of all phetic periods, the longest of which, the 2300 days, or years, ended in 1844, when Christ entered upon the closing work of his priesthood in the sanctuary in Heaven, preparatory to his coming to earth. Dan. 8:14. 6. The man of sin, papacy, has arisen, has had his prosperous, but cruel and dacious, reign of 1260 years over the tions; he has lost his civil dominion; the end is right upon us; and the caution of Paul to not look for Christ is removed. 2 Thess. 2 ; 
Dan. 7 : 
25, 26. 7. In fulfillment of prophecy, the foul and degrading delusion of modern ualism is performing its wonders and doing its work of destt·uction, while the church are looking for Christ, who is about to come as a thief. Isa. 8:17-20; Matt. 24: 24; 2 Thess. 2:8-12; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3: 6-9; Rev. 16: 13-15. 8. And finally, the three advent sages of Rev. 4 are going forth. The last of these is developing a people keeping all God's commandments, and its proclamation is to be immediately followed by the un-· mingled wrath of God, and the appearing of the Son of man on the white cloud. This synopsis might be greatly extended. IV. Literality of tlw signs in the sun, moon, and stars. It has been claimed that these signs are figurative, representing the corrupting and darkening influence of error, the fall of the church, or the fall of large and small powers of earth. As the work of corrupting the truth commenced in the apostolic age and continued for ages, and as the church tatized in departing from the truth, and earthly powers fell in the first century and onward, this application would give the world the signs of the immediate coming of Christ more then seventeen hundred years ago ! thus deceiving the world for ages!! Our reasons for believing these signs to be literal are briefly as follows:-1. They are given in a literal prophecy in connection with the literal coming of Christ and the literal scenes associated with that event. 2. They have been given literally in the past, and why may they not be given again literally? When the judgments of God were falling on the hardened Egyptians, the sun, moon, and stars, did not shine for three days; and when Christ hung upon the c:ross, the sun was darkened and the earth was robed in gloom, fitly prefiguring the sorrow a.nd misery awaiting those who receive not Christ as their Saviour. A star led the wise men to the infant Saviour at his first advent. How proper then to have these signs appear literally before the second coming of Christ and the ushering in of the day of wrath ! 3. John, in the subject of the seals, which was presented to him in A. D. 96. 26 years after the destruction of Jerusalem. represents the signs as to take place in close connection with the coming of Chzist and the day of wrath ; and the manner in which he describes the stars as falling" as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind"-answers completely to the manner in which the stars fell in 1833, proving conclusively the literality of the signs. Read also Joel 2: 30 ; Luke 21 : 25. The signs have been fulfilled literally at. the very time specified by the Saviour, immediately after the tribulo.tion of the elect. . 5. They made the very impression that such signs should make ; caused those who feared God to seriously consider, and wer&i
