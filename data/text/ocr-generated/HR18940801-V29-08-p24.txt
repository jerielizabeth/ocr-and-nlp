+W. THE DOUCHE, SPRAY, AND SHOWER BATHS. A DOUCHE is a volume of water thrown upon the body with more or less force, either from a height by atmospheric pressure or by a force pump. In a spray or a shower bath the volume of water is broken up into small streams by passing through a perfor-ated diaphragm of metal, hard rubber, or like material. The douche combines the usual remedial effects of the tonic bath with the stimulation resulting from the force with which the water strikes the body. All who have experienced the old-fashioned discipline administered by the slipper will remember it as an excellent warming appliance. So the force of the water on the surface assists in bringing about a reac-tion. A greater volume of blood is thus called to the surface, and by this method a marked tonic ef-fect is secured. Water of either a low or a very high temperature may be used. In either case the effect of the bath is more powerful if given intermittently and of different temperatures, as, for instance, changing from 65° or 70° to I to° or 112°, or even higher. When used locally, it has somewhat the effect of a massage, in exercising the skin 'and deeper tissue. The appliances required for a douche are a reser-voir for the water, placed at a suitable height, which is regulated by the amount of force desired. The force of the ordinary water faucet will usually be found sufficient, and may be utilized for this pur-pose by properly regulating the temperature of the water. Attach both the hot and cold water pipes to a single pipe, regulating the supply from each into the common pipe until the water running from the douche pipe is of the desired temperature. Or a large pail or tub may be filled with water and placed at a suitable height to give sufficient force to render the bath stimulating. In some cases a small force pump has been fitted into a tub, and the water projeCted against the body by this means. Attached to the vessel con- taming the water, must be a ruooer nose. In the case of a full douche to the whole body, this will need to be from six to eight feet long and from one to one and a half inches in diameter ; but for a local douche the ordinary half-or quarter-inch pipe will answer. To convert either into a spray, it is only necessary to screw a perforated funnel of metal or hard rubber into the end of the pipe. Or by placing the finger over the end of the tube, the operator may so regulate the action of the water as to produce a fine or coarse spray, as is desired. The shower bath is not used as often now as for-merly. It is an artificial rain produced by allowing water to fall from a perforated vessel placed above the body. A colander and a pitcher will make an efficient showering apparatus for family use; and a douching apparatus may be gotten up with six feet of half-inch rubber pipe and a twelve or sixteen quart tin pail, near the bottom of which is inserted a short spout as a place of attachment for the rubber tubing. If the spine is to be douched, the patient may sit in an. ordinary full-bath tub or on a low wooden stool in a washtub. The end of the tube should be held near the spine, and water of suitable temperature allowed to play constantly up and down the spine. Thus a stream of water may be directed upon whatever portion of the body is to be treated. To give hot and cold alternating, two pails and two tubes will be required, containing water of widely contrasting temperature, as 6o° or 70° for the cold and 1 to° or 115° for the hot. The spray bath may be given in the same way. A spray as fine as mist may be given by lowering the can and allowing the water to.pass through a very finely perforated funnel. By raising the vessel con-taining the water to a greater height, the force may be increased so as to give a tingling sensation, and thus produce the stinging effect of the needle bath, in ( 244)
