516 THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 4[VoL. 61, No. 33. But David grows impatient at the delay, and cries out : " 0 Lord God, to whom wen- geance belongeth; 0 God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. Lord, . . , how long shall the wicked triumph ? how long shall they utter and speak hard things, and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? They break in pieces thy people, 0 Lord, and afflict thine her- stage. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Ja- cob regard it. Understand, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? he that chastiseth the heathen, shall he not correct? he that teaeheth man knowledge, shall not he know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. . . . And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off." Ps. 94 : 1Š 11, 23. Peter says, " The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." 2 Pet. 2: 9. And Job says that "the wicked is reserved to the day of de- struction ; they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath." Job 21: 30. God has not delayed his judgment without a good cause. The infliction of the penalty is postponed till the true character of sin shall be developed. Sin has had a long march. In a few instances only has it been arrested; but it has again raised its hydra head, and become more impious than before. Darker deeds and still more dark are repeating themselves and know no bounds. The scoffer, ridiculing the God of the Bible, says, If he is such a good God as he represents himself to be, he would put an end to sin. He delights in crime or he would have stopped the lawlessness, the bloodshed, the wars, and the misery, long ago. He would not have suffered the devil to tempt man. He would have put an end to the devil in the be- ginning. But listen, 0 man, thou that repliest against God. God speaks to thee,0 wicked man : " What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldst take my covenant in thy mouth? seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. When thou saw- est a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue fram- eth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence." Ps. 50: 16-21. Had Satan been utterly destroyed when he first raised his arm in rebellion against God, then would all the remaining intelligences of reject the counsel of God against themselves ;‚. and with impunity they trample under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing; they have crucified the Lord of glory, and are still crucifying him afresh, and putting him to an open shame. With bold effrontery they have committed murder, theft, adultery, slander, Sabbath-break- ing, profanity, and insulted the Creator by making gods of their own to worship, saying in their hearts, There is no God but the gods we see, yet the Lord says, " These things hast thou done, and I kept silence." In doing this he has put to silence every murmuring thought, every censuring and complaining tongue. Will the long-suffering of God always keep him from pronouncing against crime? Justice demands that he shall not always keep silent. There is no hope of reform. "Satan is work- ing with all power and signs and lying won- ders, and with all deceivableness of unright- eousness, Evil men and seducers are waxing worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. That Wicked has vainly attempted to dethrone God, and is still exalting himself above all that is called God, saying in his heart, Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice? I know not the Lord. At this time the Lord speaks, "Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself. Ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stub- ble; your breath, as fire, shall devour you. And the people shall be as the burning of lime; as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire." Isa. 33: 10-12. " Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. Ps. 50: 21, 22. " The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jeal- ousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself : now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.' Isa. 42: 13, 14. God is not responsible for the existence of sin. It has come into his fair domain an in truder. It is an enemy to his government Yet God has patiently borne with it. While men have boasted, and defied the God of heaven, exalted and deified themselves, trodden down and persecuted his people, oppressed the poor and needy, hated God, and rejected and despised his word, the High and Holy One has kept still,Ša silence so painful that even wicked men have asked, Why is it so ? Yes, silently has God beheld the abominations com- mitted in the land. Long has he suffered and been grieved with insult upon insult. But why has he waited so long? That evil might be developed, and show its hideous form; that all his intelligences might see and understand its true character. Angel and man must be satis- fled that sin is deceptive, a delusion; that its pleasures are transient, its hopes vain, its prom- ises not realized; that its fruits, which appear so attractive to the eye, are only the seeds of bitterness, pain, and death. But a change must come. Sin's long march must end. God will not always keep silent. He will arise and put to silence the boasts of proud and haughty error, the ribaldry of the bold blasphemer, the jeering and scoffing. He will no longer suffer sin to mar the peace of his universe. He will make an example of sin's brief record. He will cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the "earth shall fear and be still." Dear reader, will you continue to sip at the fountain of sin, while its poisonous dregs are fast running out, filling up the cup of earth's iniq- uity? Will you for a morsel of its fruit sell your birthright? Repent Alice will soon be hid from thine eyes. Too late will soon be the bit- ter cry; for the harvest will be past, the sum- mer ended, and they are not saved. LOVE OF THE WORLD. BY MD. E. II. GATES.  " LovE not the world, neither the things that are in the world, . . . . For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eves, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but,is of the world." 1 John 2 : 15, 16. Notwithstanding the repeated declaration of the inspired writers that the friendship of the world is enmity with God, we are often pained to see professed Sabbath-keepers wearying themselves in their efforts to ape the fashions and customs of a pleasure-loving world. God- given time, which, if rightly improved, would secure to the possessor a starry crown, is often spent in decorating the body to gain the ad- miration of worldlings. Means which God has given to his servants to be returned b with usury, is given out with a lavish hand, without a murmur, for the gratification of ap- petite and the love of display. Many who have no time to spend in sending out tracts and papers laden with precious truth to the perishing millions, have no difficulty in finding whole days to devote to trimming and ruffling the apparel and plenty of time to attend par-ties of pleasure. Some who have no money to use for mission-ary work, or to support the cause, can find many dollars to pay for feathers to ornament the hats, gold rings for the fingers, and luxu- rious food to gratify perverted appetite. The following words are so truthful and of such solemn importance,m that I transcribe them for the benefit of our young Sabbath-keepers who are tempted to indulge in love of display :Š "I would remind youth who wear feathers upon their hats and ornament their persons, that because of our sins our Saviour's head wore the shameful crown of thorns. When you devote precious time to trimming your ap-arel, remember the King of Glory wore a plain, seamless coat. You who weary your- selves in decorating your persons, please bear in mind that Jesus was often weary from inces-sant toil and self-denial and self-sacrifice to bless the suffering and needy. He spent whole nightsin prayer upon the lonely mountain ; not because of his weakness and his necessities, but he saw, he felt, the weakness of your na-tures to resist the temptations of the enemy upon the very points where you are now over- come. He knew that you would be indifferent in regard to your dangers, and would not feel your need of prayer. It was on our account that hepoured out his prayers to his Father with strong cries and tears. It was to save us from the very pride and love of vanity and pleasure that we now indulge, which crowds out the love of Jesus, that caused those tears, and marred our Saviour's g visa -e with sorrow and anguish more than any of the sons of men."ŠTestimony, No. 24, pp. 68, 69. the universe have had occasion to say that he was dealt with harshly; his punishment was too severe; the Father was revengeful, and manifested a hasty, bitter spirit; if he had on- ly permitted the rebel angel to live, he would have seen the wrong he had done, and turned again to his allegiance. Had the Lord been hasty and arbitrary in his judgments, and ren- dered punishment instantaneously, putting an end to sin and the sinner at the commence- ment, then would have been raised the inde- fensible cry, Oh, what an unmerciful and un- just God! If he had only shown mercy, and had not dealt so arbitrarily with the sinner, he might have reformed. God would not give occasion for the least murmuring complaint, even a shadow for cen- sure to rest upon. Satan and his angels rebelled, and have for ages been waging a relentless war against God and his people, and still they live. Men, for six thousand years, have trampled under foot the authority of the Supreme Ruler, and have rebelled against his government. They have refused to hear the gracious call inviting them to come back; they --At I was riding along in the south of France one day, I saw a pair of fine birds over- head. The driver called out in the French tongue, " Eagles ! " Yes ; and there was a man . below with a gun, who was wishful to get a nearer acquaintance with the eagles; but they did not come down to oblige him, He pointed his rifle at them ; hut his shots did not reach half way, for the royal birds kept above. The higher air is the fit dominion for eagles. Up there is the eagle's play-ground, where he plays with the callow lightnings. Keep there eagles! Keep there! If men can get you within range, they mean no good to you. Keep up, Christians! Keep up in the higher regions, resting in Jesus Christ, and do not come down to find a perch for yourself among the trees of philosophy.ŠSpurgeon. --Good temper, like a sunny day, sheds a brightness over everything. It is the sweet-ener of toil and the soother of disquietude.
