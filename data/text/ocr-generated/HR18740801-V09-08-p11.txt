 THE HEALTH REFORMER. 235      <of sensations of smell with those of taste. There are, indeed, only four primitive and radical kinds of tasteŠacid, sweet, salt, and bitter. This may be shown by experiment. If we Łclose our nostrils on tasting any sapid substance, the perceived taste will come under one or other Łof these four heads. Thus, when the olfactory membrane is diseased, the savor of food is al-tered. How do odorous substances act with refer-ence to the matter which separates them from the organ of smelll Prevost, in 1799, showed that if an odorous body were put in a saucer full of water the emanations from it agitated the molecules of the water visibly. These mo-tions, of which camphor gives a very good ex-ample, have been recently studied by M. Lie-,geois. He found that some substances caused move-ments of gyration and translation over the water surface, similar to those of camphor. Of this class are benzoic acid, succinic acid, and orange bark. In the case of others, this motion .ceases very soon, as they become encased in an oily layer over their surface. He thinks these motions are due, not to a disengagement of gas, causing something like recoil, but to the separation and rapid diffusion :of the odorous particles in the water. The fluid shows affinity for these. Similarly, a drop of oil falling on water sends out an infinite number of very small globules, which spread through the liquid, while the volume of the drop is not sensibly diminished. So with aro-matic essences ; though insoluble in water, the small odorous particles tend to disperse them-selves in it. A small quantity of odorous powder will thus impart perfume to a large body of water. It is the same odorous molecules which are carried to our nostrils ; .and the action of water is thought, by M. Liegeois, to assist in the formation of them. In the morning, when the ground is moist, and the flowers are covered with dew-drops, there is a large exhalation of perfume. Similarly after a shower of rain. In gustation we have .something analogous : the saliva is fitted to diffuse the odorant principle ; by the motion of the tongue in the cavity of the mouth, this dif-fusion is promoted, for the surface of evapora-tion is enlarged. Now in the same way as the :small particles diffuse themselves in water do they diffuse themselves in air, which then be-comes the vehicle carrying them to our nostrils. Some odorous substances have a very great diffusibility. Ambergris, newly cast on the shore, is smelt a long way off: Bertholin states that the odor of rosemary off the Spanish coast is perceptible long before the land comes in :sight. The degree of division of the particles is in some cases marvelous. A grain of musk will perfume an apartment for a whole year,  without sensibly losing weight. Haller men- tions having kept for forty years some pieces of paper perfumed with a grain of ambergris, and at the end of that time they still retained their odor. It is to be noted that the odorous particles are sent out, and the body emitting them does not act as a center of agitation, giving rise to vibrations. It is thus a different case from those of light and heat. The odor is the odor-ous molecule itself ; whereas light, as perceived, is not the luminous body. We cannot tell whether oxygen has some chemical influence on the particles, nor what kind of action takes place on contact of the par-ticle with the nerve, whether a mechanical agi-tation or a chemical decomposition. But the distinction of the senses into physical (sight, touch, and hearing), and chemical (taste and smell), is a just one. In the latter, contact is always implied. The intensity and delicacy of the sense of smell vary in different individuals and races. In seine it is wonderfully sensitive. Woodwart tells of a woman who predicted storms several hours in advance from the sulphurous odor (due to ozone probably), which she perceived in the air. A young American, who was deaf, dumb, and blind, became a good botanist, simply by th e sense of smell. It is, however, in some of the lower animals that we find the sense most high-ly developed ; ruminants, pachydermous ani-mals, and, above all, carnivorous mammifers. Smell is, with some of them, like an eye, which sees objects, not only where they are, but where they have been. The keen scent of the dog is well known. Humboldt mentions that when, in his travels in South America, it was desired to attract condors, all they had to do was to slaughter an ox or a horse, and in a short time the odor at-tracted a number of these birds, though none were visible previously. Of birds, waders have the largest olfactory nerves, and their sense of smell is most highly developed. The olfactory organ in reptiles is large. Fishes also have an olfactory membrane ; and fishermen have observed that they are driven away when certain odorous substances are thrown into the water. Sharks and other voracious fishes often gather from great distan-ces when a carcass is thrown into the sea. Crustaceans are not insensible to emanations which come in contact with their olfactory fibers. Entomologists say that the sense of smell in insects is very subtle, but it is difficult to de-termine the seat of it. When meat is exposed in the air, flies soon appear in great numbers, though none were seen before. The carcasses of animals left on the ground attract hosts of in-sects, which find nourishment in them, and de-posit their eggs. This will often happen when the object is concealed, so that their search cin.not be guided by sight. Š.1f. Papillon.
