August 6, 1894. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. Pi 621 IN. a recent report of a tour of several churches in New York, published in the In-dicator, Elder S. H. Lane mentions meeting Brother G. D. Ballou, who was visiting friends at Pulaski, and incidentally states that he "gave a stirring and interesting discourse." Brother Ballou has been living for several years at Grant's Pass, Oregon, and was on his way to Gainesville, Ga., designing to settle there. BROTHER JOHN' VUILLEUMIER has been 'la-boring .it) the interest of the French population in and about Worcester, Mass., for some time, and reports that "a small beginning has been made." In view of the extensive,  work before.. us with the French-speaking people of the world, he suggests the importance of a French department in the South Lancaster Academy, to the end that more laborers he fitted for carrying- the message to that people. How great the harvest is, and how few the laborers! AT the recent camp meeting near Walla Walla, Wash., there were thirty-seven Scan-dinavians, and special services were held for them twice a day, in their own language. Others of their countrymen-from the city also attended their meetings. There- were also special services in the German language in a separate tent, the audiences numbering from seventy to eighty. The camp comprised in all 147 family tents, besides the tents for spe-cial purposes. The meeting is said to have been a very profitable one, and 100 persons were baptized. Ł THE Baltithore Herald of July 20 publishes a letter from Church Hill, Ind., to Elder John F. Jones, in which it is stated that a mid-night mob had endeavored to destroy the new Seventh-day Adventist house of worship at that place. When they had broken a few windows, however, they were frightened away by persons who heard the noise. A tent which was being used by Elder S. B. Horton was also considerably damaged. The mob assembledŁ at a little distance from the tent and indulged in abusive language and-threats of violence. Threats have been openly made that the church would be burned and the members tarred. HUMBOLDT COUNTY CAMP MEETING. THIS meeting has been appointed to be held in Eureka, from August 16-26. This time and place seem to suit the brethren of this section of the country as best. As there are but about two weeks until the beginning of the meeting, it will be neces-sary that orders for tents be sent at once. In order-ing your tents, state the size you want, with or without fly and carpet. The price of a 10x12 tent will be $4.00 and 12x16 tents $5.00. Fly and carpet extra. We trust that all our people throughout that section of the State will make special effort to be present. The stirring times in which we are liv-ing are evidence that we are fast approaching the end. We will not be able to hold many more camp meetings. Come, brethren, praying that God's Spirit may rest with power upon his people. Send tent orders to N. C. McClure, 1591 Telegraph Avenue, Oakland.

[NOTE.-The questions' which follow are merely suggestive for-the student on the leading points of the lesson ; it is presumed that the thorough student will think of many more as he studies the subject. References, where verses alone are given, always refer to the lesson scripture printed above. All other references are given in book, chapter, and verse. The text printed is that of the Revised Version, not because it is espe-cially preferred, but because it is not found in every family, as is the common version.] Lesson Scripture, John 1 : 35-49. 35. AGAIN on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples; 36. And he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Be-hold, the Lamb of God! 37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38. And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where abidest thou ? 39. He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode;  and they abode with him that day;  it was about the tenth hour. 40. One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simou Peter's brother. 41. He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). 42. He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John; thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation Peter). 43. On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip; and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. 44. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 45. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 46. And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 48. Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip ealled thee, when thou west under the fig free, I saw thee. 49. Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel. Golden Text: "We have found the Messias, which is, be-ing interpreted, the Christ." John I : 41. NOTE.-This lesson evidently comes immediately after the temptation of Jesus, on his return from the wilderness. He came back near to where John was baptizing. Just before this incident in the les-son, also, the Jews had sent a deputation to John to ask him who he was; and John had told them that, while he was not the Christ, he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness, and he was content to be that voice, the voice of God. So will every true . servant of God be content. He had also told them that.there was One coming after him whose shoes' latchet he was not worthy to unloose. The next day after this he saw Jesus, and said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" He declared that Jesus was the One to whom he had borne witness.
