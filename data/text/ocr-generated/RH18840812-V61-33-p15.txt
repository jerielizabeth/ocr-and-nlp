WILLoox. -Died at Flint, Mich., July 17, 1884, years, 8 months, and 1 day. On June 13 he had an attack of hemorrhage of the lungs, which increased in frequency and severity until about a week before his death. He had made no profession, but during his sickness often asked for some one to come in and pray and talk with him. At such times he talked quite freely, and seemed to derive much comfort thereby. He realised that he had been a great sinner, but felt that as he made confession and prayed for forgive- ness, God had heard ; and he had no fears of death.

After the organization of our people, Father Bates came into his neighborhood and formed a little church of which he then became a member. He has ever loved to welcome to his home any of like precious faith. Living in the city of Ann Arbor at the time that Prof. Brownsherger, then a young man attending the State University, embraced the truth, he took great interest in him, and did all he could to encourage him at the head of our denominational College at Battle in the faith, until he had the satisfaction of seeing him*10..00 below.
