" Wait a little, friend," he said, " Come and share my play." But the other did not pause. " I must work," said he,Š " Work until my task is done, And my mind is free." " Work will wait," quoth By-and-by ; " Sit down here with me. "I shall labor pretty soon, When this wreath is laced ; There is time enough for toil ; Why this foolish haste ? " Hurry-up said, walking on, " Time's too dear to waste." By-and-by saw Hurry-up Once again, they say,ŠSaw him sitting at his ease In the bright noon-day ; Blossoms grew about his feet, And his ait was gay. By-and-by, with brooding eyes, Looked out to the west, Hurrying down the dusty road, Anxious and depressed ; While beneath his nervous feet Faded flowers he pressed. Queer," he grumbled as he went Scowling on his way, " How luck favors Hurry-up ! Fate is queer, I say." And he does not understand " Such is pluck " alway. Š Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Gon does not forgive us unless we forgive others. Gon does not want any one to have charity for sin. TRIALS are to make us strong by showing us where we are weak. You can gage a man's religion by what he says about his neighbors. THE days are never too long for the man whose heart is in his work. PRAYER which does not come from the heart does not rise-above the head. IT is hard to convince some folks that a thing is wrong when they like to do it. Gon does not want leaves and flowers, but fruits of righteousness and true holiness. WE truly fear God when we conscientiously shun the very appearance of evil as well as all wrong. " SOMETIMES children think that Christians are only grown-up people: No, little one ; if you are old enough to understand that a Saviour died to save you, and you want to fol-low him, you, too, can be a little Christian." WHAT BOYS SHOULD KNOW. Six things a boy ought to know : Š That a quiet voice, courtesy, and kind acts are as essential in the world to the part of a gentleman as of a gentlewoman. That roughness, blustering, and even fool- hardiness are not manliness. The most firm and courageous men have always been the most gentle. That muscular strength is not health. That a brain crammed only with facts is not necessarily a wise one. That the labor impossible to the boy of fourteen will be easy to the man of twenty. The best capital for a boy is not money, but love of work, simple tastes, and a heart loyal to his friends and to his God.Š Selected. WHAT GOD GIVES A BOY. A BODY to live in and keep clean and healthy, and to be a dwelling for his mind and a temple for his soul. A pair of hands to use for himself and oth-ers, but never against others for himselfi A pair of feet to do errands of love and kindness and charity and business, but not to loiter in places of mischief or temptation or sin. A pair of lips to keep pure and unpolluted by tobacco or whisky, and to speak true, kind, brave words ; but not to make a smoke-stack or a swill trough. A pair of ears to hear the music of bird and tree and rill and human voice ; but not to give heed to what the Serpent says, or to what dis-honors God or his mother. A pair of eyes to see the beautiful, the good, and the true,Š God's finger-prints in flower and field and snow-flake ; but not to feast on unclean pictures, or the blotches which Satan daubs and calls pleasure. A mind to remember and reason and decide and store up wisdom and impart it to others, but not to be turned into a chip-basket or rubbish-heap for the chaff and the rubbish and sweepings of the world's stale wit. A soul as pure and spotless as a new-fallen snowflake, to receive impressions of good and to develop faculties, powers, and virtues which shall shape it day by day, as the artist's chisel shapes the stone, into the image and likeness of Jesus Christ.Š Morning Guide. JAPANESE CHRISTIANITY GOOD. REV. J. C. BALLACH, a missionary in Japan, recently visiting friends here, speaking of the character of the Christians in Japan, the spir-itual tone of their religious services, and the earnestness of their character, confessed to a feeling of great spiritual loss which he had ex-perienced in returning to this country. To use his own expression, it seemed to him as if he had entered into a tunnel whose darkness and chill were in sharp contrast to the sunlight and spiritual warmth to which he had been accustomed among the native Christians in Japan. The writer knows something of the " sun-light and warmth " of an experience-meeting in Japan, and has felt her own heart glow, as with eloquent gestures, shining faces, glisten-ing tears, native Christians have testified of the love of Jesus. One of the experiences, translated for us as spoken, was thrilling. A middle-aged man said that for years there had been a " something" in his soul that would not stop its cryŠ " 0, that I might find rest ! " that in search of it he had spent all his living in making long and weary pilgrimages ;  had visited a hundred shrines ; stood under as many fountains, thinking that his sins might thus be washed away. But all in vain Š there was no rest for his weary, seeking soul. " One day," he said, " as I was passing along the streets of Tokio, I heard a man Š a stranger man Šutter in my own language these words : Come unto Me, and I will give you rest.' " And he listened while the missionary told of the new way, spoke of the fountain opened up in the house of David for sin and uncleanness, where he might bathe, and find cleansing and peace. And in that far-away land I heard the old, old story ; he told it because he knew 't was true, and satisfied his longings as noth-ing else could do.Š Mrs. Chandler, in World-Wide Missions. HOW IS THIS, GIRLS ? Do you wear songbirds' feathers in your hats? If so, read this, and consider whether you want to encourage the bird-slaughter traffic : Š " It is estimated that about five million song birds are annually required to fill the demand for the ornamentation of the hats of American women. The slaughter is not confined to songbirds ; everything that wears feathers is a target for the bird-butcher. It is estimated that in a single season about forty thousand terns were killed at Cape Cod for exportation, and the swamps and marshes of Florida have been depopulated of their egrets and herons for the sole purpose of using their feathers in millinery. " The nine hundred and fifty women whom the Duchess of Portland has gathered into her Society for the Protection of Birds have pledged themselves never to wear the plumage of any songbirds."Š Exchange. " WHAT doest thou hereŠ here in this short life, here in this earnest world, here where thou hast one chance, and but one, forever ?" 19F-  WE are happy to be able to promise in a week or two to begin illustrated articles on our Sabbath-school lessons for the present quarter, from some of our best writers. It was not possible to make this arrangement before this, but we trust that the articles, coming as they will, after a thorough study of the subject of the Sanctuary and its service, will be read and appreciated all the more keenly, and prove all the more profitable to every one. THE FLORAL GUIDE. TEE Floral Guide, published by James Vick's Sons, of Rochester, N. Y., is again at hand, and as usual is a costly and handsome publication of great interest to all who love flowers or are interested in gardening. This annual catalogue is invariably one of the largest and most expensive publications of the kind in this country. The Guide costs ten cents by mail, but this price is de-ducted from the first order for seeds. THE February number of the Monthly Illustrator opens with specimens in large variety of the work of James Carroll Beckwith, an artist widely popular, who is not only an artist of power but has a very interesting personality. Foreign scenery, English cathedrals, sketches in Holland and Germany, increase the variety of travel-notes with which the number abounds. The " Lilies" and the " Flowers Narcissus " are also shown this month, along with scores of other drawings. Price (twelve numbers) three dollars a year ; fifty cents a copy. Harry C. Jones, editor and publisher, 92, 94, g6 Fifth Avenue, New York.
