228 GENERAL HYGIENE. advantage of a surprise-party leader, but in the first pitched battle was in his turn surprised by the mili-tary abilities of his young rival, who out-manoeuvred him at all points, captured his artillery train, and did not give him a moment's rest till he had hustled him back across the border hills. The would-be conqueror was glad to get off with-out loss of his own territories, but the simultaneous peace with Turkey did not suit the plans of the czar, who had secretly hoped to make a quarrel with the sultan an excuse for another raid on Constantinople. Besides, the internal policy of the prince elect was far too liberal to meet the approval of the Muscovite champions of despotism. Recriminations were fol-lowed by threats and the ugliest intrigues ; warnings were thrown away on the unsuspecting prince, who thought his former friend capable of brutal arro-gance, but not of downright treachery, till his eyes were opened by the explosion of the hidden mine. A number of Bulgarian army officers, corrupted by the lavish bribes of Russian agents, contrived in their turn to bribe the palace guards, and one night aroused their sovereign from his sleep and forced him into a closed carriage, which was kept galloping valley-ward. At the next river port it was met by the crew of a Russian steamer, who took charge of the prisoner, and with gratuitous excesses of per-sonal violence dragged him aboard and flung him into a dungeon-like rear cabin, where he was guarded like a captured highway robber ; requests for ex-planation being answered merely by Russian blas-phemies, till the captive was taken ashore near the Russian frontier and dismissed with the injunction to "beware, under penalty of worse consequences." There was no misunderstanding such arguments, and rather than wear his crown as the satrap of an Oriental despot, Prince Alexander renounced his throne, and with it the daydreams and ideals of his life. "All the best are doomed to come to an evil end," and the rule of a true nobleman over a noble nation could not be made to fit the political pro-gram of our latter-day world. A heroic struggle with adversity was once, supposed to invoke the aid of the gods, and it certainly often en-lists the sympathies of high-minded women. Prince Alexander's fiance, a princess of the imperial house of Prussia, hastened to assure the refugee of her undiminished affection, and the city of Berlin was all agog with the rumors of the impending nuptials. It was then that Chancellor Bismarck saw his chance for a home blow at the heart of a man he had never missed an opportunity to snub and thwart,Š the mag-nanimous Emperor Frederic, then struggling with the  crisis of life-endangering disease, and anxious to utilize his few remaining days for the benefit of the nation that had hailed his accession as the advent of a golden age, and would have parted with its fairest province to prolong his life by a single year. There is not a shadow of doubt that the end of that life was hastened by the vindictive arrogance of the man who made the possible (but by no means probable) interference of the czar a pretext for veto-ing the proposed marriage, and threatened his im-mediate resignation if the dying emperor should hesitate to enforce his veto or presume to compro-mise the matter in any way. Tortured by the ago-nized appeals of the princess on the one hand and the mastiff growls of the remorseless bully on the other, the emperor at last sacrificed his private inclinations, and with sore misgivings, signed a document which proved his own death warrant and ultimately that of the rejected lover. The official veto,Š " the meanest act ever pal-liated under the pretext of political expedience," as Premier Stambuloff had the courage to call it,Šwas ratified, and Prince Alexander retired to pass the rest of his life, or rather of a lingering death, in the solitude of the Styrian Alps. He still received visitors, accepted invitations to hunting parties or answered letters in a mechanical sort of a way, and even yielded to the advice of well-meaning friends by getting married ; but his soul was buried with the lost hopes of the past. He died, in the most literal sense, of a broken heart, grand projects of reform and half-ac-complished plans for the redemption of an earthly paradise, the pledges and Eden dreams of a pure loveŠ all sacrificed to the interests of a sordid despotism, and the peace of Nirvana remaining the. only refuge from the after-effects of a cureless wound ! Under the staggering effect of the Prussian outrage, Prince Alexander indeed felt at first as if his soul were on the point of departure for the land that had received the spirit of Kaiser Frederic ; and friends who saw him a few weeks after, thought he was look-ing twenty years older. The buoyancy of his step was gone, his appetite had failed entirely ; and to his intimate associates he made no secret of the fact that "life had lost its charms, and that the impending end could not come too won." The constitutional vigor inherited from a lineage of long-lived ancestors, deferred that hope for a few years ; but on the receipt of the last reports from faction-torn Bulgaria, the presentiment suddenly proved true; the wounded heart could bear no more Š no more. 0 Ł 4,
