THE SANITARIAN 1873.-Twenty-Second Year.-1894. THE SANITARIAN is a monthly magazine devoted to the promotion of the art and science of sanitation, mentally and physically, in all their relations ; by the investigation, presentation, and discussion of all subjects in this large domain, as related to personal and household hygiene, domicile, soil and climate, food and drink, mental and phys-ical culture, habit and exercise occupation, vital statistics, sanitary organizations and laws,-in short, everything promotive of, or in con-flict with, health, with the purpose of rendering sanitation a popular theme of study and universally practical. THE SANITARIAN is filled with articles of scientific interest and practical value. It would be difficult to plan a better professional maga-zine than this, which is to the medical world what the Scientific A me)i-can is to the artisan world. It deserves a greatly increased circulation. - Baltimore Methodist. THE SANITARIAN is not only an interesting magazine to the spe-cialist and the medical man, but xt is of high value to thickly settled communities, to homes, to general readers, to city authorities - indeed, we would place the journal, for public good, in the hands of every adult, believing that misery and suffering would thereby he lessened and hu-man happiness augmented by the knowledge the journal disseminates. -Sacramento Record-Union.
