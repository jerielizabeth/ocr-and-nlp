THE HEALTH REFORMER. 231 GENERAL ARTICLES. MAN. 'CAsr on the margin of the world he lies, A helpless babe, but by instinct he cries. He next essays to walk, but downward pressed, .0n four feet imitates his brother beast. By slow degrees, he gathers from the ground His legs, and to the rolling chair is bound ; 'Then walks alone; a horseman now become, He rides a stick, and travels round the room. In time he vaunts among his youthful peers ; ŁStrong-boned, and strung with nerves, in pride of years, He runs with mettle his first merry stage, Maintains the next abated of his rage, But manages his strength, and spares his age. Heavy the third, and stiff, he sinks apace, And though 't is downhill all, but creeps along the race. Now, sapless on the verge of death he stands, 'Contemplating his former feet and hands ; And, Milo like, his slackened sinews sees, And withered arms, once fit to cope with Hercules, Unable now to shake, much less to tear, the trees. ŠOvid. " Hygenic Mania." IN Good Tidings of July 1, 1874, Eld. 0. R. Fassett raises his toy trumpet to his mouth, and gives a blast on " Hygenic Mania," this .spelling being his own. We wonder if his ac-.quaintance with the hygienic system is indicat- Łed by his apparent acquaintance with the or-thography of this word. This would be the first impression, and this is strengthened by the way in which he treats his subject. He regards, he says, " the hygenic method of living . . . to be founded in ignorance and .superstition, detrimental to health and length of days, destructive to mental force and happi-ness."  Again he says :Š " The health and life of young and old in !households have thus been sacrificed, and many members of families have been hurried to pre-mature graves by this indiscretion ! And the Łcommunity suffers, and is imposed upon by weak, fanatical minds, made so by enfeebled kbodies, and the want of pure blood, which is 4  the life of the flesh,' and the invigorator of the brain." To sustain these sweeping assertions, he brings forward the case of a young lady, re-cently deceased. He says :Š " An afflicted father has besought me to make public the case of his own beloved daugh-ter, for the good of community, and the saving Łof others from becoming the victims to the in-fatuation of the system of diet advocated and enforced in some of our religious papers." Here, then, we look for a representative case .of those who, according to this writer, have  been " sacrificed " and " hurried to premature graves " by " the system of diet advocated and enforced in some of our religious papers." Let us look at a few of the particulars. The name of the young lady is given as Miss Mary Tryon, of Youngstown, N. Y. Her attending physician, Dr. Bartholf, was visited ; and from him it was learned that " she, as others, had become firmly persuaded for years that all articles of food, except a few, were injurious to her, and that they would cause her disease and distress if she partook of them ; and it was al-most impossible to make her eat those which were absolutely necessary to the continuance of her life. . . . This was true of meat, bread, potatoes, and of salt." The reader will mark these articles of diet. While there is some difference of opinion re-specting meat and salt, some admitting the oc-casional use of the former, and more of the lat-ter, we want to know what " system " has ever thrown out "bread and potatoes" from the list of things that might be eaten. Everybody knows that these are the very staples of every reformed system of diet. Was it then in obe-dience to any such " system of diet " that she refused to partake of these things By no means. It seems that a post-mortem examination was made which " showed the stomach perfectly sound, the liver also. The lungs indicated con-sumption, but not in an advanced stage, nor enough.to  cause death. Death was the result chiefly of inanition from emaciation and lack of nutrition. The perfectly healthy condition of the stomach, and of the liver as well, neg-atives the doctrine of disease then existing for which the invalid should resort to the absti-nence from food, or to scanty food for its cure. Consumption was developedŠthe result of pro-longed insufficiency of food for the system re-quirements." Now we have another question to ask : Is it any part of the hygienic system to advocate an insufficiency of food for all the wants of the body ? Yet this was the trouble with this young lady. Her death is attributed to the fact that she did not take a sufficient quantity of food to properly nourish her system. In this course was she following any system of diet advocated by any paper in the land I Just the reverse of it ; for everybody knows that hygien-ists advocate the use of the full amount of food that the system can properly appropriate. Less than this would be as much of an evil as more. The writer adds :Š " Mary, after being convinced, and admitting to her physician that the prescribed diet did not hurt but even benefited her, returned to her educated habits from conscientious and re-ligious scruples, and to-day lies in a premature grave," &c. This is a plain confession of morbid oonscien.-
