It commences in small things,Šthe neglect to be true to God and to rely upon him wholly, the disposition to concede to the demands of the world for the sake of gaining numbers on the church-book. But soon a wide gulf is opened between the position of the shepherd of the flock and the plain truths of the word of God. OurTHE only safety is in searching the Scriptures and in being much on our knees before God, entreating him to imbue us with his Spirit, that when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall for us lift up a standard against him. It is great kindness on the part of our heav- enly Father when he allows us to be placed under circumstances that lessen the attrac- tions of earth, and lead us to place our affec- tions on things above. Frequently, the loss of earthly blessings teaches us more than their possession. When we pass through trials and afflictions, it is no evidence that Jesus does not love and bless us. The pitying Lamb of God identifies his interest with that of his sufferino. ones. He guards them every moment. de is acquainted with every grief ; he knows ev- cry suggestion of Satan, every doubt that tortures the soul. He is touched with the feel- ing of our infirmities ; for he has experienced even more than we are passing through. He suffered, being tempted, that he might know how to succor those who are tempted, and thus bring many sons, and daughters to glory. And when we remember these things, the di- vine love touchingly appeals to our hearts. Jesus, our Advocate, is inviting us to walk with him. He is pleading the case of the tempted, the erring, and the faithless. He is striving to lift them into companionship with himself. It is his work to sanctify his people, to cleanse, enoble, and purify them, and fill their hearts with peace. He is thusdropped fitting them for glory, honor, and eternal life ; than that of any earthly prince. As children of God, members of the royalin family, we must cultivate disinterested love for one another. We must press together. We should guard the interests of our brethren, even though we may think they err. We are not perfect ourselves ; we are not immortal. Eli-thing,  jah was a mighty man of God ; yet he was " subject to like passions as we are." We must be tender, kind, and true to one another. " By this shall all men know that ye are my disci- pies," says Christ, " if ye have love one to another." Dear brethren and sisters, if we have the religion of Jesus in our hearts, it will be re- vealed in our lives. If we love Christ, we shall love one another. Let your life more than your lips, argue for your Saviour. It is by a well ordered life and godly conversation that you represent him to the world. P .. liti r.orttributorz. O., Mr. B. Š" Your question is a very natural one, my daughter, and suggested itself to my own mind when first I commenced the investigation of this subject. After much reflection I am sat-. isfied that God did not dwell in the tabernacle in the sense in which he is said to dwell in the temple in heaven ; i. e., by his bodily presence (if I may be allowed the expression), but sim-ply by a sort of spiritual presence, the visible token of which appeared in the shekinah which was visible between the cherubim. It was there that he met his people, and, through the high priest, communicated with them.

"ŠMai. 3 :M. CROSS OF CALVARY BY J. M. HOPKINS. LORD, I would linger near thy cross, Where smile thy love and peace on me ; And count earth's dearest treasures dross Compared with wealth I find in thee. The cross ! Yes, rugged though it be, Though friends forsake and foes deride ; ith grateful love I bow the knee W To him who here was crucified, Here bathes my weary, sin-sick soul In streams of purifying love ; While waves of glory o'er me roll, Borne from the Living Fount above. Blest boon of heaven ! In thee I find A Not all the powe of omb Can make a promise half so sure. B thee I'm raised above m woe y y , To view the shining glory-land ; By thee my fullest rapture know, Though thorns may pierce my head, my hand, Here will I rest in gladness still, Content whate'er my lot may be ; My wish to do God's holy will, My joy, the Cross of Calvary. Chatfield, Minn., . they wished to address him in prayer or other-wise, they either went to the tabernacle, or turned their faces in that direction ; thus show-ing that it was their conviction that it was the point where alone the spiritual presence of God was to be manifested. Nor is it necessary for the purpose of proving that the tabernacle was a type of the heavenly temple, to show that the former was actually and constantly the sometimes but a crude representation of its anti- type. We have already seen that God dwells personally in the temple in heaven, and allŁ that is required in this particular, so far as the tabernacle is concerned, in order to prove that it was a type of the heavenly temple, is to show that it contained something to represent the presence of Jehovah therein. That we have already found in the shekinah, or visible glory, that appeared between the cherubim. Is this point clear to your mind, Mr. Thought-ful ? " Mr. Thoughtful.Š" Yes, sir ; quite so." Mr. B.Š" Then I will pass to another text. Here is one in Ex. 25 : 8, 9 : ' And let them make me a sanctuary ; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. Here, again, in verse 40, another important testimony : ' And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.' Perhaps I had better read two other texts before commenting upon those already read. The first you will find in Acts 7 : 44 : ' Our fathers had the tab-ernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.' The second text is located in Heb. 8 : 4, 5 : ' For if he were on earth he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law, who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.' Do you see the bearing of these texts, Maud, , upon the subject ? " Maud.Š" I cannot say that I do, father." Mr. B.Š" Do you, Mr. Thoughtful ? " Mr. T.Š" Not fully, sir. There are just two points that these passages seem to estab-lish : The first is, that the Lord commanded Moses to build the tabernacle according to the pattern shown to him by the Lord in Mount Sinai ; the second is, that Moses did that which he was commanded to do." Mr. B.Š" Precisely so, Mr. Thoughtful ; those are the very points that I wish to prove by them. Now if I can show that the pattern shown to Moses in the Mount, and according to which he made the tabernacle, was a pattern of the heavenly sanctuary or temple, then I shall have made out my case, shall I not ? " Mr. T.Š" Yes, sir; for in so doing you will prove that the tabernacle was a type, or repre-sentation, of the heavenly temple ; the very thing that is claimed in your second thesis." Mr. B.Š" Do you grasp the point, Maud." Maud.Š" Yes ,sir, and I am waiting to see whether you can make the necessary proof." Mr. B.Š" Very good ; then I will proceed to my task. I read Heb. 9 : 22, 23: `And almost THE TEMPLE IN HEAVEN, AN IMAGINARY CONVERSATION ON A VERY nu- PORTANT THEME. BY MD W. H. LITTLEJOHN. for an inheritance richer and more lastingis MR. BIBMST.Š" As all are present, we will resume the discussion at the point where we it at our last interview. Let mesee ; I think we were about to examine the thesis which states that the `tabernacle of Moses and the temple of Solomon were types of the temple Heaven.' Yes, I am right. We had not en - tered upon the discussion of the thesis ; but Maud had explained the term ' type' as used therein, defining it to be anything that is em- ployed to represent or symbolize some other the paschal lamb' ' , whic as for example  was a type of Christ. The antitype, she told us, is that which is symbolized by the type. In the light of that explanation I am to prove to night that the tabernacle of Moses and the temple of Solomon, which, practically, were the same thing, were representations or shadows of the temple in heaven. The first text that I shall employ for this purpose will be found in Ex. 25 : 1-8. I read, `And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. And this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. And let them make me a sanctuary ; that I may dwell among them.'" Maud.Š" Father, what is the meaning of the word ' sanctuary ' ? " Mr. B.Š" If you will observe the passage closely, my daughter, you will see that it an- swers your question quite satisfactorily. Here are the words to which I refer : ' Let them build me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them.' From this language you readily dis- cover that the sanctuary was built that the Lord might dwell therein ; in other words, the sanctuary was a dwelling-place for God." Maud.Š" You don't mean to say, father, that God really dwelt in the tabernacle built by Moses ?" ŠGod does not bid us succeed in what we undertake, but to do our best to win success. Often he is careful not to allow us to succeed, Therefore, when we know 'that we hon- estly have done our utmost in any case to en- lighten the judgment, to employ the necessary energy and perseverance, and to possess and exhibit a Christ-like temper and manner, then we are not to be disheartened if we do not ap- pear to have accomplished much. The fruit of our service may be invisible to the men and women around us, but Christ sees and harvests it. We may have succeeded in his sense of the word, when we are inclined to grieve over a supposed failure. Is there not comfort in the thought ? ŠThere are depths of love in Christ beyond what we have seen; therefore dig deep, and la- bor, and take pains for him, and set by as much time in the day for him as you can. He will be won with labor.ŠRutherford.
