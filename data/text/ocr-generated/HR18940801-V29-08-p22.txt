242 HOME CULTURE. A BOY'S IDEAL MAN.Š While a guest at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, Dr. A. N. Tracy, a temperance evangelist from Chicago, said in the course of a short address in the parlors one day : " There is no one present but is fashioning the future of some boy, and you are, to a degree, responsible for the future of that child. You may be inclined to disbelieve this ; but I ask you to recall your own boyhood days, and see if you did not pick out some one as your ideal man, and if that man had not more influence over your life than any other. Suppose a boy hears his ideal man say that 'the man who cannot take a drink of liquor or let it alone, is no man.' He begins to think that it is manly to drink ; he cherishes the thought, and it grows with his growth; and the chances are that by the time he is able to ' chin a counter,' he is ready to take his first drink at a bar. There is no more specious sentiment than this, nor one which has directly made more drunkards." HERE are some points for mothers in the manage-ment of their children, which if carefully studied and followed out, would solve very nearly all the puzzling problems with which mothers so often find them-selves perplexed : Study 1. to understand your chil-dren ; 2. to feel with them ; 3. to bear with them ; 4. to make them happy and useful ; 5. to lead them by love ; 6. to punish as rarely as possible, and when it must be done, to think a long time how best to do it. UNTRUTHFUL CHILDREN.Š Some one asked Miss Harrison, the superintendent of the Kindergarten College in Chicago, what she would do with a child who told lies. She said : " It would depend entirely upon the sort of lie it was." Her advice in sub-stance was like this : Š Lying is too often treated locally, when it should be constitutionally treated. There are almost as many different sorts of lies as there are different sorts of fevers. For example, exaggeration which comes from excess of imagination is to be cured by teaching accuracy of observation. Make the child count all the objects in the room. Make him hold steadily to proven facts in everything. Then there is the lie of egotism, which is always claiming everything for itself. Ignore the story. Make it seem not worth his while. The lie which denies is the fault of other people. Punishment has been given arbitrarily. That is to be corrected in the guardian. The hardest fault to correct in a child, or in any  one else, is the deep lie of jealousy, the malicious lie. It always comes from jealousy, and there seems to be only one possible remedy. Get the jealous child to do some service for the other. Make him participate in the other's life,Š in some way become a partner,Š as it were, and the jealousy ceases.Š Ex. GUARD WELL YOUR BOYS.Š"You can't keep boys quite straight, you know. They must have a chance to sow their wild oats." Must ? A word from Satan's vocabulary ! Look ahead a few years. There he goesŠ a young boy ! swearing, swaggering, coarse, obscene ! You hope he will marry and settle down ? Yes, if some pure girl will pour the fullness of her sweet life into the turbid stream of his, there is a bare chance that he may be saved. How much better to have trained him to the right when you had him under your hands ! In the outset he was not unlike his sister in morals. You hold her to the proprieties and decencies, while you let him run at his own will in paths of evil. Now in purity of life they are leagues apart. There are as many boys as there are girls in infant classes in our Sabbath-schools; but one-half as many boys as girls in the Bible classes. Women outnumber men in the church, two to one. In the State prison, men outnumber women fifty to one. This tells its own story !  ŠSel. A THOUGHTFUL PROVISION.ŠTo the German em- ) peror is ascribed a thoughtful provision for servant girls, which was put in force two years ago. Every maid servant, it seems, is provided with a stamp book. In this book every week a three-cent stamp bought from the government is pasted by her mis-tress. This is, on her part, the tax which she pays the government presumably as her license to keep a servant. The benefit accrues to the girl ; for, should she be ill, the stamps will be redeemed by the government for her support ; otherwise the stamps are kept, and become a fund for her in old age. WHAT a young man earns in the daytime goes into his pocket, but what he spends in the evening 'goes into his character.Š Sel. Child Š" Grandpa, how old are you ?" GrandpaŠ" I am eighty-seven years old, my little dear." Child Š" Then you were born eighty years before I was ?" Grandpa Š" Yes, my dear little girl." ChildŠ" What a long, long time you had alone,,  waiting for me." 11h w Ł
