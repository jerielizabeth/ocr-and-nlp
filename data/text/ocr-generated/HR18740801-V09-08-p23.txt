THE. HEALTH REFORMER. 247 Necessity of Carefulness in Old Age. Ax old man is like an old wagon. With light loading and careful usage, it will last for years Ł but one heavy load or sudden strain will break it and ruin it forever. Many peo-ple reach the age of fifty, sixty, or even seven-ty, measurably free from most of the pains and infirmities of age, cheery in heart, and sound in health, ripe in wisdom and experience, with sympathies mellowed by age, and with reason-able prospects and opportunities for continued usefulness in the world for a considerable time. Let such persons be thankful, but let them al-so be careful. An old constitution is like an old boneŠbroken with ease, mended with dif-ficulty. A young tree bends to the gale, an old one snaps and falls before the blast. A single hard lift ; an hour of heating work ; an evening of ex-posure to rain or damp ; a severe chill ; an ex-cess of food ; the unusual indulgence of any appetite or passion ' Ł a sudden fit of anger ; a dose of powerful medicineŠany of these, or other similar things, may cut off a valuable life in an hour, and leave the fair hopes of use-fulness and enjoyment but a shapeless wreck. ŠSel. SCHOOL-HOUSE VENTILATION.ŠThere is little hope that school buildings will be so construct-ed as to secure abundant ventilation. Still, I would hold up the ideal, which must become real before our schools shall meet the demands of the age. A writer has well said that when the proper and fitting thing to be done is once clearly pointed out, it generally contrives to get itself done in the long run. A proper temperature as the first condition of mentaL activity, and the removal of carbonic acid, which " lowers the vitality and kills with indef-inite warning," are prime conditions for the development of a nation that is yet to rule the world. We have abolished the choki g of our worst criminals by the hangman's rope ; let us abolish the strangling of the innocent children by viewless ropes of poisoned air.ŠR. C. Ked-zie, M. D. METHOD OF TALKING.ŠTalk often in com-pany and in a way which shows that you un-derstand what is said around you. But do not talk long. In that case you are apt to tire your hearers. There are many persons who, though they have nothing to talk of, never know when to stop talking. There are some who labor under so great and insatiable a de-sire for talking that they will even interrupt others when about to speak. We should in society never talk of our own or others, domes-tic affairs. Yours are of no interest to them, and theirs should not be to you. Besides, the subject is of so delicate a nature that with the  best intentions it is a chance if we do not make some mortifying mistake, or wound the feelings of some of the company. Medical Hints. THE less that simple cuts, bruises, and burns, are meddled with the better. If they are kept clean and excluded from the air, nature will take care of the healing process. The salves and lotions so commonly used are generally ir-ritating rather than beneficial, and hinder rath-er than hasten the cure. For cuts, a little court-plaster to keep the edges of the skin to-gether ; for bruises, wet cloths ; for burns, a covering of dry wheaten flour, are usually he only treatment, and the very best that can be used. If, from an unhealthy state of the body, or from external irritation, inflammation is pro-duced, something more may be required, the remedy varying with the special case. PAULINE HENRI, in the Liberal Christian, concludes an excellent article on " Woman's Dress Reform " with the following pithy words :Š " Alas ! my sisters, with absurdities on our heads, bunches on our bodies, trains and demi-trains dragging behind usŠburdens all, which Nature never intended to impose upon usŠwhat wonder that we do not many mighty works ! Wherefore, dear friends, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of drapery, let us resolve to lay aside every weight that impedes our highest usefulness, and the sin of fashionable display that cloth so easily beset our sex." BE CHEERFUL.Š" Be cheerful," says the man who is easy in his circumstances, missing no loved face at the table, nor by the hearth. But does he ever consider how hard it may be to be cheerful when the heart aches, and the cup-board is empty, and there are little fresh, green graves in the churchyard, and friends are few and indifferent, and even God, for the time being, seems to have forgotten us, so desolate is our lot ! How difficult for one man to un-derstand another in such different circum-stances. How easy to say, " Be cheerful !" How hard he would find it to practice, were he stripped of all life's brightness ! THREE-FOURTHS of the difficulties and miser-ies of men come from the fact that most want wealth without earning it, fame without de-serving it, popularity without temperance, re-spect without virtue, and happiness without holiness.
