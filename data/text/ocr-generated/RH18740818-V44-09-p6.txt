70 ADVENT REVIEW AND HERALD OF THE SABBATH. Vol. 44, No. 9. GO WORK. Go work for the Saviour, He's done much for you ; And to work is a favor \Yhen we've something to do. And life brings the chances All through the bright day: If our eye only glances Both sides of the way. There's a heart full of sadness From hope long deferred ; Joy brings it no gladness; Oh ! speak a kind word. Here's a little one weary From walking the while, Life's journey seems dreary, Oh! give it a smile, Then the poor little stranger Whom God has bid come, You may shield it from danger And give it a home. There are thorns in the highway presses the throng : (:}o clear the rough pathway; Strew roses along. And work for the Saviour, He's done umch for you: And to work is a favor When we've something to do. -Advocate and Gtt(tnlian. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubt IMS come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. = San Jose, California. JIONDAY, Aug. 3, we took down our tent after a stay here of five weeks, during which time we held meetings continually, with the ception of one night. The interest was not large at any time. Two hundred and fifty, and three hundred, were the largest congregations we had. We had about one hundred quite ular hearers, and seldom less than sixty. We have had two Sabbath meetings-very good ones. Several took a part, expressing themselves as very thankful for the truth. Twenty-three have embraced the Sabbath. We sold $20 worth of books, and obtained fifteen names for the Signs. We have hired a ha.lJ, and raised sufficient means to pay for it. We "hall have regular meetings on the Sabbath, and prayer-meetings Tuesday nights. I shall spend much of my time here for a week or two yet, deavoring to get them in as good condition as possible before we leave this section of the coun· try. Eld . .Miles Grant had lectured here at several different times previous to our coming. At first he had quite a hearing, but the people !'loon lost interest in him, so that when he was here the la.st time this spring he quit for lack of an audience. Indeed, his efforts here were an tire failure. Yet, laboring under many vantages which he did not have, a small church has now been raised up here, by the blessing of the Lord and the power of his truth. Those who have come out say that they never saw such harmony in the Bible, such clearness of the truth, and such power in the simple word of the I..ord, as they now see. For insta.nce, those who had for scores of years strongly opposed immersion, and have been thoroughly settled in the doctrine of sprinkling for baptism, say that they thought they never could be changed. But now, after hearing only one sermon upon that subject, they immediately give up their error readily adopt the truth. And so on other po10ts. We have pitched our tent at Santa Clara, a city of three thousand inhabitants, only three miles from San Jose. We do not design to stay there over two weeks, not expecting much terest. We did it. in order to complete the work here and present the Sabbath truth there. The more I have a chance to become quainted with the first-day Adventists, and the utter confusion, division, and wrangling there is among them, the more I am impressed with the fact that we do not appreciate the unity and mony which characterize our own work. Their divisions and the unsettled positions upon which they are constantly changing, show that they are off from the track of truth somewhere. We think we know just where it is and just what they need, namely, the third angel's with the commandments of 0-od and the spmt of prophecy. Brethren, the Lord is giving the field, and giving glorious victories to his trnth. We pose to buckle on the armor and press home the battle. Pray for us. D. CANRIGIIT. Among the Swedes. more than c11n be numbered.'' Ps. :40:4, 5. The above although spoken by a king of Israel, are the very word:! I would use to_ press the feelings of my heart, when I consider the favor which God brstowed upon me and many of my countrymen within the past few years. We have seen the works of God derfully displayed among us in leading sinners from error to truth; and, in the midst of fusion and moral darkness, we have experienced the quieting and refreshing. Spirit of God to lead us on in the light of his glorious word. Again I have made a round visit to my ren and been greatly encouraged in finding their faith !'ltronger and their hopes brighter. Our meetings have been more solemn than ever fore, and the tender Spirit of God has moved deeply on the hearts and feelings of the people. Eleven more have been added to our number, seven of them t1y baptism. At present I can do but little in carrjing God's truth to my fellow-men on account of the busy season. Will start out with a tent in a few weeks. Several young men desire to go with me. l\Iay God help them to be usef"ul. My address will continue to be Litchfield, l\Ieeker Co., l\f inn. Cu ARLES LEE. CLOSED our meetings in Wahoo last evening. We leave a few here who have taken a firm stand· in favor of the Sabbath of the Lord. Others acknowledge the truth, but are in the "valley of decision" in reference to yielding obedience to the commandments of God. We move from here to :Fremont where there is quite an element of Danes and Norwegians. We earnestly request Bro. Hansnn, of this Conference, if consistent with other duties, to meet us there immediately, to preach to them in their own language at such times as the tent is unoccupied. This request is sanctioned by the president of our Conference. We take this means of it public, as we do not know his address. If Bro. Hanson cannot meet us at once, will he please write td us? Our address is Fremont, Dodge Co , Neb. Brethren pray for us. CHAS. L. BoYD, R. A. HART. Wahoo, Saunders Co., Neb., Aug. 13,1874. Nelv York & Pennsylvania. SINCE my last report, have labored in a place called Steam Valley, in Cattaraugus Co. Spoke to a few eight times. There w11s some intercs" apparent, but none were fully decided. Visited the friends again at Com£s Creek, Pa.. Three are decided on the truth, and others are favorable. Have just had a meeting of interest at Corydon, Pa. Baptized four, and partially organized a church of seven. Another would have joined, but is so feebl-3 in health as to be unable to attend the meetings. The L')rd bless the willing, and accept of' their willingness. A good attendance and interest from without on first-day, and a quiet and solemn b11ptismal scene. It. F. CoTTREJ.L. Aug. 10, 187.1;.

E. house at this place. We intend to move to a new field next week. Brethren, pray that the Lord may continue to bless our labors. J. M C W ILLIA!\IS. 1\-[isso·uri Valley, Iowa, A1tg. 6, 187-'f. Marlow, N. H. SrNCE our last report, our audiences have increased and retained an average of about one hundred and twenty-five. We have not yet :finished the Sabbath question. ready many are convinced ofits claims upon them, ancl some have decided to obey even at a great Joss to them, being thrown out of occupation. The ministers are quiet on the surface. '\Vc have the ears of a good class of intelligent people, and our prayer is that God may work upon the heart. He has helped in speaking his truth. We have our first Sabbath meeting next Sabbath. Oh ! may God meet with ua and give the Spirit's power. ·'BLESSED is that man that maketh the Lord biB trust, and respecteth not the proud1 nor such turn aside to lies. l\lany, 0 Lord my Ged, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, thy thoughts which are to as-wa.rd: cannot be reokoned up in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are I would say a word to those who are boring in the different tents in the wide field, that we have at last overcome a long known difficulty, i. e., we have our tent seated with backs to nearly all of the seats, and we find that these are first filled, and we often hear the remark from the ladies, "I could not oome if it were not for these backs." It is merely a simple arrangement consisting of two boards, twelve inches wide each, one for the seat, the other for the back, and held in position by two or three pieces of hoop iron, each cut two feet long with a screw hole in each end, fastened with screws to the back, one inch:.from the top on the back side, and brought over and fastened to the lower side of the seat, one or more inches from the front. By this arrangement, two of as were about thirty minutes seating our tent, and they are as permanent to-day as they were when pŁlt up three weeks ago; wh?le did not cost one dollar. By usmg a little genuity, they are very easily made. R. M. KILGORE. July 30, 187-f. Wisconsin. '\VE have just closed a series of meetings at Neilsville, Clark Co. It is a village of about one thousand inhabitants, situated in the midst of a lumber region. Our meetings commenced rather discouragingly. The ple seemed to ?are but very l.ittle abo.ut the Bible or anytbmg that pertamed to 1t, and we began to feel that our effort would be in vain. But gradually the interest began to increase and continued to do so until the close of: the meetings. The whole town is now stirred up. Investigation is going on in the streets and in all places of business. As nearly as we can ascertain, five have decided to obey the whole truth, and quite a number more are investigating, who probably will embrace it. Since. our camp-meeting, we have visited Nasonville, and held four meetings. Four commenced to keep the Sabbath. Last Sabbath, we had a general meeting of the brethren and sisters of Clark Co. About fifty came together. It was a good day for us. The Lord gave us his precious blessing, and many hearts :vere made to joice in hope of eternal hfe. We feel to thank the Lord and humble ourselves before him in view of his blessing which we have realized during this meeting. We pitch our tent this week at Leon, Monroe Co. H. w.

Sold seven dollars' worth of books and obtained seven names for the REVIEW on trial. The tent is now pitched in Rockford, ten miles north of 1\larble Rock. We have commenced meetings here with a fair tion of candid hearers. Our address is Rockford, Floyd Co., Iowa. C. A. WASHBURN, E. w. FARNSWORTH, MINOS MILLER.. Jesuits, and Papal Orders. TnE Jesuits are the nerve of the holy see of Rome, and they hold a commission izing them to destroy every power that makes any pretensions to self-government. They have been driven from Germany, Italy, tria and Spain, and they come to England and America. In England, they have ated a disturbance by introducing, stealthily, confessionals into the high or established Church of England. In America, their great plea is against, and they are trying to break down, the pulio schools and other signs of progress. The Guardian, the Catholic organ of San Francisco, says: "It is certain that Catholics generally are but little concerned as to how our public schools are managed, for it is torious that the best and most thorough cational institutions in the country are those managed by Catholics. No-it is not so much the management of the godless schools, with which Catholics :find fault, as in being compelled to contribute to the support of a system of education, which, when not del, is avowedly Protestant." One thing is a little singular. If they do not care how the schools are managed, why have they worked in such a manner as to troduce a large majority of Catholic teachers into the public schools of San Francisco? The Tablet, another Catholic paper, in its issue of Nov. 13, 1869, said, "The State must either not tax us at all, or give us our proportion of the money raised to be pended in schools under the control of t.he church." The same paper in its issue of December 25 of the same year, says: " \Ve demand of State, as our right, either such schools as the church will accept, or exemption from the school tax. If it will support schools by a general tax, we de_mand that it or give us our proportion of the pubhc funds, and leave us to provide schools in which we can educate our children in our own religion, under the supervision of our own church." The Freeman's Journal of Nov. 13, 1860, another Catholic paper, says, "Education not the work of the State at all. It belongs to families, and should be left to families and to voluntary associationf'. The school tax is in itself an unjust imposition." The same journal ior December 11, of the same year, says, "Let the public school tem go to where it came from-the devil." Talk of the above kind induced the Ne\v York Legislature to accede to their claims, and a. committee was selected to appropriate the school funds. The committee being largely Catholic, the case came out worse than that of the famous robber who was viding the money with two of his ignorant fellow-thieves, "There's two for you two, and here's two for me too." In this case it was, "There's $1.00 for your Protestant schools and here's $15.00 for our Catholic schools." Shortly after this triumph on the part of the Catholics, a meeting of Roman Catholics was held in New York. In the meeting, one of the speakers, exulting over what had been gained by them through cial appropriations from the New York islature, said, "This is the little finger, and we must persevere till we get the whole band."* Papists discard Protestant schools, and claim that their plan of educating is the best. Cardinal Wiseman, in a lecture delivered at Leeds, England, says : "Sciences, letters, and arts, never flourished more than the papacy; the church of Home is really the mother of all wisdom." Again, he says: "Italy is the first country in Europe for great genius; but Italy is the center of the papacy; therefore the dominance of the pope is the producer of great genius in sciences, letterR and arts." On this, Gavazzi says: "She produces great geniuses, not by the rule of the pope, but by her sun and soil ; not by the Romish domination, but in spite of it, Yes, in spite of it! Rome, without was unequaled for her monuments-the popes destroyed them. Home of the popes can show nothing to compare with Rome of the pagans." "She did not need a pope to produce Cicero, Horace, Livy, Pliny, Tacitus, Virgil, Tibulus, Seneca, and the long list of her lustrious pagan names. Her genius not from the Vatican, but from herself." "Cardinal Wiseman says the popes courage genius, and ventures to cite Dante, Petrarch, Boccacio, and even Gallileo ! . . 
. . 
Dante was persecuted ; his works were forbidden till about two centuries .a go; to this day the Jesuits expel them from their schools. . . . 
Ł Our best historians, from Guicciardini to Charles Botta, were all bidden. The best authors on the ment of laws and political economy, as Filangeri, Beccaria, Giannone, Gioia, magnosi, were all forbidden. Gallileo, in spite of all the assertions of Wiseman, was imprisoned, persecuted, and morally soned by the inquisition. . Ł Ł . From the days of Gregory the seventh to the present, Italy has produced great geniuses; all have been persecuted. The conclusion is clear ; they have been neither created nor fostered by the papacy; but have been the sons of Italy, her natural productions, who have grown to a greatness that will endure er in spite of popes and popery." f Father Damen, the .Jesuit, in his lecture in London, Canada., Feb. 21, 1870, made a ment that "the church of Rome is not opposed to education or to free institutions." Brock, in his reply, says, "A few years ago, the flresent pope issued an allocution in ret'erence to the affairs of the republic of New Granada in this continent, in which he says, "Nor must we pass over in silence that, by the new constitution of that Republic, enacted in these recerit times, among other thing11, the right of free education is defended, and liberty of all kinds is given to all, so that each person ma:IJ even print and publish thoughts, and all kinds of monstrous portents of opinions, and profess privately and puUicl,!J whatever worship he pleases." On this the pope observes to the College of Cardinals whom be addressed," You assuredly see, venerable· brothers, how horrible and sacrilegious a war is proclaimed against theCat.bolic chureh, by the rulers of the Republic of New nada."t Damen further states: "The Jesuit turer then went on to dwell in glowing guage ·on the patronage extended to the tine arts, by the church of Rome. Printing and sculpture, music and architecture, where would they be but for the fostering care of Rome? I acknowledge that the church of Rome encouraged these arts, but it was only to serve her own ends. Pressed into her service, they ministered to her idolatry, and surrounded it with that which fascinated the eye and pleased the ear. The idolatrous sacrifice of the mass, celebrated in a gorgeous cathedral, amid the trophies of painting and sculpture, and accompanied by ravishing strains of music, would invest the Roman service with charms which to some minds would be irresistible. Rome's patronage of the fine arts, then, has not been disinterest•d. They have materially aided her in leading captive the minds of men. Yet think not that to Rome alone belong those who have excelled in art.
