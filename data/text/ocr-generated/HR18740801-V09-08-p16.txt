 X40 THE HEALTH REFORMER.    with mercuryŠwho believed that, in at least half the known diseases, salivation and salva-tion were synonymous termsŠthese men were Jenner and his contemporariesŠmen undoubt-edly of careful observation, sound judgment, and great skill. For aught that we know, they were just as much respected by their patients, just as successful, as the modern iEsculapius, who says they were unmistakably and seriously in error. Patients recovered under their treat-ment, as patients recover under that of later physicians, who assume to possess the true Koran, and be its only interpreters. Thirty years ago, a patient would be bled in disease where now it would be considered egregious malpractice ; but the patient bled and the pa-tient unbled alike recover, or alike die. One fact in the history of medicine might well stagger the faith of the most confident be-liever in the virtue of drugs : It is the co-exist-ence of two systems of practice, professedly antagonistic, each denouncing the other as ab-solutely ineffective or positively harmful, yet both Ł apparently flourishing, both having en-thusiastic and intelligent advocates. At a time when human blood was flowing in streams both large and small, not from the sword, but from the lancetŠwhen men believed that their tem-poral salvation depended on their being scari-fied, cupped, leached, and venesectedŠan im-pudent Teuton, Hahnemann by name, broached the insane idea that patients could recover with less bloodshed, or even with none at all ; and, strange to relate, they did so recover with un-mutilated integuments, and, so far as human eyesight could determine, just as well unscari-fied as the reverse. At a time when no fact was better established in medicine than that in certain cases blisters must be applied to the shaven scalp, and to the " spine of the back," and to the calves of the legs, this same German said to his tender-skinned followers, " Do not blister," and they persisted in recovering with-out blisters, but in direct violation of the or-thodox rules of practice. Moreover, when hundreds and thousands were standing, hours at a time, spoon in hand, contemplating with rueful countenances the nauseous contents, and hesitating to make the dreaded plunge which should deposit the dose in its uncertain resting-place, the Hahnemann before-mentioned was tickling the palates of his patients with sugar pellets, and facetiously insisting that they were taking medicine. Some of them believed him, and from some inexplicable cause would recover from their ailments quite as frequently as un-der the old regime. This wonderful burlesque on the practice which had been adopted, wheth-er it has added anything useful to the pharma-zopceia or not, has at least added a horn to a dilemma. Either the ridiculously mild meas-ures and small doses were useful and effective Šwhich we must be pardoned for saying we do not for a moment believeŠor the ridicu-lously large and filthy doses and severe treat-ment, which had previously been in vogue, were useless, which we just as firmly believe. The inference is a fair one, even if it has not been absolutely demonstrated, that the virtus of drugs and their efficacy in healing disease had been over-estimated, and that recoveries had been ascribed to the action of medicine which were due to an entirely different cause. Assuming that there is evidence that drugs have received more credit than they deserve, the serious question arises in the mind of the medical Othello, whether his occupation is not, in a great measure, gone. Not at all. It is to be feared, however, that he has mistaken, not his calling, but the nature of the duties re-quired of him. Perhaps it would be well for him to consider himself a doctor, and not a physicianŠa teacher, and not a dispenser of drugs. It might be well for him to assume the role, directing not how to administer medicine, but how not to administer it. Let the edu-cated physician give his attention to those manipulations in surgery and kindred arts, where success is evident and certain. Let him educate his patients so that they will under-stand the laws of health, and not suppose that they can violate them with the expectation that the physician will be responsible if the punishment for so doing is not averted. Let him attend to the diagnosis of disease. This is a field in which a skilled physician can best distinguish himself from the army of quacks who surround him, and this is a branch of medicine in which such perfection has been at-tained as to place it high in the rank of sci-ences. If the intelligent physician believes that in three-fourths of the cases where medi-cine is prescribed, the patient would recover under the same hygienic conditions as well without as with it, let him earn the gratitude of the invalid by telling him that such is the factŠthat his disease is self-terminating, and that a fatal result is not to be apprehended. He would thus discourage deceit, relieve him-self from the ignominy of failure, which he might incur by prescribing where medicine is uncalled for, as it often is in cases necessarily fatal ; and he would take away the prestige of success from those who can prescribe equally well with himself, where the patient is sure of recovery ; and in the comparatively few cases where the issue of the disease depends on the skillful selection of drugs, his real knowledge, and the results of a careful training, will be strikingly manifest. When the time arrives in which the physi-cian will not prescribe until it is manifestly for the safety or comfort of his patient to do soŠwhen he will not allow himself to be deceived or to deceive othersŠthen medicine will take rank with surgery as one of the positive sci-
