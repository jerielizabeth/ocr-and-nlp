534 ADVENT REVIEW AND SABBATH HERALD. TVoL. 71, No. 34. back, step by step, to his original design,Šthat man should subsist upon the natural products of the earth. Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord, meat-eating will event-ually be done away ; flesh will cease to form a part of their diet. We should ever keep this end in view, and endeavor to work steadily to-ward it. I cannot think that in the practice of flesh-eating we are in harmony with the light which God has been pleased to give us." At this season of the year sweet-corn might form a part of almost every meal. Removed from the cob and simply cooked in a little milk, or added to an equal quantity of freshly cooked new beans, seasoned with a little cream, it makes some excellent side-dishes. Boiled or steamed without removal suits some people better, and affords variety. The hull is quite indigestible, unless it be thoroughly mas-ticated. But troubles arising when corn is used, should not always be laid 'to it ; for like "Poor Tray," it may be the company it is in: For many persist in using with it condiments, butter, and other fats. From the above-mentioned book, page 47, we read : "Fruits, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a simple way, free from spices and grease of all kinds, make, with milk or cream, the most healthful diet." The hulls may be easily discarded in the,.fol-lowing manner : With a sharp knife cut length-wise o C each row of kernels, and then with the back of the knife, held at such an angle as not to remove the hulls, scrape lengthwise of the ear. The pulp thus removed may be cooked in any way in which the whole kernel usually is, and will be found easy of digestion. If placed in a double boiler or over a kettle of boiling water until the milk of the corn is set, it may be dried on plates, and in a few hours be ready for winter use. Fresh, it is very fine for soup by simply cooking it thoroughly in milk. Probably most tastes will require a little salt, which should not be added until nearly ready to serve. " Korn-let" is an article identical with the above, and is prepared in Forestville, Chautauqua Co., N. Y. Many excellent and economical recipes for the preparation of corn are given in the cook book, " Science in the Kitchen," by Mrs. E. E. Kellogg. Here is one from page 261 Š " #tewed Corn and Tomatoes.ŠBoil dried or fresh corn until perfectly tender, add to each cup of corn two cups of stewed, strained toma-toes, either canned or freshly cooked. Salt to taste, boil together for five to ten minutes, and serve plain or with a little cream added." ZWIEBACK. THE foundation of all toasts is zwieback, or twice-baked bread, prepared from good whole-wheat or Graham fermented bread cut in uniform slices not more than a half-inch thick, each slice being divided in halves, placed on tins, or what is better, the perforated sheets recommended for baking rolls, and baked or toasted in a slow oven for half an hour or longer, until it is browned evenly throughout the entire slice. The zwieback may be prepared in considerable quantity and kept on hand in readiness for use. It will keep for any length of time if stored in a dry place. Stale bread is the best for making zwieback, but it should be good, light bread ; that which is sour, heavy, and not fit to eat untoasted, should never be used. Care must be taken also not to scorch the slices, as once scorched, it is spoiled. Properly made it is equally crisp throughout, and possesses a delicious, nutty flavor. Its preparation affords an excellent opportu-nity for using the left-over slices of bread, and it may be made when the oven has been heated for other purposes, as after the baking of the bread, or even during the ordinary cooking, with little or no additional heat.Š" Science in the Kitchen."

While these words of the prophet are true in a general sense, they are more so of certain localities ; especially in a benighted papal country like Brazil. I have just returned from a trip to Santos, a large sea-port town about a day's journey south from Rio de Janeiro. In all my travels, I never have seen a place where there is such disregard of the Bible and everything religious, such drunkenness, sin, and demoralizing habits as are practiced openly here. This is not to be wondered at when we know that there is neither a gospel mission nor a missionary in all the place, which has over 15,000 inhabitants. This illustrates to what depths of degradation men will fall without the saving truths of the gospel, and what the preach-ing of that gospel, though imperfectly done, will do for a community. Here a medical mis-sionary should locate at once ; and not only here, but there is room for many more to engage in the same line of work in other parts of this country. But these must be men who will not count their lives dear unto themselves ; men who are saved themselves, having realized the cleans-ing, saving, and healing power of Christ ; and who have a faith that will not be deterred by difficulties, however great. When we recognize the voice of Christ telling us to go, it is our duty to do so, and not to stand waiting, inquiring if the climate of a certain country is healthful, or if the people, etc., are to our liking. We are not to stand in fear of bad climates or contagious diseases ; for if the Lord calls, we may trust all these things in his hands. The human heart is everywhere the same. God made all nations alike, and to save them he per-forms the miracle of conversion: If we desire to be his representatives, we must lay aside all prejudice against a country and its people. 0 for more of the good Samaritan's love and com-passion, that will not slight nor pass by the poor, degraded, suffering sinner. Now as the rebellion here is being put down, and the country is slowly recovering, the pros-pects for the message are more favorable ; but still the work goes hard and slow, requiring much patience and perseverance. It is only by the interposition of the Lord raising up a standard against the enemy, that anything can be accom-plished. I have just now received responses to letters written last year to brethren in the State of Santa Catharina. The delay was due to com-munications having been cut off by the revolu-tion. The letters from these brethren are most encouraging, making loud appeals for ministerial help and reading-matter to be sent them. One brother writes that there is a company of upward of seventy-five Sabbath-keepers in the locality where he lives. They are divided, however, into two factions, but all keep the Sabbath. May we not hope that these dear souls will yet receive the truth fully, as some of them are already re-joicing in the light and call to us to come and help them ? Brother Dressel, in another section of the same State, writes very encouragingly, and makes an earnest appeal for help. Also the Ger-man brethren in Argentina write that the Lord is blessing them greatly, and adding others to their company, so that in all there are now twenty-six who are keeping the Sabbath there. Praise God for this. I rejoice to know that Elder Westphal will soon be with them, and I am cer-tain that a rich harvest of souls awaits his efforts there. And a still richer harvest is to be reaped by earnest labor bestowed upon this field. But where are the reapers ? Much will be lost if we wait longer. We call again for German help for this field, and we ask for not less than one worker for each province that contains German  colonies which are eight in number. We do not ask for canvassers who may desire to come here to make money, but for consecrated men, women, or families to locate in these different provinces to engage in all kinds of missionary work as the way may open, that other laborers may be developed by their efforts. From letters received I notice that some of our brethren seem to be under the impression that English is spoken and taught here the same as in America. To such I would say that Portu-guese is the language of this country, and those contemplating coming to this field should make it their purpose to learn to read and speak this language as soon as possible. I have not learned if Resolution No. 41 in General Conference Bul-letin No. 20, has been acted upon in behalf of this tongue. 0 how much we need publications in the language of this people ! In default of these I have not been able to do for them what I desired.. A Portuguese brother who has been investigating for some time, has decided to keep the Sabbath, and is now communicating the truth to others. But without publications hardly anything can be accomplished. May the God who answers prayer, soon bring to pass the desire of our hearts. It is true that spiritual darkness covers these South American countries, but the glory of the third angel's message is lightening all the earth, and with joyous hearts we see its bright rays breaking through the clouds, and precious souls are rejoicing in its saving light. What a privi-lege it is to be carrying the everlasting gospel to these dark places ; and although the work may develop slowly and go hard, in the end the results will be the more glorious. The sheaves gathered from these darkened fields may be few in number, but even with these we shall soon return with rejoicing ; for one soul saved is worth more than the whole world. A. B. STAUFFER. Rio de Janeiro, July 9. RELIGION IN MEXICO. ALTHOUGH Mexico is so near to us, yet to Americans generally it is a terra 'incognita, especially in regard to its religious institutions. The following extract is from a paper by Henry Taylor, in the Citoyen Franco-Americaine:Š " Mexico is as much a heathen country and its people are as much idolaters as those of Africa. Go where you will, in churches, streets, stores, and private houses, saints and images are wor-shiped, but no Jesus. The same persons will go on Sunday morning to their devotion for half an hour, and to the race-track in the after-noon. Sunday is not kept in Mexico. " Stores of all kinds are open, the markets are in full blast, theaters and circuses have two performances on Sunday, and bands of music, furnished by the government, perform at many of the plazas and squares. " We were shocked to see some of the boarders at an American house playing checkers just the same as on other days, but we found that was the regular practice, and on some Sundays they go to the races as well as the theater. "Mexico is nominally Roman Catholic. The president, governors, and rulers are all Catholics and always have been. But it is a fact not very well known that in all Mexico there is neither convent, nunnery, monastery, nor anything of that kind in existence. No priest or monk is allowed to walk the streets with any distinguishing garb on ; no nun dressed as such is allowed in the streets of Mexico ; no sister of charity (so-called) is allowed in public. Catholicism is precisely the same everywhere ; give it an inch, and it will take a yard. The rulers of Mexico found that out and took away the inch, in a political sense. Catholics have no more power than any other denomination except in numbers. All are on the
