PERPETUITY OF THE ROYAL LAW OR, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS NOT ADOLISHED BY J N ANDREWS IT is painful to witness the various inconsistent and self contradictory positions resorted to by those who reject the Sabbath of the Lord But of all the positions adopted, none seem so dangerous, orfraught with such alarming consequence; as the view that the Jaw of God, by which the Sabbath is enforced, has been abolished, and that we are, therefore, under no obligation to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy The question whether God has abolished his law or not, is, indeed, the main point at issue in the Sabbath controversy; for when it is shown that that law still exists, and that its perpetuity is clearly taught in the New Testament, the question is most conclusively settled, that the Sabbath is binding on us, and upon all men The Sabbath of the Lord is embodied in the fourth commandment of the Decalogue This com mandment stands in the midst of nine moral pre cepts which Jehovah, after uttering with his own voice, wrote with his own finger on the tables of stone These nine commandments stand around the Sabbath of the Lord, an impregnable bulwark, which all the enemies of that sacred institution in vain attempt to destroy It is evident that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment cannot be set aside unless the Deca LADJAV L12 11EV21, AND SABBATH HERALD "Here is the Patience of the Saints; Here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus." V u VI ROCHESTER, N Y., THIRD DAY, AUGUST 15, 1854 No 1 logue can be destroyed Hence the enemies of the Sabbatic institution have brought their heaviest artillery to bear upon the law of the Most High: calculating that when they had destroyed this strong hold, the Sabbath would fall an easy prey to their attack We invite attention then to the law and to the testimony By the unerring word of God we wish to settle this question; and this we believe can be done in the most satisfactory manner That the hand writing of ordinances containing the feasts, new moons and the associated annual sabbaths of the Jews, has been abolished and taken out of the way,we do not doubt This was not the morallaw of God; butwasir merely the shadow of good thingsto come But thn royal law in which are the ten command ments of God is the subject of this investigation, and it is the perpetuity and immutability of this law that we affirm If the law of God has been destroyed, the act must have been accomplished by one of three things; viz., 1 By the teachings of the Lord Jesus; or 2 By his death; or 3 By the apostles We believe that all will agree to this statement 1 Was the law of God abolished by the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ? Let tis listen to his own words " Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill For verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled Whosoever there fore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do, and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." Matt v, 17 10 Our Lord here testifies that he did not come to destroy the law or the prophets Then it is a fact that he did not destroy either But what is it to destroy the law? We answer, that it can only sig nify to abolish, or to annul it And thus Campbell renders the word : " Think not that I am come to subvert the law." Whiting renders it : " Think not that I am come to annul the law." It is therefore certain that our Lord did not Oorne to subvert, annul, or destroy, the law of God Hence it follows thatthe law of God WAS not annulled or abrogated by him He adds, that instead of coming to destroy, he came to fulfill If this was the object of the Saviour's mission, did he not by this act do away the law, set it aside, and relieve us from obligation to keep its precepts? Let us see As Campbell renders the text, it reads, "1 am not come to subvert, but to rati fy." That is, I am not come to abolish the law, but to confirm, and render still more sacred, its just demands If that was the object of our Lord's mission, it fol lows that he did not lessen our obligation to obey the law of his Father But let us return to the word "fulfill." Christ came to fulfill the law, hence he did fulfill it What is it to fulfill a law ? Let the apostle James answer: "If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scrip ture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well; but if ye have respect to persons, ye com mit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgress ors." James ii, 8, 9 It is evident that James here places the transgression of the law in contrast with, or in opposition to, the fulfillment of the law; there fore it follows that the fulfillment of the law is the reverse of its violation In other words, it is its ob servance To fulfill the law in the manner that James enjoins, is to render complete obedience to its divine requirements But it may be contended that to fulfill the law in the sense of our Lord's declaration, accomplishes its purpose, and takes it out of the way To show the absurdity of this view, let us take another of Christ's sayings which is of the same character, precisely When John refused to baptize the Saviour, Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." Math iii, 15 Did the Saviour, by fulfilling all righteousness, weaken, take out of the way, or destroy all righteousness? Certainly not No one will claim that he lessened our obligation to fulfill all righteousness also But how did Christ fulfill the law of his Father? There is but one way in which this could be accom plished, and that is to answer its just demands What were those demands? We answer: first, the w of God demands perfect obedience The justice of this, none will deny But when the law has been violated, it demands the death of the transgressor Sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John iii, 4 "The wages of sin is death;." Rom vi, 23 "The soul that sinneth it shall lie." Eze xviii, 4 When Christ came to fulfill the law, he came to do this, not for himself, but in behalf of our race He came to fulfill the law as the Messiah: an office or charac ter which no other being ever possessed He came to undertake for fallen men, and in a certain sense placed himself in their situation What then was the relation which our race sustained to the law of God? We answer: all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God The law of God stopped every mouth, and showed all men sinners in the sight of God Rom iii, Then, when he Saviour took upon himself our nature, and calne to fulfill the law of his Father, that law not only demanded perfect obedience, lint it al so justly demanded the death of our race; for all were its transgressors The work of the SaviourrfEere fore, in fulfilling the law of his Father, was of a two fold character He must first render perfect obedience to all its precepts, and then offer up his own life as a ransom for guilty man To fulfill the law as the Messiah, Christ must perform all this Did he thus do ? He kept, his Father's commandments John xv, 10 In him there was no transgression of the law 1 Jolts: iii, 4, 5 He was the Lamb of God without spot, 1 Pet i, 19 in whom the Father was well pleased Matt iii, 17 And this was not all ; he took upon himself the sin of the world Isa 6; John i, 29 He bore our sin in his own body up on the tree 1 Pet ii, 24 He died the just for the unjust, giving his own life a ransom for many l Pet iii, 18; Matt xx, 28 God can now be just and yet justify him that believeth in Jesus Rom iii, '25, 26 Thus Christ lived our example and died our sacrifice Did this work of the Messiah, in rendering per fect obedience to all the law of God, and then offer ing up himself as a ransom for its transgressors, weaken that law, or lessen our obligation to obey it i Never It shows in the most striking light, its per petuity and immutability The law of God con demned our race Jehovah would open the way for man's salvation He could not destroy his own mor al law; but he could give his own beloved and on ly Son to die for its transgressors This evinces the estimate which the Father placed upon Isis own law Isaiah predicted that Christ should magnify the law, and make it honorable lsa xlii, 21 The record of Christ's life and death shows the fulfillment of this prediction But Christ adds a solemn affirmation "For veri ly, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled What is a jot and a tittle? A jot is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet A tittle is a small point by which some of those letters are distinguished from others Our Lord therefore
