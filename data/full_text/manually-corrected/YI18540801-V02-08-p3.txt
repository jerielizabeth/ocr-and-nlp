# YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR.   59 

with the life of the Christian are represented 
by various parables and figures in the 
Bible. Sometimes they are represented by one 
running a race, and again by one engaged in 
warfare, &e. "So run that ye may obtain." 
"Let us run with patience the race that is set 
before us." "I have fought a good fight." 
"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, 
but mighty through God to the pulling 
down of strong holds." 

From the figures here used it is evident that 
all hope of successful victory, by those thus engaged,
depends upon perseverance. The same 
is true of the Christian. His life is across bearing, 
self-denying life, and perseverance in the 
discharge of every duty, must characterize him, 
if he would win the prize and wear the crown. 

"Then on let us press; for Jesus is near, 
And strengthen each other with words of good cheer; 
With zeal ever buoyant and courage ne'er slack, 
Let's be true to our King and never draw back." 

The blessed promise "and as thy days, so 
shall thy strength be," should encourage us to 
great diligence, and to be not weary in well-doinn. 

"Wherefore take unto you the whole armor 
of God, that ye may be able to withstand in 
the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about 
with truth, and having on the breastplate of 
righteousness; and your feet shod with the 
preparation of the gospel of peace; * * Praying 
always with all prayer and supplication in 
the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance 
and supplication for all saints." 

Again, in consideration-of the reward which 
awaits all who endure in the christian warfare 
unto the end, we urge the importance of perseverance. 
"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be 
ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in 
the work of the Lord, forasnuch as ye know 
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord." 1 
Cor. xv, 58. " Now he that planteth and he 
that watereth are one: and every man shall receive 
his own reward according to his own labor." 

The reflection that one may secure a home 
in the mansions of glory, and forever enjoy the 
society of the blood-washed throng, and reign 
with Christ in his soon coming kingdoni, encourages 
me to press on and cheerfully bear all the 
allotments of a kind and gracious Providence, 
till I reach my happy home in glory. 

Dear reader, I deeply feel for your salvation, 
and do most earnestly pray that you may avail 
yourself of the means in mercy granted by the 
great Giver of every good and perfect gift, for 
a home in the kingdom of heaven. 

To those who have not yet made their peace 
with God, allow me to say, that the Spirit of 
God has undoubtedly often impressed you with 
the importance of making an immediate preparation 
for the solemn events of the future, and  

you have doubtless resolved frequently to obey 
its teachings: if so, reduce these promises and 
resolutions to practice without delay, and faithfully 
persevere until you hear the welcome plaudit, 
"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."

## KING UZZIAH. 

DEAR CHILDREN :- Do you realize what a 
privilege it is, to have kind friends, who take 
such an interest in your welfare and future salvation, 
as to send you such an interesting paper, 
filled with words of kindness and instruction. 
Do you read them carefully, and ponder 
upon them ? How much pains is taken, to 
make the communications simple, so that you 
can understand them. How many kind and affectionate 
letters are written, to encourage and 
assist you. I trust you are thankful for them, 
and try to profit by them. 

Most Children love stories. There are a 
great many good stories in the Bible, which are 
very instructive. I will relate one to you which 
will teach you a moral. It is the history of 
king Uzziah, who lived in the days of Zechariah. 
You will find the history in 2 Chron. xxvi. 
Uzziah was the son of Amaziah, who was slain 
for his wickedness. Uzziah was only sixteen 
years old when he began to reign in his father's 
place. Now Uzziah acted very wisely, for 
he hearkned to Zechariah who was a prophet of 
the Lord, and the Lord instructed him through 
visions which he gave to Zechariah. Uzziah 
prospered, and became very rich. God helped 
him in all his undertakings, and gave him victory 
over his enemies, as long as he called on 
the name of the Lord. 

But Uzziah became proud, and his heart was 
lifted up and he acted very wickedly. But God 
punished him for his sin, You have read the 
lessons on the Sanctuary, and I suppose you 
know the office of the Priest is to minister in 
the sanctuary. Now Uzziah was so proud that 
he thought he could take the place of the Priest, 
and burn incense, and it would be acceptable to 
God. But God cannot look upon sin with 
the least degree of allowance." He saw him, 
and while the censer was in his hind, God smote 
him with leprosy ; and Uzziah was driven out 
from among the people of God, and was despised 
and rejected of them. He lived solitary 
and forsaken, and died a leper. Now Uzziah 
knew better than to enter the temple of the 
Lord ; for the Priest alone had a right to enter 
there. The Lord dealt very justly with Uzziah. 

Here is a lesson to the proud and exalted. Do 
you not see how foolish and wicked it is to become 
exalted. If men only considered, how 
frail and weak is poor mortal man, and how liable 
he is to err, they would not exalt themselves 
above their fellow creatures. What a
