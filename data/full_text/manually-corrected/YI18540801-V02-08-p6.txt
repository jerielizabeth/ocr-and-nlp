that Thou shalt not kill is a part of the law he 
is talking about. The apostle James says, Whosoever 
shall keep the whole law, and yet offend 
in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that 
said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not 
kill. James ii, 10, 11. Now James teaches us 
to keep the whole law, but does not give us the 
whole law. He gives us, however, two commandments 
of the law of which he speaks. 
These two are, Do not commit adultery, and, Do 
not kill. Now if we can find a whole law, and 
these two precepts are a part of it, we must keep 
the whole of it, even if we find it in the Old Testament; 
for James teaches us that whosoever 
does not keep the whole is guilty. 

### QUESTIONS.-

Where is the whole law of God not 
found? How many histories of the life of Christ does 
the New Testament contain? What are they sometimes 
called? What book comes next? What are the 
epistles? What is the last book in the Bible called? 
What things were shown to John in vision? What 
is there in all the scriptures? What is often spoken of? 
What does this show us? What did Christ and the 
apostles affirm to be binding? When was the law of 
which Christ spoke in Mntt. v, 18, given? How much 
of it does he teach us to keep? What is a part of that 
law? What does the apostle James say? How many 
commandments of the law does he repeat? What are 
they? What must we do if we find a whole law of 
which these two are a part? 

## NUMBER IV. 

Let us now look for the law of God in that 
part of the Bible called the Old Testament. 
The book of Genesis is a brief history of events, 
beginning with the creation of the world, and 
extending over a period of more than two thousand 
years. During this time there lived some 
men who were approved of God, such as Abel, 
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, and Jacob. 
These the Lord called righteous men, because 
they did right. But there were many wicked 
men in those times, like Cain who killed his 
brother, and God sent dreadful judgments upon 
them for their sins. At cine time he sent a 
flood of water upon the earth, and destroyed all 
men living but eight persons; [Gen. vii;] at another 
time he rained fire and brimstone on four 
cities, and burned them up with all their inhabitants, 
with the exception of one man and a part 
of his family. Gen. xix. 

But the law of God is not writteu in the book 
of Genesis. No set of rules are here given for 
men to live by. But it is reasonable to suppose 
that God had then revealed to risen what was 
right and what was wrong. Those righteous 

men must have been taught of God what actions 
were right. And, in fact, we know that 
they had the law of God, although it is not 
written in the history of these times, that is, the 
book of Genesis. For God says, Abraham obeyed 
my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, 
my statutes, and my laws. Gen. xxvi, 5. 
He could not have kept a law before that law 
was made known to him. So we know that 
God had a law and righteous men kept it, 
thought the law itself is not recorded here. 

On the other hand, those wicked men who 
were destroyed by flood and flame, broke 
the law, and were sinners in the sight of God. 
And they could not be sinners without a law, 
for sin is the transgression of the law, [1 John 
iii, 4,] and where no law is there is no transgression. 
Rom. iv, 15. 

Thus we see that the law of God existed during 
those early ages, that good men kept it, and 
bad men broke it; and wherever we can find a 
whole law which God has given at any time,
we may be confident that it is the same law 
which those righteous men kept ; for he does not 
change, and his perfect rule of right cannot change. 

### QUESTIONS.- 

What is the book of Genesis? Beginning 
with what? Over how long a period does it extend? 
What faithful men lived during this time? 
What did the Lord call such men? Why? Who else 
lived in those times? What did God send upon them? 
What for? How many persons were saved from the 
flood? Where is the law of God not written? What 
did God say to Abraham, by which we know that 
there had been a law given in his time? What were 
those wicked men who were destroyed? What is sin? 
What is said in Rom. iv, 15? If we find a whole law 
somewhere else, in the Bible, of what may we be confident? 

## WHERE ARE YOU GOING 

DEAR CHILDREN :- As I was riding on the cars 
the other day I saw many people traveling, and 
they were laughing and talking very merrily. 
Some of them had on gold finger-rings and gold 
ear-rings, and gold breast-pins, and gold chains 
about their necks, and a great number of laces 
and ribbons ; and as I sat and looked at them, I 
thought, Do they know where they are going? 

Well, children, there are but two places 
where they can go at last. These (the wicked) 
shall go away into everlasting punishment, but 
the righteous into life eternal. Matt. xxv, 46.
So you see, children, that all must go to one of 
these two places; and yet a great many people 
act as though they ,thought themselves bound 
for no place in particular. 

Now, children, if you should go to Boston harbor
