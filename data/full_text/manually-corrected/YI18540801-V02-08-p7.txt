and there see a fine vessel all ready for 
sailing on the Ocean, and should ask the captain 
for what port he was bound, and he should 
say, Oh to no place in particular; and then if 
you should ask him if he had a compass and 
and chart and quadrant by which he might 
tell the direction, the latitude and longitude in 
which he was sailing, and he should say, No, I 
do not need any ; I ask if you would like to go 
on board that boat, or wish your friends to do 
so? I think not. If you did go you might expect 
to be dashed in pieces on the rocks in some 
heavy gale of wind. Now, my little friends, 
you have all started out on the ocean of time 
and the boat you are sailing in is your little 
frail body, only kept above the waters by the 
power and kindness of your heavenly Captain, 
who wishes you to take the Word and Spirit, 
for your chart and compass. Now, will you do 
it? Will you watch and pray that your vessel 
may safely land in the port of Heaven, or will 
you through carelessness let your bark go down 
in the dark waters of perdition ? I think I hear 
you saying, I'll go no farther until I know that 
I have the smiles of Jesus, and am bound for his 
heavenly kingdom. 

Your friend and well-wisher, 

H. G. Buck.

From I. Deyoe.      

DEAR CHILDREN :- We are indeed greatly favored 
in having God's precious Word, which 
points us to the blessed Saviour. And as I feel 
a flame of sacred love kindle in my heart, and 
think of those dear young friends who number 
among God's litttle flock, the remnant, I consider 
myself happy in being privileged to address 
you in a few lines through the Instructor. 
I wish in simplicity to speak of the kind care 
God has for you, and the love, with which he 
tenderly looks down upon you and guards you 
from the wicked influences which daily surround 
you. He has kindly commissioned an angel 
to attend you in all your steps lest at any 
time you stray from virtue's path. He that 
clothes the lilies of the field, hath said, "The 
very hairs of your head are all numbered." Our 
blessed Lord when here upon earth, declared, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones 
which believe in me, it were better for him that 
a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and 
that he were drowned in the depth of the sea." 

Dear children, the Saviour now stands with 
arms outstretched, kindly inviting you, to turn 
from everything that is sinful and place yourselves 
under his kind care and protection. Yes, 
O yes, let us strive daily to enter into the ser- fvice of God with all our heart, and soon it will 
be said, " Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit 

the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation 
of the world." 

Yours in the hope of soon seeing Jesus.

### From M. G. Kellogg. 

DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS :- God has made a 
promise, that when Jesus, comes, he will redeem 
all the good from this wicked world, and 
give them a home in the bright world of glory. 
We all wish fo go there ; but in order for us to 
get there, we have all got a work to do, which 
no one can do for us. We have all sinned and 
would have been lost if Christ had not died for 
us ; but since he died for us, we can be saved 
if we will keep the commandments of God,and the 
faith of Jesus. We must keep the Sabbath, 
and all the rest of the commandments, The 
fifth one was given expressly for children. It 
reads, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that 
thy days may be long upon the land which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee," The land that he 
has promised to give us is this earth made new 
and glorious. Now, if you wish to live forever 
on the new earth where there will be no more 
pain nor sorrow, you must obey your parents 
in the Lord ; and the apostle Paul tells us that 
this is the first commandment with promise. 
Eph. vi, 1, 2. Now the way to honor your parents, 
is to obey them : if they tell you to do 
any thing you should do it cheerfully, you 
should be glad of the privilege of obeying them. 

I have seen children when their parents told 
them to do anything, they would say they did 
not wish to, they wait to be told two or three 
times, and then they wou'd be fretful, would 
murmur and complain, and if they did what 
their patents told them, they would go about it 
pouting and do it in a very careless manner and 
act as though they did not care for any one. 
Such children do not honor their parents; but 
they do dishonor them; and God is not well 
pleased with their actions. God loves children 
when they love and obey their parents; and 
unless they do this they cannot be saved when 
Jesus comes; but they will be destroyed by the 
seven last plagues, though their parents do 
keep the commandments. 

You must hearken diligently to the instructions 
of your parents; they are older than you 
are and they know a great deal more than you 
do; and you must listen to their teaching. 
Hear what Solomon, the wise man, says in 
Prov. i, 8, 9, "My son, hear the instructions of 
thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother; 
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto 
thy head, and chains about thy neck." Also in 
Prov. iv, 1, "Hear, ye children, the instruction 
of a father, and attend to know understanding; 
for I give you good doctrine : forsake not my 
law." Read the first four verses of Prov. vii.
