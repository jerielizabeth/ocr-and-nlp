had opened the eyes of her soul," she said, 
"and ought she not to praise Him ?" And the 
new Bible! Ah, surely she must carry it back; 
some happier blind girl might pluck the fruit 
from this tree of life, and find healing in its 
blessed leaves. And, holding the dear volume 
near to the beating of her heart, she knelt by 
her white cot to pray : "Dear and blessed Jesus, 
who lovest the poor and openest the eyes of 
the blind, I thank thee that thou hast not hidden 
thyself from a poor blind girl. And since 
I cannot read thy heavenly words, I pray that 
thou wilt whisper them into my soul, that my 
spirit may not be dark like my poor eyes. I 
can see thee with my heart, dear Jesus, and 
thou knowest that I love thee and love thy 
holy book." And she touched the open Bible 
with her lips. O joy! to the soft lips the slight 
indentations of the raised surface are clearly 
perceptible ; they trace the sharp outline, of the 
letters with unerring accuracy. With a low 
cry of joy, she passes line after line across her 
eager lips, she turns the leaf, the lips lose not 
their power. It is all clear, all easy now. The 
lips could do what the toil-hardened fingers 
could not - they could read. 

A twelvemonth after, I visited Dijon. The 
low kitchen wore its old look, but what a beaming, 
happy face was Marie's, as she sat in her 
rude chair, her basket of straw at her feet, reading 
her beloved Bible. Blind, it was full of 
light. "N'est il pas heureux," she murmured 
in her rich, musical tones, "n'est il pas heureux 
de bailer ainsi les douces paroles pendant que 
je les lis?" Is it not blessed to kiss the sweet 
words as I read? 

Dear eloquent lips, which the cold clay kisses 
now, told me this little tale, and I listened 
with starting tears, thinking how the poor blind 
girl would rise up in the judgment to condemn 
the many, who "having eyes, see not." 

Reader, do you love the blessed words of Jesus
with a love, heart-deep, heart-warm 
the poor blind girl of Burgundy? - Selected.

## A True Story

A SAILOR was asked what indued him first 
to attend to religion, and gave for his answer 
the following :- 

"I came home from my last voyage before 
Christmas, and journeyed home. Being late 
when I arrived, I had not the opportunity of 
seeing my oldest girl, about six years of age, 
until the following day. At dinner time, when 
she sat down, I began (beast like) to eat 
what was before me, without ever thinking of 
my heavenly Father who provided daily 
bread; but glancing my eye towards this girl, 
of whom I was doatingly fond, I observed her to 
look at me with astonishment. After a moment's 
pause, she asked me in a solemn and a 
serious manner, 'Father, do you never ask a 

blessing before eating?' Her mother observed 
me to look hard at her, and hold my knife and 
fork motionless; (it was not anger-it was a 
rush of conviction which struck me like lightning;) 
apprehending some reproof from me, and 
wishing to pass it by in a trifling way, she said, 
'Do you say grace, Nanny?' My eyes were 
still riveted upon the child, for I felt conscious 
that I had never instructed her to pray. The 
child seeing me wait for her to begin, put her 
hands together, and lifting up her eyes to heaven, 
breathed the sweetest prayer I ever heard. 
This was too much for me ; the knife and fork 
dropped from my hands, and I gave vent to my 
feelings in tears." Here a pause ensued. On 
recovering himself, he continued : "I inquired 
who had thus instructed the child. The mother 
informed me, the good people at the chapel 
next door; and the child would never go to 
bed, nor rise in the morning, without kneeling 
down to pray for herself and her dear father 
and mother. Ah ! thought I, and I never 
prayed for myself or for my children. I entered 
the chapel in the evening, for the first time, 
and continued to attend the means of grace 
there. The Lord having awakend me to a 
sense of my danger, through the instrumentality 
of a dear child, I am now seeking him with all 
my heart, and truly can say, I am happy in the 
thought that Jesus Christ came into the world 
to save poor sinners of whom I am chief." 

I hope all the little children who read this, will 
imitate the sailor's daughter.- Wesleyan. 

## PERSEVERANCE. 

THE certainty of success in attaining the object 
designed in every undertaking, not only in 
our temporal matters, but also in our spiritual 
welfare, depends very much upon perseverance, 
perhaps wholly. The plans and efforts of the 
farmer, or trades man, or the scholar all prove 
futile and unavailing without perseverance. So 
of the mariner who navigates the pathless 
ocean. He is often called to pass through winds 
and storms, and to meet a powerful and strongly 
opposing tide, and to encounter the dangers surrounding 
shoals and quick-sands, and many 
other imminent perils from which he could never 
escape without perseverance. But cheered 
and encouraged with the hope of success in the  
enterprise before him, he presses on through all 
the perils to which he is exposed by day and by 
night, passing months and years, far away from 
home and friends dear to him. 

But let us consider the importance of perseverance 
in the service of our heavenly Master. 
For without decision of character and energy of 
purpose in rendering obedience to the commandments 
of God, and the requirements of the 
gospel, there will be a corresponding loss of 
happiness, and trust in God. The duties connected
