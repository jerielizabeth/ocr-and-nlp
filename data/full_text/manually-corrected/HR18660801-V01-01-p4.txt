## Rest. 
## BY ELD. J. N. LOUGHBOROUGH. 

It is a principle established in all animate
nature, that action must be followed by rest. 
Persons who are prepared to 
properly care even for animals, understand 
that it will not do to overwork, or 
in any way overtax their energies. What 
would you think of a teamster who should
work his horses from five o'clock in the
morning, till ten, eleven, or even twelve
o'clock at night, day after day, six days
in the week, giving them only fifteen or 
twenty minutes three times a day to hastily 
eat? You say, such treatment would 
be abusive to horses; and horses themselves
thus treated, would very soon by 
their emaciated frames, be a swift witness 
against such as course.

But do not many human beings treat 
themselves worse than this? Do 
they not overwork, early and late? Do 
they not overtax their strength? Do 
they not eat their meal in ten minutes, in 
a tired condition of body? And do they 
not then again, rush out to their work 
without waiting for the process of digestion 
to be established before they impose 
another tax upon their system, and disturb 
and hinder nature in her work. 

While your feelings revolt at the abuse 
of the dumb brute, what say you to the 
idea of men and women making overworked 
jades of themselves? Thousands 
of our American people are doing every 
day what we have described above; rushing 
on with work, work, work, early and 
late. Working up to the minute their 
meals are ready, then hastily forcing 
their food into their stomachs, so as to 
hastily rush again into their work. Thus 
they go on without proper rest. Thus 
they go on without proper rest, till their 
food, they tell us, lies like a load in their 
stomachs, and by and by, somewhat 
mysterously (?) to them, they are sick. 

It is admitted on all hands, that our 
animals must have a proper amount of
rest, and that regularly every twenty-four 
hours, in order to thrive. The careful 
groom wishes his horse to rest a few 
minutes before partaking of hearty food. 
All this is right. Horses are flesh, so are
we. For them to eat uncooked grain in 
a heated, tired condition of body, will 
make disturbance in their stomachs; so 
it will for us to eat cooked food while in 
the same condition. By observation, you 
learn that those laboring animals thrive 
best which perform all their labor in the 
daytime, having the night undisturbed 
for rest, and who also have a little time 
of rest before and after their regular rations 
of food. The same principle you 
may find, by experiment, holds good with 
yourselves.

I have tried both ways, and can speak 
what I know. I have tried irregular 
rest and regular rest; eating in haste
while heated or weary, and eating slowly 
in a rested condition; working early and 
late, to do two days' work in one, and 
being content to secure proper rest and 
do a moderate day's work in one day; 
and I have made a permanent choice to 
follow taht course that will secure to me 
every day so much rest that I shall not 
feel that my energies are wasted, but that 
I have still strength remaining each day 
to do one-half day's work more that 
day, if it was necessary. I am confident 
that in pursuing such a course, I can accomplish
more, month by month, than I 
could to go back to my former hurried 
habits of work without proper rest.

The rules which I try to follow, are 
these: To retire at 9 o'clock, not with 
my mind loaded down with care and 
anxiety, but, as much as possible, free 
from care. This condition can be secured 
by avoiding, at least for one or two hours 
before retiring, all exciting topics of conversation.
I also try to avoid, for a 
couple of hours before retiring, anything
like hard labor, so that by this means rest 
is commenced, and it is comparatively an 
easy matter to go to sleep. Retiring 
thus, in a properly ventilated room, not 
to sleep on heating feather, but on 
straw, husks, or a hair or moss mattress 
or something of this character, it is not a 
very difficult thing to secure a good, refreshing 
night's rest, and by five or six 
o'clock in the to rise with joy in 
the heart, and praise on the tongue.

I have found that to secure that rest 
which is necessary, other things must be 
considered. If I wish to get rest, I must 
not over-labor during the day; neither 
do I perform my hardest labor before 
breakfast. I find great benefit in spending 
one hour at least, in light out-door 
labor, taking time to come in and get rest 
of from fifteen to twenty minutes from 
any fatigue before breakfast. If the meal 
is eaten slowly, and we wait three-quarters 
of an hour or an hour after our meal 
is eaten before commencing work, the 
process of digestion will be well established
