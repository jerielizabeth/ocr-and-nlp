# 64  YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 

God has commanded your parents to teach you 
his law ; and unless you hearken to them and 
remember what they teach you, it will do you 
no good. First he tells your parents to teach 
you, and second, he tells you to hearken to what 
they say. Hear him ? "And these words which 
I command thee this day shall be in thine heart 
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy 
children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest 
in thy house and when thou walkest by the 
way and when thou liest down and when thou 
risest up." Deut. vi, 6, 7. This he says to your 
Parents. Now hear what he says to you in 
Prov. i, 8. "My son, hear the,  instruction of 
thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother." 

You must study the holy Bible, and get wisdom. 
If you should study all the books in the 
world and not study the Bible you would not 
be wise ; because you would not know who the 
true God is, you would not know what you 
must do, to live forever in the bright world of 
glory with Jesus and the holy angels. But on 
the other hand if you study the holy Scriptures 
and obey them, you will be what the Bible calls 
a wise child. Hear what Paul tells Timothy, [2 Tim. iii, 15,] And that from a child thou 
hast known the holy Scriptures which are able 
to make thee wise unto salvation through faith 
which is in Christ Jesus. You see the holy 
Scriptures were able to make Timothy wise, and 
he studied them when he was a child ; now if 
you wish to become wise, you must study your 
Bible (read Ps. ≈Åxix, 7,) and see what king David 
said would make the simple wise. "The 
law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; 
the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise 
the simple." Prov. x, 1. A wise son maketh a 
glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of 
his mother. See Prov, xv, 20 ; also xxix, 3. 
"A wise son rejoiceth his father." Then for 
you to rejoice your parents and make them glad 
you must be wise, and to be wise you must 
study the Scriptures and obey them. Though 
you may be poor, and have poor parents, if you 
do this it will be said of you, "Better is a poor 
and a wise child than an old and foolish king 
who will no more be admonished." Eccl. iv, 13. 
Your conversation must be right. " VA/ hoso offereth 
praise, glorifieth me ; and.to him that ordereth 
his conversation aright will I shew the 
salvation of God." Ps. 1, 23 ; 1 Pet. i, 15, 16. 
"But as he which has called you is holy so be 
ye holy in all manner of conversation ; because 
it is written, Be ye holy ; for I am holy." Your 
actions must be right; for " even a child is 
known by his doings, whether his work be pure 
or whether it be right." Prov. xx, 11. 

If you wish to stand on the mount Zion with 
your parents you must forsake all wicked company. 
If your young play-mates are wicked, 
you must leave them ; for the Lord has said it. 

Hear him. Prov. i, 10, 15. "My son, if sinners 
entice thee consent thou not. My son, 
walk thou not in the way with them : refrain 
thy foot from their path ; for their feet run to 
evil and make baste to shed blood." You must 
forsake them because "evil communications 
corrupt good manners" 1 Cor. xv, 33. Most 
children are very wicked now in these last days: 
they are stubborn and self-willed, disobedient to 
their parents and without natural affection : they 
are corrupt in their conversation, and corrupt 
in their manners and actions. The spirit that 
they manifest is entirely unlike the Spirit of 
Christ. Now children, if you associate with 
such ones, you will partake of their spirit, and 
become like them. One of the signs of the last 
days is, that children will be disobedent to their 
parents. 2 Tim. iii, 2. We see this plainly 
fulfilling in these last days. 

The Lord is soon coming, and those that are 
found pure, he will receive to himself and give 
them a home in the bright world of glory; 
while those who are disobedient to their parents 
and have not confessed and forsaken their sins, 
will be destroyed. 

My dear young friends, time is very short, 
and what you do to get ready to meet Jesus 
must be done soon. You must try every day 
to overcome some sin. If you are in the habit 
of getting angry' you must begin to-day to 
overcome. If your young play-mates do anything 
to displease you, you must not get angry 
but have patience : part of the third angel's 
message is, "Here is the patience of the saints." 
If you try to overcome, the Lord will help you; 
but though you pray, Lord, help me to overcome, 
and do not try to overcome you will not 
get the victory over one sin. 

Yours trying to overcome,
