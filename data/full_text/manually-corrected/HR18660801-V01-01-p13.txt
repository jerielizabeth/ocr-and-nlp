# TWO MEALS A DAY.  13

to the matter, makes the following statement:

"No little degree of excitement has 
been occassioned in this vicinity during the 
past week by the fact being made known 
that almost every member of a large fmaily 
have been affected with 
that dreadful disease, Trichinosis. It
seems that the family, or those of the family 
who were and are affected with the 
disease, had been partaking of portions of 
uncooked, but well-cured ham from hogs 
of their own raising, and that each of those 
who were in the habit, are affected and 
those of the family who remain healthy, 
were not in the habit of eating pork in any 
shape. Mr. Lansing, son-in-law of Mr.
Bemis, is the only unaffected and he
is one of a family of ten. In some of them 
the disease is much less severe than in 
others, in proportion as they partook of 
the pork. . . . . 

"Willy Lansing, the son of a son-in-law  
of Mr. Bemis, was the first to succumb to 
the disease, which he did last Friday 
morning, June 1. At 6 P.M. of the same 
day, all the physicians of the place held a 
post mortem over the boy, and have since 
found innumerable trichin√¶ in the different
muscles of the subject. Multitudes 
of anxious, inquiring people, of all ages,
sexes, and colors, have flooded the office 
and drug store of Dr. Ristinc and Co.,
McElhenny's drug store (the office of Dr. 
Smith), and the office of Drs. Bardwell 
and Wilson. Especially was the latter 
place crowded all day Sunday, with excited  
men, women, and children each and 
all desirous of having a view of the wondrous
parasite which infests the human 
flesh, and has already severed two links 
from a once happv and healthy family
circle in our community. Drs. May and 
Coulter, of Cedar Rapids, had a splendid 
microscope up here with them, which afforded
a fine and greatly magnified view 
of the destroying 'worm.' Mr. Henry 
Bemis, an uncle to the first victim of the 
disease, died the next day, and was buried 
Sunday afternoon." 

## A Good Item. 

A friend of Health Reform, in Oakland 
Co., Mich., in ordering the REFORMER, 
says: 
"I thought I would write a little of my experience 
on the benefit I have received from the 
books, How to Live. We read them, and commenced 
to live according to the light we received. 
The result is, my health has been better than for 
years before. We eat no meat, drink no tea or 
coffee, and have no use for a doctor. If we were 
sick, we should use water. I want to be purified 
both body and spirit."

## Two Meals a Day.

BY ELD. J. H. WAGGONER

The subjects of Diet and Rest are intimately 
connected. That of Diet is properly 
has three departments; relating to the 
quality and quantity of food to be taken,
and the proper times of taking it. In this 
as in everythign else related to health, 
an important consideration is, the due relation 
between labor and rest. If a man 
labors too many hours with his hands, his 
body is weakened; and if he persists in 
it, he is soon prostrated, worn out, and 
deprived of power to work at all. If he 
labors incessantly with his mind, his brain 
is wearied, and on continuance it becomes 
diseased; he finally loses the power of 
thought and reasoning-he becomes insane.
If too much labor is placed upon 
the stomach, it is afflicted with pain, or 
throws its burden on its ever-sympathizing 
friend, the brain, which causes a headache;
if this course is persisted in, it results 
in dyspepsia, or a disability to digest 
food, just as the power of the body 
or mind or any other part of the system 
is destroyed by over-labor. When the 
body is wearied by toil it recuperates or is 
refreshed, speedily, if there is no functional 
or local derangement. With the mind 
free, the stomach lean, and the circulation 
good, a speedy recovery of strength 
and energy is quite a matter of course. 
But if the stomach becomes wearied or 
diseased, it throws the affection to all 
parts of the system, and disqualifies them 
for aiding in its recovery; therefore the 
highest regard shoudl be paid to its condition.
The stomach is the supply depot-
the commissary department of the system,
and if it fails, all must fail.

Considering it evident that the stomach 
should have sufficient rest as well as any 
and every other part of the body, the inquiry 
arises, When should it have its rest? 
The answer seems natural: When the 
other parts rest; that is, in the night, or 
during sleep, when it need not be diverted 
from its rest, or even exercised through 
sympathy by the activity of the other 
parts. It is certainly doing great injustice 
to the stomach to put its burden of 
labor upon it just as the body is prepared
