## THE CHRISTIAN'S TRUST. 

'Tis said that once a dying girl, 
Who on the sea-coast dwelt, 
Was asked what she of Jesus thought, 
As death's approach she felt. 
How beautiful, and how sublime, 
This answer to receive: 
"Jasus - as limpets to the rocks, 
So unto him I cleave." 

O may we on the living Rock, 
With heart as firm abide; 
And cling, the rougher beats the storm, 
The closer to his side. 
Then will our faith and hope grow bright, 
Though earthly scenes grow dim; 
For he will never those forsake, 
Who put their trust in him.

## The Blind Girl and her Bible. 

MANY years ago, said the Rev. Monsieur V
- when a student in the University of Geneva, 
I was accustomed to spend the long summer 
vacations, traveling from village to village 
in my native France, preaching in the open 
squares the kingdom of God, distributing His 
holy word to those who would accept it, and 
teaching from house to house the blessed gospel 
of Jesus, my master. On such an excursion 
in the summer of 183-, I entered a little vine-hung 
cabin in the environs of Dijon. In its 
low, wide kitchen, I saw a middle aged woman, 
busily ironing, a boy yet too young for labor, 
and a girl of some seventeen or eighteen years, 
of a sweet serious aspect, platting straw. She 
did not raise her eyes as I entered, and, on a 
nearer approach, I perceived that she was 
blind. 

Saying that I was one sent to bring glad tidings 
of good things, I began to tell them the 
story of Christ, his love, his sufferings, his death. 
They listened attentively, and tears rolled slowly 
from the sightless eyes of the young girl. 
It was indeed tidings, new and wonderful, unto 
them, for like others of the simple peasantry of 
France, they were accustomed to sing sweet 
hymns and murmur devout orisons to "blessed 
Mary, mother mild," while Christ and his salvation 
were hidden from their hearts. The next 
day, and the next, I visited the widow's poor 

cottage, and Jesus, the good shepherd, gave me 
new cause for thankfulness, in permitting me 
to guide both mother and daughter to the fold 
of peace. 

Poor sightless Marie! how was she affected 
when I told her of Him who opened the eyes of 
the blind, and read to her how blind Bartimeus 
sat by the way-side begging, when he cried unto 
Jesus of Nazareth passing by, and received 
sight, Then, an irrepressible longing, such as 
she had never known before, a longing for God's 
blessed gift of vision, seized upon the poor blind 
girl ; not that she sighed to behold the blue 
heaven, or the golden light, or to look upon her 
mother's smile, or to gaze in her younger brother's 
laughing eyes. No, not these; but she 
longed to read the blessed words of Jesus, how 
he said, " Come unto me, and I will give you 
rest." 

There dwelt then in Dijon a man of God, who 
had gathered around him a few blind, whom he 
had taught to read and work. I sought him 
out, told him of Marie, interested him in her, 
arranged that she should come an hour every 
morning to learn to read, and procured for her 
a Bible with raised letters for the blind. 

You should have seen her delight as she started 
off next morning - a warm, bright August 
morning - one hand locked in het' little brother's, 
and the other fondly clasping her precious 
Bible, to take her first lesson. Alas, poor Marie!
it requires a delicate touch to distinguish 
the slightly raised surface and nice outline of 
the letters, and her fingers were hard and callous 
with the constant platting of straw. 
Again and again was the effort made, but to no 
purpose. Bbt one day, as she sat alone, sorrowfully  
chipping with her little knife the rough 
edges of the straw, a happy thought occurred 
to her. Could not she cut away the thick hard 
skin from her fingers, and then it would grow 
anew, smooth and soft, like the rosy fingers of 
a child? And so she whittled the skin from 
the poor fingers, heeding not the pain ; was it 
not that she might read the word of God? 
But the straw work could not cease ; it bought 
bread, and the wounded fingers were slow to 
heal. When the reading lesson was tried 
again, warm drops trickled from the bleeding 
fingers along the sacred line. It was all in vain. 

After the first bitterness of her disappointment,
Marie strove hard to be cheerful. "God
