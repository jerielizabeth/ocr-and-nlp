# PROPER FOOD OF MAN.   9
 
lf he must die, he will have another feast 
on that same swine.

Christ is the Great Physician. The
Lord has sometimes interposed his power 
to save fools from the effects of their folly. 
"Fools because of their transgression, and 
because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; 
and they draw near unto the gates of 
death. 'Then they cry unto the Lord in 
their trouble, and he saveth them out of 
their distresses. He sent his word and 
healed them, and delivered them from 
their destructions." Psa. cvii, 17-20. But 
does the Lord wish to encourage us to 
continue in our "transgression" and in 
our "iniquities," with the hope that he
will always pardon even our willing, if not 
willful, transgressions? No! The Author
of nature's laws is the Author of the 
ten commandments. It is sin to violate 
either of these codes. The moral law 
and the physical are blended together. 
We cannot satisfy one and offend the other. 
It is fanatical to think we can go on 
knowingly violating the laws of health by 
our manner of living, and when we get 
into trouble expect the Lord to heal us, 
and let us go on in the same coourse of 
transgression. It is the hight of presumption. 
It is extremely absurd. It is wicked. 
THE GREAT PHYSICIAN REQUIRES 
A CHANGE OF DIET. 

## Flesh as Food for Man.
## BY ELD. J. N. ANDREWS. 

What did the Author of our being design
as food for mankind? This question 
is not unworthy the thoughtful inquiry of 
our race. Observation will convince any 
candid man that one of the most frequent 
causes of disease is to be found in what 
is taken into the stomach. Yet most people
seem wholly unaware of the importance
of attention to this subject, and act 
as though it was a matter quite unworthy 
of their consideration. Such should not 
be the case with the Christian. He is 
strictly enjoined to glorify God in eating 
and drinking as well as in every other act 
of his life. To do this is to regard the l
aws of our being and to use such food as 
shall best promote health and strength, 
freedom from disease, clearness of mind, 
and cheerfulness and serenity of spirit. 
Health is a Christian duty, and sickness, 
as the result of a violation of the laws of 
our own nature, a sin against God. An 
enfeebled, diseased person will exhibit at 
best an enfeebled, sickly experience in the 
religion of Christ. The gloom and misanthropy 
of the dyspeptic will appear in almost
every part of his Christian experience. 
His will be a dyspeptic religion 
full of gloom to himself, much of which 
he will attribute to Satan, when he ought 
in justice to divide the blame between 
himself and Satan; taking to himself the 
responsibility of yielding to a depraved 
appetite, and attributing to the Arch-fiend 
the quite unnecessary part of tempting 
that appetite to its accustomed use of unwholesome 
food. Such an experience will 
be full of sadness and distress, a life-long 
burden to its possessor, and not unfrequently 
a serious source of grief to his 
dearest religious friends. Dyspepsia, the 
fruitful source of many evil diseases, is 
the direct result of transgression in the  
use of food. No person under its power 
is in a condition to glorify God as he 
should. The Author of man's being designed
that he should possess health, 
clearness of mind, and strength of body. 
These excellent properties consecrated to 
the service of God and of humanity, are 
of incalculable value to him that would 
glorify God in his body, and in his spirit. 
To be deprived of these, is generally at 
least, a great calamity, and not unfrequently
it is largely attributable to our 
own transgressions in the use of food. 
Those who devote themselves to the service 
of God cannot too deeply feel that 
what they give to him should be the best 
that they have; and that they who present 
themselves to God with every power 
of body and mind enfeebled, offer to him 
at best but a lame sacrifice. If we have 
health it is a religious duty that we preserve
it; if we are feeble and debilitated, 
then it is obligatory in the highest degree 
that we should, if possible, recover our 
health and strength, that we may devote 
these to the service of the God of Heaven.
Cease to do evil and learn to do well, 
is a direction quite as important in its 
bearing, when referred to the laws of our 
being as to the written law of God. 

But it is the object of this article to offer 
a few thoughts relative to flesh as food 
for man. That God for wise rnasons has 
given man permission to eat the flesh of 
animals is not denied. But it is certain 
that in the beginning it was not so. When 
God placed man in Paradise and bestowed 
on him every blessing that could make 
life desirable, he by law designated the
