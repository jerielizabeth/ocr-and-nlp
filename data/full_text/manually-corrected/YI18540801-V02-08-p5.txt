# YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR.   61

## NUMBER II. 

In our last lesson we mentioned two kinds of 
law. The first is the rule of duty towards God 
and each other. It is a rule by which we can 
tell what actions are right and what are wrong. 
For this reason we call it the moral law. By 
this law we learn what actions are sinful; for an 
Apostle says, sin is the transgression of the law. 
1 John iii, 4. All of us can see, then, that if man 
had not sinned, he would have kept this law. 

But the other kind of laws was given to man 
because lie was a sinner, that is, because he had 
transgressed the first law, or the law of right and 
wrong. This second law we call the ritual, or 
ceremonial law, because it consisted of rites, or 
ceremonies by which the believing, penitent sinner 
might obtain forgiveness of sins. If men had 
not broken the moral law of God, they never 
would have been obliged to perform rites for remission 
of sins. They never would have been 
commanded to take an innocent animal from the 
flock, and offer him, a sacrifice for sin, by shedding 
his guiltless blood. Those offerings were 
typical of Christ. The person offering them virtually 
acknowledged himself worthy of death for 
his sins, and expressed his faith in Christ, the 
Lamb of God, who was to come and die for the 
sins of the world. Now when we read of Christ's 
blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that 
was against us, which was contrary to us, and 
took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross, we 
know that the law that required those sacrifices 
for sin, is meant. God never gave man anything 
that was contrary to him, till he had done contrary 
to the moral law of God. 

The word, law, in the New Testament means, 
sometimes the first and sometimes the second law. 
We can always tell which is meant by what is 
said of it. When Jesus says, Till heaven and 
earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise 
pass from the law, [Matt. v, 18,] we know that he 
means the first, or moral law. But when Paul 
speaks of a law having a shadow of good things 
to come - which stood only in meats and drinks, 
(offerings,) and carnal ordinances, (rites and ceremonies,) 
imposed on them until the time of reformation, 
(till Christ the better sacrifice was offered,) 
[Heb. x, 1; ix, 10,] we know that he means the 
second, or ceremonial law. When James pronounces 
every person guilty who does not keep 
the whole law, [chap. ii, 10,] he speaks of the 
moral rule of God's government, which Jesus 

came not to destroy. Matt. v, 17. But when 
we read of the law of commandments contained 
in ordinances, those ceremonies are referred to, 
which Jesus came to abolish. Eph. ii, 15. 

### Questions.- 
What were mentioned in our last lesson? 
What is the first? What do we call it? What 
do we learn by this law? What does an Apostle say? 
Why was the other kind of laws given to man? What 
do we call this second law? Had men kept the moral 
law, what would they never have been obliged to perform? 
Of whom were offerings typical? Of what 
did the person offering them acknowledge himself 
worthy? In whom did he express his faith? What 
law did Christ nail to his cross? In the New Testament, 
what does the Word law mean? By what can 
we tell which is meant? What did Jesus say in Matt. 
v, 18? What law did he mean? What is referred to 
in Heb. ix, 10? 

## NUMBER III. 

The law of God, as a whole, is not found in 
the New Testament. This part of the Bible contains 
four histories of the life of Christ from his 
birth to his burial and resurrection, sometimes 
called the four gospels. Then an account of the 
doings of the apostles, how they preached the 
gospel, traveling from place to place. This is called 
the Acts of the Apostles. Then we have the 
epistles, which are letters written by the apostles 
to various churches and individuals. And last of 
all is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, given in 
vision to John, on the isle of Patmos, showing the 
things which were to take place afterwards, from 
that time to the end of the world, and the making 
of a new heavens and earth, in which the 
saints will live forever. 

In all these writings, or scriptures, there is 
no whole code, or body of laws; no part of them 
is called the law of God. But the law, and the 
commandments of God are often spoken of, and 
frequently some of them are repeated. This 
shows us that there had been a law given, which 
Christ and his apostles did not think it necessary 
to give again. But they affirmed the whole 
law to be binding. Our Saviour had given no 
body of laws to his disciples when he said, One 
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the 
law. Matt. v, 18. Then he spoke of a law 
which had been given before the first book of 
the New Testament was written ; and he teaches 
us to keep the whole of it. He says, Whosoever 
therefore shall break one of these least 
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall 
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. 
Verse 19. We see by reading a little further,
