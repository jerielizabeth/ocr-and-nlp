## Indulgence of the Appetite. 

Parents should ponder well on the danger
of an early and capricious indulgence 
of the appetites and imaginary wants of 
their children. Repetition soon becomes 
a habit, and a habit once formed, even in 
childhood, will often remain during the 
whole of after life, acquiring strength every 
year, until, at last, it sets all laws human 
and divine, at defiance. Let parents 
who yield to the cries of their children for 
dainty and promiscuous food, or who allow 
them to torment domestic animals, or 
to strike their nurses, or to raise the hand 
against any person, consider well on the 
consequences. The moral effects of pampering 
the appetites of children are most 
melancholy. Is the mother afraid of an 
explosion of passion, a bribe is too often 
promised in the shape of a cake or tart, 
as a peace offering. Does it annoy a 
whole company by its boisterous or ill-timed 
pranks, it is persuaded to be quiet 
by the promise of some sweet-meats. If 
it has been good, as the phrase is, the reward 
is still too frequently something for 
the stomach. Eating is soon regarded as 
the chief end and object of life by a child, 
who sees in it the chief incentive to good 
behavior. A premium would truly seem 
to be given for gluttouy. The use of the 
other nobler senses, and of the faculties of 
the mind, the early cultivation of the 
kindlier and better feelings of our nature 
-generosity, disinterestcduess, pity, fillial
love-all overcome or postponed in 
favor of the one sensual, selfish and absorbing 
act of gormandizing. 

## Mastication of Food. 

Mastication, or chewing, is the first step 
in the process of digestion. When food 
is taken, it should be thoroughly masticated
before it is suffered to pass into the 
stomach. Without chewing, the food is 
too coarse aud gross for the stomach, and 
is unprepared for the action of the gastric 
juice. Besides this, the actin of chewing 
causes the food to be mixed with the saliva
which is an important item in the 
preparation of it for the action of the 
throat in swallowing. The food should 
therefore be finely broken up, and thoroughly 
moistened with saliva. In order 
to accomplish this end, it is highly necessary 
that food should be taken with 
sufficient moderation to give time for 
the process of mastication, and the disharge 
of saliva from the glands of the 
mouth. Eating fast, or even talking 
while chewing, besides its incongruity 
with politeness and good breeding, is directly 
at war with thorough mastication. 

Many persons seem to think that hurrying 
their meals to save time, is economy; 
their business drives them, and they 
drive their time of meals into the smallest 
possible compass. This is miserable economy; 
for when they hurry down their 
food, half chewed and half moistened with 
snliva, it deranges the process of digestion 
throughout; and, as a consequence, 
the food not only sets bad on the stomach, 
and in time causes dyspepsia, but it 
fails to accomplish the sole object of taking 
it-the nourishment of the body. In 
order to derive nourishment from food, it 
must be well digested; hence it must be 
well masticated. When, therefore, we 
hurry our eating, we hasten our steps on 
the wrong road. Time curtailed in eating 
is worse than hiriug money at three 
per cent. a month. If we cannot spare 
time to eat, we had better not eat at all. 
This idea cannot be too deeply impressed; 
thousands, by this kind of careless, 
reckless eating, have found themselves 
the victims of dyspepsia and all its attendant
train of evils. The digestive organs 
may bear the abuse a while without 
giving many signs of trouble; but the 
penalty of that broken law must, sooner 
or later, come; and it may come in the 
form of a broken constitution. 

LUCK.-Some young men talk about 
luck. Good luck is to get up at 6 o'clock 
in the morning; good luck, if you have 
only a shilling a week, is to live upon eleven
pence and save a penny; good luck is 
to trouble your head with your own business, 
aud let your neighbor's alone; good 
luck is to fulfill the ten commandments, 
and to do unto people as we wish them 
to do unto us. They must not only work, 
but wait. They must plod and persevere. 
Pence must be taken care of, for they are 
the seeds of guineas. To get along in the 
world, they must take care of home, sweep 
their own door-ways, try to help other 
people, avoid temptation, and have faith 
in truth and God. 

Patients should cultivate patience.
