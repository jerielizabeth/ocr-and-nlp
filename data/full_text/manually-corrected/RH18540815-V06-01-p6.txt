## COMMUNICATIONS. 

### From Bro. Bates. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE:- Since I left Rochester, I 
have been laboring in Barre, Mill Grove, Lancaster, 
Olcott, and Orangeport, N. Y. Honest souls cease 
not to inquire for the truth. At our meetings in 
Mill Grove three gladly embraced the Sabbath in the 
message, and four were baptized in obedience to the 
command of the Great Head of the Church. 

The Churches in Barre and Orangeport have of 
late been much tried, and embarrassed with the proceedings 
of Messrs. Ira Wyman and R. R. Chapin.
Their vain boasting, and misrepresentations have 
opened the eyes of some that had in part sympathized 
with them. They now see that their motions 
were wrong, and continually tending to distraction 
and disunion. They now with but one exception, 
(and that a doubtful one,) concur with the Conference 
at Rochester ; particularly in the case of Ira Wyman, 
as published in Review, Vol. V. No. 22. 

These things have more fully convinced these Brn. 
of the necessity of having gospel order in the Church:
such order as was established by the Great Head of 
the Church and practiced by his immediate followers 
in the apostolic age. See Acts vi, 1-6; 1 Tim. iii, 
1-13; Titus i, 4-11; Acts xiv, 22, 23; xx, 17, 18, 
28-31. 

This has been attended to by the three churches in 
this quarter, so that they now have an Elder to watch 
over, and care for them; and we believe that the 
"Holy Ghost hath made them overseers, to feed the 
Church of God." Bro. R. F. Cottrell has labored 
with me in Mill Grove and Barre. 

Yours in love.

### From Bro. Hamilton. 

DEAR BRO. WRITE, and the Publishing Committee 
of the Review and Herald:- Dear Brethren, you 
are engaged in a most glorious cause ; therefore be 
encouraged. You have the prayers of the faithful, 
and God owns and blesses your labors; therefore if 
God be for us, no weapon formed against us can prosper. 
The Review is a welcome messenger to the little 
few that love God's law in this place. By it they 
are made to rejoice while they hear of the onward 
progress of the cause in other parts. It seems to be 
just what is wanted. It enlivens our love, our hope, 
our faith ; yea, it stimulates to every good word and 
work. May God's blessing rest upon it, and his wisdom 
be imparted to it, that it may be a savor of life 
unto life to all those that have an honest heart, into 
whose hands it may fall, is my prayer.

### From Bro. Steward. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE:- The Lord is still gracious 
in sparing life and prolonging the day of probation 
that we may have opportunity to repent and gain 
instruction so that we may be "sanctified through 
the truth." Since you left Wisconsin I have been laboring 
in the northern part of the State, mostly, in 
new places; and there seems to be a general interest 
to hear the truth; but it has been a very unfavorable 
time for meetings; yet I have had a meeting on 
every Sabbath but one, and on First-days also. I am 
now in Adario, holding a series of grove-meetings, 
Sabbaths and First days, and giving them a course of 
lectures on the Prophecies. Being called upon to 
give a Fourth-of-July oration at a Sunday-school celebration, 
I consented to give them two lectures on the 
two-horned beast. Did not set very well. I have 
found some who want the paper and I send their 
names.

### From Bro. Sheffield. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE :- It iS with pleasure that I 
now address a few more lines to you to inform you 
of the success of truth in this part of the State 
since you left us. Fifth-day, July 6th, Brn. Phelps, 
Hall and Stephenson met with the brethren in 
Hebron. An interest was awakened. Some had 
been investigating for some time. Sixth-day, Brn. 
Hall and Stephenson left to meet their appointment 
at Christania. Bro. Phelps came home intending to 
go back the same day to be with them over Sabbath ; 
but when he came home he found that his youngest 
son, aged about one year and eleven months, had 
been taken captive by death. This was sudden and 
unexpected, and they deeply mourned their loss; 
but they found consolation in considering that he 
was taken away from the evil to come; neither do 

they sorrow as those who have no hope: believing 
that when Jesus shall appear, them that sleep in 
him shall God bring with him. The funeral took 
place on the Sabbath. The following evening we left 
for Hebron where we arrived at day-break on First-
day. After meeting, eleven were buried with Christ 
in baptism. One brother among them had been a 
medium, but he became convinced by reading the 
Signs of the Times, that they were the spirits of Devils 
instead of the spirits of the dead, with whom he 
was holding communication. The result was, he 
came out to bear and investigate the truth, and he is 
now rejoicing in the same, because he has been delivered 
out of the snare of the enemy. The next 
Sabbath three more obeyed the Lord in baptism. 
Others are seriously investigating, who a week since, 
cared for none of these things. But this state of 
things has aroused another party in opposition to 
the truth. Seeing that their numbers are being diminished, 
they are uniting their efforts for more vigorous 
opposition ; but these things only tend to agitate the 
subject more, and lead others to investigate, to see 
whether these things are so. The school-teacher was 
among the number who embraced the truth. After 
this became known, an attempt was immediately 
made, to deprive her of her school, because she would 
no longer keep on the Sabbath, although she is far 
from her home and friends; but when arguments fail 
them, then they resort to other means to try to 
compel the unprotected and unoffending, to transgress
the commandments of God. By this we can 
see that the way is preparing for a contest,not far in the 
future; but our weapons are not carnal but spiritual. 
Let us try to do our duty and press the battle to the 
gate. Surely the time is not far distant when an image 
will be made to the beast which had a wound by 
a sword and did live. Already we see the church 
and world uniting to oppose the plain and simple 
truths of the Bible ; but we fear them not; for we 
know that they that be for us, are more than all they 
that are against us; for we know that we have not 
followed cunningly devised fables, when we made 
known the power and coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, but have followed the sure word of prophecy; 
and in taking heed thereto we have found it to be a 
light shining in a dark place : thus becoming the children 
of the light and the day, thereby claiming the 
promise that that day shall not overtake us as a thief. 

Dear brother, I believe that your visit was one of 
much profit to the brethren in this place. We all 
feel that our trials have been small when we hear 
what some of our elder brethren in the message have 
endured, in endeavoring to spread the truth. I believe 
we all feel strengthened and encouraged to press 
on with the hope and expectation that if we are deprived 
of your company here we shall enjoy it in the 
kingdom of God. 

Yours in love of the present truth.

### From Bro. Brown. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE:- I am still striving to keep 
the Sabbath holy. I am the only one in our family; 
and all that are any where near me, are against me; 
but by the help of Him who is ready and willing to 
help his people, I will stand the test. I want the 
prayers of God's people, that I may increase in faith 
and in the knowledge of the truth. 

July 15th and 16th, we had two very good meetings 
on Sabbath and First-day. Bro. Waggoner was 
our preacher. One sister went forward in the solemn 
duty of baptism. Myself and three others are 
all that there are in this town trying to keep the 
Sabbath and all the commandments. I see not much 
hopes of any more of this town ; but all who have 
commenced, hold out. 

I grow stronger every day ; and the more I read 
and the more they say to me, the greater is my faith. 
A man told me yesterday that he would complain 
of the first one that he saw breaking the first day of 
the week, or Sunday. But let him complain. They 
may put me in jail if they please; it is all evidence 
for me. No day passes but what I am opposed in 
some way. O that we could hear the truth preached 
every Sabbath. But we live in hope of better times. 

Yours in hope.

### From Sister Waldorf. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE :- Through the tender mercy 
of my heavenly Father I am still alive and enjoying 
the blessings of his bountiful hand. Of a truth there 
is a divine reality in religion, and none but those who 
are children of God, can fully realize and enjoy the 
blessed and glorious effects of revealed religion. Religion, 
what is it but the love of God dwelling in the 
soul? It is this that enables us to endure steadfast in 
the service of our heavenly Master. Experience  

teaches us that there is nothing of a worldly nature 
that can satisfy the mind. Nothing can fill the aching 
void and give substantial peace like this precious love. 
And this religion is revealed to us in the Bible; the 
blessed book of divine inspiration. O how good it is 
to have this book within our reach; for by it we 
learn the way of life and truth, and the glorious plan 
of salvation. It reveals to us the mind and will of 
our heavenly Father concerning us. It teaches us 
concerning the commandments of God, and our duty 
to obey in keeping them. 

It does seem to me that if we are truly consecrated 
to God as we should be, that it would be easy to 
keep his commandments. because they are not grievous; 
and if we are willing to know the truth as it is 
in Jesus, the Holy Spirit will reveal it, and cause us 
to know and understand our duty in all things; and 
though we may have many trials and temptations to 
endure, because we are striving to lay up a treasure 
in heaven, and truly desiring to show to all around, 
by our daily walk and chaste conversation, that we 
are the children of God; I say, what if we have to 
endure trials on this account, with the buffetings of 
Satan, let us trust in Jesus and he will bear us safely 
through ; and we shall gain the harbor at last. 
Let us continue to " watch and pray and exhort one 
another daily," living steadfast in the faith that we 
may be prepared for the glorious coming of our Lord. 
I am striving to keep the commandments of God and 
the faith of Jesus.

### From Sister Richmond. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE :- It is with pleasure we read 
the Review and feel to praise the Lord for the truth 
it contains. I have been a believer in the second 
coming of Christ nigh even at the doors ever since 
1843-4, and can truly say that my path is as a shining 
light that shineth more and more; and I hope 
that through the goodness and long-suffering of God, 
I shall be led in that straight and narrow path that 
leads to eternal life. Though almost all my friends, 
according to the flesh, think me very foolish, yet I 
feel that Jesus is a friend that sticketh closer than a 
brother. I praise the Lord that he has ever been 
mindful of so unworthy a creature as myself. My 
heart is cheered when I hear through the Review 
of the many that are being brought to the knowledge 
of the truth through the third angel's message. I believe 
that soon the number will be made up. and 
sealed with the seal of the living God. Shall I be 
one? My longing heart cries out, I must be one! 
I mean to strive, and by the help of Jesus, be among 
those that shall be redeemed from the earth. I want 
to be more like Jesus, and have the evidence from 
day to day that my ways please God. My dear 
brethren and sisters, let us be encouraged to leave 
the things that are behind, and reach forward to 
those things that are before. Let us press for the 
mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ 
Jesus. 

Evidences are fast thickening around us that tell 
that Jesus is soon coming. His work is almost done in 
the Sanctuary ; and then every case will be decided. 
O let us realize the time in which we live, and lay up 
our treasure in heaven. We need on the whole armor, 
that we may be able to stand in this evil time. 
Let us remember that Jesus hos overcome the world, the 
flesh, and the enemy. Praise his holy name, I mean 
to keep all the commandments of God and the testimony 
of Jesus, and overcome, and have right to the 
tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the 
city. 

Your unworthy sister, 

ELECTA RICHMOND.

### From Sister Day, 

DEAR BRO. WHITE:- I still feel like a pilgrim 
and a stranger here on earth, and I have no desire to 
call this earth mu home faits present sin-defiled state; 
but I trust, if I am faithful a little longer, I shall 
have a home in the beautiful New Earth, with all my 
Father's children, wherd there will be no more death, 
neither sorrow nor crying, neither will there be any 
more pain; for the former things will have passed 
away. How comforting are the precious promises given 
us in the word of troth. When weighed down with trials
and temptations the Word tells us,"There hath no 
temptation taken you but such as is common to man ; 
but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted 
above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation 
also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to 
bear it." It is true we have many trials to pass 
through, and we must expect to have them all the 
way along; but if we trust in the Lord, his grace 
will be sufficient for us, and we shall be able to live 
above them. 

It is cheering to me to hear from the brethren and 
sisters through the Review. I wish more of them 
would write. We are commanded to exhort one another
