# 6   THE HEALTH REFORMER

upon their observance; and second the 
pain aud disease caused by their infraction; 
the one enticing us to obedience, 
and the other being a powerful preventative 
of disobedience. 

This invention of reward and punishment 
evinces the wisdom and love of God. 
Without it the laws of our being would 
be powerless,--perfect mockery. Without 
it health would be a matter of uncertainty;
but now it is as certain as mathematics,
and the laws of attraction. We
can now trace health and disease to their 
true and respective causes. Like causes 
will always produce like effects. Obedience 
to the laws of our being will always 
produce health, while disobedience to 
these laws will as certainly produce disease.  
If we would enjoy health, whether 
we have lost it, or whether we posses it 
in a measure, we must obey. Obey 
and live, disobey and die. 

Tho laws of health are elucidated by 
the fact that they grow out of the relation 
that we sustain to those agencies upon 
which health and life depend. Among 
these agencies, food, air, light, temperature, 
clothing, bathing, exercise, and rest 
stand prominent. By properly relating 
ourselves to these agencies, we shall obey 
the laws of our being and have health; 
but by relating ourselves to them improperly 
we shall disobey these laws, and have 
pain, disease and death. 

From these principles it is evident that 
we cannot have health outside of obedience, 
any more than we can have pardon 
without repentance. This applies to the 
sick as well as to those who have health. 
In every case the law of God must be 
magnified. If the sick would have health, 
they must use those agencies which have 
a tendency to preserve health and life in 
a well man, and not those so-called remedies 
whic would make a well man sick.
Thus we see that the art curative is properly
the art preservative. In other words, 
in learning how to get well, we learn how 
to keep well after we have gotten health. 


From the connection that exists between 
health and the law of God, it is 
clear that the health question involves 
right and wrong, and should be made a 
matter of conscience. It is in viewing 
the subject from this standpoint, that we 
can see its true importance, and take a 
proper stand with reference to it. We 
should realize that, when we carelessly, 
and understandingly, violate the laws of 
our being, we sin against our own bodies, 

and against God, and shall be brought to 
an account sooner or later. 

Our happiness and usefulness depend 
greatly on health. It is when we have 
health that we can truly enjoy the blessings 
of this life, easily understand and appreciate 
the truth, and better live it out. 
And the healthier we are, the greater will 
be our usefulness; the more can we glorify 
God in our bodies and our spirits 
which are his. 

## Nothing but Water to Drink. 
## BY JOHN PIERPONT

When the bright morning-star the new daylight is
bringing, 
And the orchards and groves are with melody ringing, 
Their way to and from them the early birds winging, 
And their anthems of gladness and thanksgiving 
singing. 
Why do they so twitter and sing, do you think?
Because they've had nothing but water to drink! 

When a shower on a hot day of summer is over, 
And the fields are all scented with red and white clover, 
And the honey-bee -- busy and plundering rover --
Is fumbling the blossom-leaves over and over,
Why so fresh, clean, and sweet are the fields do you 
think? 
Because they've hod nothing but water to drink! 

Do you see that stout oak on the windy hill growing? 
Doo you see what great hailstones that black cloud is
throwing? 
Do you see that steam warship its ocea-way going?
Against trade-winds and head-winds, like hurricanes 
blowing? 
Why are oaks, clouds and steamships so strong do 
you think? 
Because they've had nothing but water to drink!

Now, if we have to work in the field, shop, or study, 
And would have a strong hand, and a face clean and 
ruddv, 
If we'd not have a head that is addled and muddy, 
With our eyes all bunged up, and our noses all bloody; 
How shall we make or keep ourselves so, do you think? 
Why, we must have nothing but water to drink! 

## HOW TO SAVE YOUR TEETH.
Mr. Beecher, who is something of a physician, 
as well as a theologian, author, lecturer, 
and reformer generally, says: 
"Our teeth decay. Hence, bad breath, 
unseemly mouth, and imperfect mastication. 
Every mouth regrets it. What is 
the cause? It is a want of cleanliness. 
A clean tooth never decays. The mouth 
is a warm place, ninety-eight degrees. 
Particles of meat between the teeth decompose. 
Gums and teeth must suffer. 
Cleanliness will preserve the teeth to old 
age. Use a quill pick, aud rinse the mouth 
after eating; brush with Castile soap every 
morning; brush with pure water on 
retiring. Bestow this trifling care upon 
your precious teeth, and you will keep
