# THE REVIEW AND HERALD.     7 

and so much the more as we see the day approaching; 
and what better way than through the 
Review? I think one must be blind indeed who cannot 
see the day approaching. But though darkness 
covers the earth, and gross darkness the geople, yet 
we are not in darkness that that that day should 
overtake us as a thief; therefore let us not sleep as 
do others, but let us watch and be sober. Let us 
not be weary in well-doing; for in due season we 
shall reap if we faint not. I am glad there have 
been such arrangements made about the paper. Let us 
all do our part toward sustaining it, that our faith 
may he manifested by our works ; for faith without 
works is dead, being alone. 

Yours striving to overcome. 

EMILY DAY.

### From Bro. Daniels. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE:- How plain it is to every 
discerning mind that the holy law of God is the 
seal of the living God, mentioned in Rev. vii, 2. 
Before the first-born in Egypt were slain, God's 
children had a mark upon their door-posts for a sign 
that the destroying angel might not come into their 
houses to destroy them. The blood was sprinkled 
upon their door-posts. The destroyer did not come 
to that house, but passed by it. 

This was their mark or sign. Those that had the 
mark were safe. Is not God's holy law the same to 
us as the passover was to them? I think it is. God 
is about to smite the land of Egypt with the seven 
last plagues; and before the four angels cease their 
holding, God's children must have a mark upon their 
door-posts, that no plague come nigh their dwelling ; 
for God says a thousand shall fall at thy side and 
ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come 
nigh thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy 
dwelling ; [Ps. xci, 7-10 ;] for his truth shall be thy 
shield and buckler; [verse 4;] and God's law is 
truth. Ps. cxix, 142. The angels are to hold the 
four winds until God's children are sealed with the 
seal of the living God in their foreheads. God's holy 
law is this seal. Isa. viii, 16, says, Bind up the 
testimony, seal the law among my disciples. Then 
we find in Deut. v and vi, that Moses, in giving his 
charge unto Israel before he died, puts them in mind of the ten commandments which God gave to them 
in Horeb, and he commands them to observe to do 
them, and not to turn to the right or to the left. 
Chap. vi. Now these are the commandments and 
statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God 
commanded, to teach you that ye might do them in 
the land whither ye go to possess it. That thou 
mightest fear the Lord thy God to keep all his statutes 
and his commandments which I commanded 
thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the 
days of thy life. and that thy days may be prolonged. 
Verse 4. Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God is 
one Lord. Verse 5. And thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy might. Verse 6-9. And these 
words which I command thee this day shall be in thy 
heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy 
children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in 
thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and 
when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, 
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes; 
[then it must be in their foreheads; so we see that 
the ten commandments are a sign in the forehead 
and in the hand-mark in the forehead or in the 
hand-third angel's message. Rev. xiv, 9] and thou 
shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and 
upon thy gates. 

The day of slaughter is at hand, when old and 
young are to be slain; [Eze. ix;] and the law of ten 
commandments is to be our shield and buckler, and 
frontlets between our eyes, that the slaughtering 
men may pass over us. O I do rejoice in the holy 
law of God: it has done a great work for me. 

Dear brethren and sisters, let nothing move you 
from the commandments of God and the testimony 
of Jesus. 

DEXTER DANIELS. 
Sandisfield, Mass., Aug. 5th, 1854. 

### From Bro. Cramer. 

DEAR BRO. WHITE :- We are still among the accountable 
beings of the world. Shut in as we are, 
we are trying to live out the truth of the third angel's 
message. There are truly many trials connected 
with our daily endeavors to do good to those 
around us, in presenting the truth to those we hope 
to benefit. The Timeists are how coming along 
with additional folly to their theory. They are presenting 
to the public that the 1335 days end the 19th 
of next May, and that "Blessed are they that wait 
and come to that time; for Daniel is to stand in his 
lot at that time. They contend that the law was 

abolished at the crucifixion; that the commandments 
could not he kept as God gave them, therefore Christ 
nailed them to his cross, and therefore Christ says, 
A new commandment I give unto you, that you love 
one another. This course they have to pursue in order 
to get rid of the third angel's message. 

The angel said to John, If any man shall take 
away from the words of the book of this prophecy, 
God shall take away his part out of the book of life, 
and out of the holy city. Rev. xxii, 19. Now men 
have the power to resist the truth; but like Jannes 
and Jambres their folly shall be manifest unto all 
men, as theirs also was. We hope the truth will 
shortly begin to take effect here. We have done 
what we could in our unworthy way. There has 
been no meeting here since last October. We have 
been almost discouraged, but we have continued to 
cry to God for help. He is our only help: thanks 
be to his ever blessed name. 

Bro. Holt called upon us on his way east. We 
were very glad to see him. We expect him to labor 
among us awhile, on his return from Vermont. O 
brethren pray for us here. We are glad to hear of 
the spread of the truth and its good effects in the 
West.

### Extracts of Letters. 

BRO. M. L. Dean writes from Ulysses Pa. Aug. 1st 
1854:- "The brethren here are all interested in reading 
the paper. The cause is prospering in this region. 
There seems to be a large field here ready for the harvest. 
Bro. Ingraham is doing what he can, but cannot 
supply the wants of the people." 

Bro. Luman Carpenter writes from Oswego, Aug. 3d 1854:- "I feel that the paper is a welcome messenger.
It is cheering to hear from the brethren and 
sisters from all parts of the field. May the Lord 
speed the paper, and the messengers ; for the harvest 
is fully ripe. I feel that union in the work of the 
Lord must prevail. Truth is strong and mighty. 
The Saviour says, Thy word is truth. The commandments 
of God and the faith of Jesus is the word 
by which God is purifying to himself a peculiar people. 
My prayer is, that I may receive benefit from 
its teachings, that I may be thorougly furnished unto
all good works. I am trying to do my whole duty. 
I want to be ready for the coming of the Lord, 
and his kingdom. I want a place there. Though I 
am unworthy and unprofitable, I hope through the 
merits of the Lamb of God to overcome, and so be 
forever with the Lord." 

Bro. Samuel Warner writes from Providence, R.I., 
Aug. 1st 1854:- "Blessed be God's holy name for 
his mercy to me in giving me to see and feel that it 
is a duty and pleasure to keep his commandments 
with the faith of Jesus. I do humbly pray for 
strength to resist all worldly influences, and to overcome 
all my sinful propensities and be completely 
reconciled to my God through Jesus Christ my righteousness, 
and wait with patience for his coming and 
kingdom. I tender my love to all brethren and sisters, 
who love the Lord. keep his commandments, and 
look with a lively faith for his soon coming; and I 
humbly trust that I may make one of the number 
who will be saved by grace and faith in his holy 
teachings." 

### OBITUARY. 

IN behalf of the deceased I would announce through 
the Review, the death of our beloved Sister. Charlotte 
Caroline Turner, who died of cholera at Madison, 
Wis., July 25th. The enemy overtook her 
when separated from her husband and home, and 
she fell beneath his fatal blow. 

In 1842, sister T. united with the the Baptist 
Church, and the following Spring she heard the proclamation 
of the first angel, which she gladly received, 
and was a firm believer in the second coming of our 
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, until the Spring of 
1851, when she saw that she was a transgressor of 
the fourth commandment. She was awakened to the 
danger of her situation by the voice of the third angel. 
Rev. xiv, 9-13. She received the message and 
embraced the present truth, and has since been striving 
to keep all the commandments, that she might 
have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the 
gates into the city." 

She left an afflicted husband and son, and a large 
circle of relatives and friends, who deeply fed their 
loss. But we trust they mourn not as those without 
hope. We would offer for their consolation the 
words of Paul, 1 Thess. iv, 13-18. How sweet the 
thought that our friends are asleep in Jesus, and  

that their sleep is blessed, verily. It seems they are 
taken from the evil to come. Blessed are the dead 
which die fn the Lord from henceforth ; yea, saith the 
Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and 
their works do follow them." 

How blest the state of all the righteous dead, 
Who holy lives of purity have led: 
From henceforth, saith the Spirit, yea, they rest 
From all their works, and are divinely blest. 

No more the Tempter's wiles, their feet shall snare; 
But sweetly sleeping, rest from all their care ; 
Calmly they wait the trumpet's solemn sound, 
Which wakes the sleeping saints, beneath the ground. 

Now bursts the fetters of the cheerless tomb, 
Awake to bright, to full, immortal bloom. 
Oh cruel grave ! thy boasted victory bring, 
And thou, O, tyrant death, where is thy sting! 

L. M. STEPHENSON. 

## SPIRITUALISM. 

"But there were false prophets also among the people, even 
as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily [Private 
Circles,] shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying 
the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift 
destruction." 2 Pet. ii, 1. "

When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction 
cometh upon them." 1 Thess. v, 3. 

"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the 
habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit," &c. 
Chap. xviii, 2. 

"Whose [Christ's] coming is after [immediately following] 
the working of satan with all power, and signs and lying wonders." 
2 Thess. ii, 9. 

"And shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that if 
it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." Matt. 
xxiv, 24. 

## Facts for Dr. Dods and Professor Faraday. 

The Society for the diffusion of Spiritual Knowledge are 
issuing a weekly in pursuance of their object, called the Christian 
Spiritualist. From it we take the following:-

. . "Again, we have had rapped out : 'lay fifty pieces 
of paper in a locked cupboard, and we will write upon them.' 
In less than half an hour there was a communication of at 
least ten lines on each piece, and each commuication perfectly 
characteristic of the individual professing to communicate. 

We have the remains of a table which was broken all to 
pieces by a. Spirit professing to be Samson of old-broken all 
in small pieces and not one person was near it. The table 
being near the wall, commenced moving as we came into the 
room to form a circle, and moved until I came to about the 
middle, when the Spirit commenced breaking it, and the floor 
when he got through, was a perfect sight to behold, all covered 
with splinters. The whole company, (sane ten or fifteen, 
all sceptics except myself,) were perfectly convinced." 

Were these men all "psycologized," Doctor'? Are the 
splinters, still kept, permanent phantoms engendered in the 
"back brain?" 

Whoever this Spirit is that assummes so strong a name, his 
deeds, we hope will testify that he has some right to it, either 
natural or acquired; and that he will keep on until he carries 
away the " brazen gates" of the Gaza, in which materialistic 
superstition has entrenched itself. 

A correspondent of the Christian Spiritualist writing from 
Washington, D. C., says:- It is gratifying to witness the 
steady and onward course of Spiritualism, and the intense 
anxiety of many persons to become acquainted with facts and 
witness the phenomena. In our city we have much greater 
interest awakened, than is generally known; many persons 
in high places are very much interested in the subject, but are 
afraid to have it understood that they should be guilty of such 
an enormity, which might be productive of a decree to hurry 
them to the Insane Asylum. After a while these fooleries 
will give way to the force of truth, and will be auxiliaries to 
the cause, which, at present, are like the viscus on the body 
politic. We thank God that the promise is even as it is. 
When we look back through the sins of years, since the introduction 
of this subject by Baron Swedenborg, and see its 
slow progress, we can hardly look without astonishment on 
the rapid and unprecedented advancement it has made in a 
short five years. Increasing in the same ratio, what may we 
expect in the neat ten? 

CARRIED BY AN INVISIBLE POWER :- P. B. Randolph stated, 
at the Conference of July 25th, that a gentleman of his 
acquaintance recently went into his parlor with a candle in 
his hand, intending to get for it a candlestick that was upon 
the parlor mantle-shelf He distinctly saw the candlestick 
upon the shelf as he went toward it, but before he got to it 
some one in the other room spoke to him, and he went back to 
answer the person who had spoken. As here-entered the parlor 
the candlestick which he had before distinctly seen was 
gone, and at that instant he heard it fall upon a trunk 
about thirty feet distant from the mentleplece where it bad 
before stood. There was no visible person any where near 
who could have moved it, and the only conclusion that seemed 
admissible was that it must have been moved by Spirit-agency. 

A writer to the Telegraph, says :- During a recent sitting 
at a private circle in your city, consisting of four persons besides 
myself, the following demonstrations occurred. In 
about five minutes after the circle was formed, I began to feel 
distinct touches from some object resembling a human hand ; 
these touches were first felt on the knee, then on the arm, and 
at last on the forehead. It was sufficiently light in the room 
to enable me to discern the movements of those who composed 
the circle, and I know as positively as I know that I 
am penning you this article, that I was touched by no mortal 
hand in the room.
