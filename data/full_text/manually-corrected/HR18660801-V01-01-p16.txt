# 16    THE HEALTH REFORMER. 

## Items for the Month.

THIS NUMBER. In many respects, we 
think no one will have reason to complain of the 
present number of The Health Reformer. Its 
neat and tasty typographical appearance will 
compare favorably with any magazine issued in 
the United States. The articles are replete with 
good instructions from the pens of careful writers 
and sound reasoners. Yet there are some disadvantages
under which we neccessarily labor in issuing 
a first number. An increased subscription 
list, and more extensive correspondence, will call 
in many things which will add greatly to the interest 
of our Journal. While therefore we shall 
endeavor to have future numbers as well filled 
with good instructive matter as the present, we 
shall aim to present a still greater variety. 

LATE. Disappointment in obtaining material 
for the Reformer from the type foundry, 
has delayed this number about two weeks. We 
shall try to be more prompt in future. 

A WORD TO CONTRIBUTORS. Those who 
have so promptly and generously contributed 
their valuable thoughts for this number of the 
Reformer, have our sincere thanks. We hope for 
a continuance of their favors, and trust that many 
others will join the ranks, and speak through our 
columns in favor of the true philosophy of life. 
We woudl say to all, that wedesign to have the 
September number cut on time, and shall want 
their contributions as soon as possible.

OUR WORK. We do not enter the field of 
Health Reform, to operate against any other 
Health Institution, to underrate the efforts of any 
other class of health reformers, or to decry other 
Health Journals. The field is large, adn there is 
room for all the effort that is likely to be put 
forth in this direction for some time to come. 
All therefore, who are laboring to mitigate the 
evils that result from the present prevalent false 
habit of life, we bid God speed in their noble
work, and hope by our efforts, to aid somewhat in 
the much-needed labor in this direction.

WE send this number to many who are not 
yet subscribers to this Journal, and whom we 
hereby earnestly invite to become such. The 
next number we shall send to actual subscribers 
only.

SEVERAL earnest friends of the health reform,
have already written us, promising to lend 
us their efforts in procuring subscribers for the 
Reformer. Such have our thanks. Their efforts 
will be appreciated. Specimen numbers will be 
sent on application to all who may wish them in 
obtaining subscribers.



THE WESTERN HEALTH REFORM INSTITUTE. 
In addition to The buildings already on the grounds
purchased for this Institution, we have been 
obliged to erect a building for a reservoir, bath, 
dressing, and pack rooms.  This is rapidly going 
forward; and the Institution will be open for patients
by the 5th of September next. For further 
particulars, see circular.

CIRCULARS. Those of our subscribers 
who feel interested in Health Institutions, where 
the sick are treated Hygienically, are requested
to send for our circular to exhibit to their friends.
They can be had gratuitously.

ADVERTISEMENTS. We will admin into 
our columns a limited number of advertisements,
of a proper character, at reasonable rates.

THE subject of Diet is in these days no 
less important than it was in the days of Adam; 
and it was so important then, that nearly one 
half the instruction which God gave to him of 
which we have any record, had reference to this 
subject.  See Gen. i, 29.

A SOOTHER. A Detroit pork dealer, with 
a keen eye to trade, thus attempts to quiet the 
fears of his customers in regard to pork-eating: 

"No Trichinæ. I hereby inforn, my friends 
and customers, that by instructions received from
Dr. Kiefer, and by application of a powerful microscope,
I am able to furnish only perfectly 
sound and healthy pork." 

The microscope probably cures! 

A FRIEND sending a subscriber for the 
Reformer, writes: 

DR. LAY, Feeling interested in your new enterprise,
I have taken it upon myself to get subscribers 
for your paper. I have got one, and will send 
it in. I feel confident that success will attend 
your efforts. I shall try to get several more next 
month, and shall send in soon for ourselves.

We thank our fiend for help promised, and 
the words of encouragement given. We too have 
perfect confidence in the success of the enterprise.
It certainly cannot fail if many co-workers come 
to our aid, bringing the same earnestness that is 
expressed by those who have already responded.

PORK. An English paper says the trichinæ 
cannot live at the temperature of boiling water, 
so that through cooking, by boiling of infected 
pork, is all that is required to render it harmless.
This reminds The Hartford Press of the old lady's 
advice, "Always eat your chestnuts biled, my 
son, biled worms don't hever hurt nobody."

A FRENCH writer has said that, "to dream 
gloriously, you must act gloriously while you are 
awake; and to bring angels down to converse 
with you in your sleep, you must labor in the 
cause of virtue during the day."
