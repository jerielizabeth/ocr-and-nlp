## Questions & Answers.

QUESTION.

S. H. N. inquires:

"I have a boy, 3 years of age, who is troubled 
with a small swelling on the neck, under the ear. 
Sometimes it nearly disappears, at other times it 
increases in size, but does not appear to be much 
sore or painful. 1st, What is it? 2nd. How 
shall I treat it?" 

ANS. 1. It is a Scrofulous enlargement 
of one of the cervical glands. 
2. Mark out a simple and regular plan 
of life for him, letting him spend a very 
large portion of his time out of doors, 
keeping him warmly clad, especially the 
extremities. Let his diet be simple 
and unstimulating, giving him no condiments
or greasy food. Have him retire early 
at night, aud every day about noon lie 
down at least one hour. Once or twice 
a week, at 11 o'clock A. M., wash off the 
entire body thoroughly in soft water at 
90 deg. leaving him dry and warm after 
the bath. 

QUESTION.

Mr. J. B. O. says: 

"Every summer I become bilious, my skin assuming 
a yellow appearance. I also feel gloomy 
and melancholy at times. I live on simple food, 
and work hard twelve or fourteen hours per day, 
and frequently plan much of my busiress after I 
retire at night. My sleep is disturbed, and I am 
some nervous. Lately I am constantly troubled 
with a sorenes in my chest. 

I have not the means to go to a Water-Cure. 
What can I do at home that will benefit me?" 

ANS. In the first place no one can long 
retain his health, living as unphysiologically
as you do in regard to labor, rest, 
&c. The human orgarnism cannot endure  
such severe taxation. At most you should 
not work more than eight hours per day, 
and should recreate an hour or two each 
day. You should eat but two meals a 
day and nothing between meals. Let 
your diet consist of unleavened graham 
bread, graham puddmg, frutts and simply-
cooked vegetables. Retire at 8 P.M. and 
rise at 5 A.M. Be happy, cheerful, and 
contented. Once a week, on a regular 
day, at 11 A.M. take a thorough sponge 
bath at 85 or 90 deg. And once a week
take a Sitz-bath at 90 deg., five minutes,
85 deg., ten minutes. At night wear
the abdominal badge, wet in front,
with a dry one over it. Breathe full 
and deep so as to freely use the abdominal 
muscles. 

QUESTION.

J. L. M., Allegan Co., Mich., asks:

1. "Which is the best food, wheat or corn?"

ANS. Both are very good, but wheat
has the preference.

2. "Should wheat be ground coarse or fine?"

ANS. It should be ground fine; the 
finer teh better, but not one particle of 
the bran should be separated from it.

## Something for Pork-Eaters

To those who are incredulous in regard 
to the Trichina disease, we would commend 
a careful consideration of the following 
well-authenticated facts. D. T. 
Shireman writing from Marion, Iowa, 
says:

"I wish to say that the pork disease is 
in our city. Some have died, and others 
are in a situation that they cannot recover. 
The circumstances are these: A family 
residing in this place had two hams 
brought to them by some of their own relatives, 
about the first of May. Some time 
after, a number of the family were taken 
sick. Last Friday, the 2d day of June, 
oen child, 11 years old, died; and Saturday,
the 3d, a young man about 23 years 
old died, both suffering dreadfully. At 
the present the father and one child are 
alive, but cannot live long. The mother 
and one child and a son, a young man, 
are very poorly. I understand that some 
others have been afflicted with the same 
disease. On examination of some of the 
flesh of the first boy that died, they estimated 
that there were about two hundre 
and sixty tousand of the trichina in a 
cubic inch."

Another gentleman by the name of Wesley
Hoff, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in confirmation 
of the above, writes under date 
of June 11, that "two of the fmaily have 
died, and that other members of the family 
are conscious of being eaten up by 
millions of worms, and are expected to 
die." He further states taht Dr. May,
of Cedar Rapids, has examined the flesh 
of one of the persons that died from the 
effects of the trichina, and counted one 
hundred and four worms in a piece not as 
large as a grain of wheat!
