## Results of Moderation in Diet. 

DR. LAY: The following, which I have 
taken from an old newspaper, may be of 
interest to the readers of the HEALTH REFORMER.
A. C. BOURDEAU 

"Health anu longevity are not the only 
results of moderation in diet. Its influence 
is far from being limited to the body; 
its effects on the mind are still more important. 
Julius Cesar, constitutionally 
addicted to excess, when resolved on some
great exploit was accustomed to diminish 
his diet to an extent truly marvelous, and 
to this diminution he ascribed the clearness 
and energy of mind which distinguished
him in the hour of battle. 

"When extraordinary mental vigor was 
desired by the first Napoleon, he used the 
same means to attain it. To bis rarely- 
equaled moderation in diet, Dr. Franklin 
ascribed his 'clearness of ideas,' and 
'quickness of perception,' and considered
his progress in study proportionate to 
the degree of temperance which he practiced.
While Sir lsaac Newton was composing 
his 'Treatise on Optics,' he confined 
himself to bread and a little sack 
and water. Scarcely less rigid was the 
abstinence of Leibnitz, when preparing 
some parts of his 'Universal Language.' 
D' Aubigne relates of Luther on the authority 
of Melancthon, that 'a little bread 
and a single herring were often his only 
food for a day.-Indeed, he was constitutionally 
abstemious, and even after he had 
found out that Heaven was not to be purchased
by abstinence, he often contented 
himself with the poorest food, and would 
continue for a considerable time without 
eating or drinking.' Dr. Cheyne, a celebrated 
physician, reduced himself from 
the enormous weight of 448 pounds to 
140 pounds, by confining himself to a limited
quantity of vegetables, milk and water, 
as his only food and drink. The result 
was a restoration of health and mental 
vigor-and, amid professional and literary 
labors, uninterrupted health, and  
protracted life. An eminent man once 
made the remark that 'nobody ever reprented
having eaten too little."

As you desire peace of mind and temporal 
happiness, preserve your health.
