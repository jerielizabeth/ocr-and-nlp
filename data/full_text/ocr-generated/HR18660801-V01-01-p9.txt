'fhe Lor1l has sometimes 
interposed his power to save foob, from the 
effects of their folly. 
"Fools bec:rnse of their 
trausgression, and because of their iniquities, 
are afflicted. Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; 
and tlicv draw near unto the 
gates of death. ·Then they cry unto the Lord in 
theii' t,rouble, and he 
saveth them out of 
their distresses. He sent his 
word and healed them, 
and rleliverC>d them from

But dot,s tlie Lord wish to encourage us to 
continue in om· "transgression" and jn our "iniquities," with the hope that 
he will always p:1rdon even onr willin~, if not 
willfol, tn.11sgressions? No! The

nature's laws is the Author of the 
ten commandments. It is 
sin to late either of these codes.

into trouble expect the Lord to heal us,

BY J<Lll. J. N. ANDREWS. \Vhat rlid tlie Author of our being 
sign as fooll for mankind? This question 
is 11ot unworthy 
the thought.fol inquiry of 
our race. Observation will convince any 
candid man that 
one of the most frequent 
causes of ,fo1ease is to be found in 
what is taken into the stomach. Yet most 
ple seem wholly unaware of the 

taucc of attention 
w this i,,ubject, aud act as though it 
was a ma,tter quite unworthy 
of their 
con~ideration. Such should 
not be the case with the Christian. He is 
strictly enjoined to glorify God in eating 
and drinking as well as in every other act 
of his 
life. To do thi~ is to regard the laws of 
our being ancl to nso such footl as shall best promote health 
a,nd strength, freedom from disease, clearness of 
mind, and cheerfulness and serenity of spirit. 
Health is a Christian duty, and sickness, 
as tlie result of a violation of the 
laws of our own 
nature, a sin against God. An 
enfeebled, diRcased person will exhibit at 
best an enfeebled, sickly 
experience in the religion of Christ. The gloom 
and thropy of tho 
dyspeptic will appear in 
most eveTy part of 
his Christhu ence. His will be 
a dyspeptic religion full of gloom to 
hiuisclf, much of which 
he will attribute to Satan, 
when he ought 
in justice to divide the blame 
b,:tween himself and Satan; taking to himself the 
responsibility of 
yielding to a 
depraved appetite, and attributing to the Arch-fiend 
the quite unnecessary part of tempting 
that appetite to its 
accustomed use of 
wholesome food. Such an experience will 
be foll of 
sadness and distre;;s, a life-long burden to 
its possessor, and not 
qnently a serious source of grief to his 
dearest religious friends. 
Dyspepsia, the fruitful sonrce of many evil diseases, 
is the direct result of trausgression 
in the u~e of food. No person under 
its power is in a condition to glorify God 
as he should. The Author of man's being 
signed that he should 
possess health, clearness of mind, and strength of body. 
These exeelleut proJJcrties consecrated to 
the seJ"Vice of God 
and of humanity, are 
of incalc.ufablc value to him that 
would glorify God in 
his body, and in his spirit. 
To be 
deprived of these, is generally 
at least, a great calamity, and not 
quently it 
is largely attrilmtable to our 
own trnnsgrcssions in the use of food. 

Those who devote 
themselves to the 
vice of God cannot too deeply feel that 
what they 
give to him should be the best 
that they have; and that they who 
sent themselves to God with 
every power of body 
:md mind enfeebled, offer to him 
at best but a lan1e sacrifice. If we have 
health it is 
a religious duty that we 
serve it; if we are feeble 
and clcbilitaterl, then it 
is obligatory in the highest degree 
that we shouhl, if possible, recover our 
health ana stren~h, that we may devote 
these to the 
service of the God of 
en. Cease to do 
evil and learn to do 
well, is a direction quite 
as important in its 
bearing, when referred to the 
laws of our 
being as to the 
wi;tten law of God. 
But it is the object of this article to 
fer a 
few thoughts relative to flesh as food 
for man. 
That God for wise rnasons has given man 
permission to eat the flesh of 
animals is not denied. But it is certain 
that in the beginning it 
was not so. When 
God placed man in 
Paradise and 
ed on him every blessing 
thrrt could make life desirable, he by law ilesignated the
