Vol. 1, No. 6. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 45. moral powers, Satan well knows that his power to overcome with his temptations is very small. In our day people talk of the dark ages, and boast of progress. But with this progress wick-edness and crime do not decrease. We deplore the absence of natural simplicity, and the in-crease of artificial display. Health, strength, beauty and long life, which were common in the so-called " dark ages," are rare now. Nearly every thing desirable is sacrificed to meet the demands of fashionable life. A large share of the Christian world have no right to call themselves Christians. Their hab-its, their extravagance, and general treatment of their own bodies, are in violation of physical law, and contrary to the Bible standard. They are working out for themselves, in their course of life, physical suffering, and mental and moral feebleness. Through his devices, Satan has, in many re-spects, made domestic life one of care and com-plicated burdens, in order to meet the demands of fashion. His purpose in doing this is to keep minds occupied so fully with the things of this life that they can give but little attention to their highest interest. Intemperance in eating and in dressing has so engrossed the minds of the Christian world that they do not take time to become intelligent in regard to the laws of their being, that they may obey them. To pro-fess the name of Christ is of but little account, if the life does not correspond with the will of God, revealed in his word. In the wilderness of temptation Christ over came on man's behalf on the point of appetite. His example of self denial, and self control, when suffering the gnawing pangs of hunger, is a re-buke to the Christian world for their dissipa-tion and gluttony. There is at; this time nine times as much money expended for the gratifi-cation of appetite, and to indulge foolish and hurtful lusts, as there is given to advance the gospel of Christ. Were Peter upon the earth now he would exhort the professed followers of Christ to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. And Paul would call upon the churches in general to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. And Christ would drive from the temple those who are defiled by the use of tobacco, polluting the sanctuary of God by their tobacconized breaths. He would say to these worshipers, as he did to the Jews, " My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves." We would say to such, your unholy of-ferings of ejected quids of tobacco defile the temple, aind are abhorred of God. Your worship is not acceptable, for your bodies which should be the temple for the Holy Ghost are defiled. You also rob the treasury of God of thousands of dollars through the indulgence of unnatural appetite. If we would see the standard of virtue and godliness exalted ; as Christians, we have a work devolving upon us individually to control ap-petite, the indulgence of which counteracts the force of truth, and weakens moral power to resist and overcome temptation. As Christ's follow-ers we should, in eating and drinking, act from principle. When we obey the injunction of the apostle, " Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God," thousands of dollars which are now sacrificed upon the altar of hurtful lust will flow into the Lord's treasury, multiplying publications in dif-ferent languages to be scattered like the leaves of Autumn. Missions will be established in other nations, and then will the followers of Christ be indeed the light of the world. The adversary of souls is working in these last days with greater power than ever before to ac-complish the ruin of man through the indul-gence of appetite and passions. And many who are held by Satan under the power of slavish appetite are the professed followers of Christ. They profess to worship God, while appetite is their god. Their unnatural desires forŁ these in-dulgences are not controlled by reason or judg-ment. Those who are slaves to tobacCo will see their families suffering for the conveniences of life, and for necessary food, yet they have not the power of will to forego their tobacco. The clamors of appetite prevail over natural affec-tion. Appetite, which they have in common with the brute, controls them. The cause of Christianity, and, even humanity would not in any case be met, if dependent upon those in the habitual use of tobacco and liquor. If they had means to use only in one direction, the treasury of God would not be replenished, but they would have their tobacco and liquor. The to-bacco idolator will not deny his appetite for the cause of God. It is impossible for these to realize the bind- ing claims and holiness of the law of God. The brain and nerves are deadened by the use of this narcotic. They cannot value the atonement or appreciate the worth of immortal life. The in-dulgence of fleshly lusts wars against the soul. The apostle in the most impressive language ad-dresses Christians, "I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God." If the body is saturated with liquor and the defilement of tobacco, it is not holy and acceptable to God ? Satan knows that it cannot be, and for this reason he brings his temptations to bear upon men upon the point of appetite that he may bring them into bondage to this propensity and thus work their ruin. The Jewish sacrifices were all examined with careful scrutiny to see if any blemish was upon them, or if they were tainted with disease. The least defect or impurity was sufficient reason for the priests to reject them. The offering must be sound and valuable. The apostle has in view the requirements of God upon the Jews in their offerings when he in the most earnest manner appeals to his brethren to present their bodies a living sacrifice. Not a diseased, decaying of-fering, but a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. How many come to the house of God in fee-bleness, and how many come defiled by the in-dulgence of their own appetite ! Those who have degraded themselves by wrong habits, when they assemble for the worship of God, give forth such emanations from their diseased bodies as to be disgusting to those around them. And how offensive must this be to a pure and holy God. A large proportion of all the infirmities that afflict the human family are the results of their own wrong habits, because of their willing igno-rance, or of their disregard of the light which God has given in relation to the laws of their being. It is not possible for us to glorify God while living in violation of the laws of life. The heart cannot possibly maintain consecration to God while the lustful appetite is indulged. A diseased body and disordered intellect, because of continual indulgence in hurtful lust, make sanctification of the body and spirit impossible. The apostle understood the importance of the healthful conditions of the body for the success-ful perfection of Christian character. He says, " I keep under my body, and bring it into sub-jection ; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away." He mentions the fruit of the Spirit, among which is temperance. " And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the af-fections and lusts." Men and women indulge appetite at the ex-pense of health and the enfeebling of the intel-lect, so that they cannot appreciate the plan of salvation. What appreciation can such have of the temptation of Christ in the wilderness, and the victory he gained upon the point of ap-petite. It is impossible for them to have exalt-ed views of God, and to realize the claims of his law. The proposed followers of Christ are for-getful of the great sacrifice made by him on their account. The Majesty of Heaven, in order to bring salvation within their reach was smitten, bruised, and afflicted. He became a man of sor-row and acquainted with grief. In the wilder-ness of temptation he resisted Satan, although the tempter was clothed with the livery of Heav-en. Christ, although brought to great physical suf-fering, refused to yield on a single point, not-withstanding the most flattering inducements were presented to bribe and  influence him to yield his integrity. All this honor, all this riches and glory said the deceiver, will I give thee if thou wilt only acknowledge my claims. Christ was firm. Oh ! where would now be the salvation of the race if Christ had been as weak in moral power as man ? No wonder that joy filled Heaven as the fallen chief left the wilderness of temptation a conquered foe. Christ has power from his Father to give his di-vine grace and strength to manŠmaking it pos-sible for him through his name, to overcome. There are but few professed followers of Christ who choose to engage with him in the work of resisting Satan's temptation as he resisted and overcome. Professed Christians, who enjoy gatherings of gaiety, pleasure and feasting, cannot appreciate the conflict of Christ in the wilderness. This great example of their Lord in overcoming Sa-tan is lost to them. This infinite victory which Christ achieved for them in the plan of salva-tion is meaningless. They see no special inter-est in the wonderful humiliation of our Saviour and the anguish and sufferings he endured for sinful man, while Satan was pressing him with his manifold temptations. The scene of trial  with Christ in the wilderness was the founda-tion of the plan of salvation, and gives to fallen man the key whereby he, in Christ's name, may overcome. Many professed Christians look upon this por-tion of the life of Christ as they would upon a common warfare between two kings, and as hav-ing nw special bearing upon their own life and character. Therefore the manner of warfare, and the wonderful victory gained, have but little interest for them. Their perceptive powers are blunted by Satan's artifices, so that they cannot discern that he who afflicted Christ with maid-fold temptations in the wilderness, determining to rob him of his integrity as the Son of the In-finite, is to be their adversary to the end of time. Although he failed to overcome Christ, his pow-er is not weakened over man. All are person-ally exposed to the temptations that Christ over-came, but strength is provided for them in the all powerful name of the great conquerer. And all must, for themselves, individually overcome. Many are assailed and fall under the very same temptations wherewith Satan assailed Christ. Appeal to the California Brethren. Dear Brethren and Sisters :ŠThe Lord, in permitting us to see the light of present truth, has laid great responsibilities upon us, to use the utmost of our ability in extending the light of this truth to others. We publish these few lines to call your attention to a few facts, and to appeal to you in regard to duty. A good work has been done in planting the standard of truth upon this coast. At our camp meeting last fall, the Spirit of the Lord stirred us up mightily to the importance of more ex-tended efforts to spread the truth. Since then it has seemed apparent to your State Committee, and the laborers on this coast, that the time had come when there should be a paper published in the interest of the cause here. Bro. White made propositions to our State Committee to start a paper here. Our State Committee did not feel like taking the respon-sibility of starting the paper. Bro. White has since commenced the publication of the SIGNS OF THE TIMES, with the understanding, however, that our people here desired such a paper. He has called on the brethren in all parts to send in subscriptions and pledges for the SIGNS. The brethren east of the plains express a willingness to raise means to help in starting the press here, if the brethren on this coast manifest a corres-fponding zeal in the work. In establishing the press here, of course more in proportion would naturally be expected of the brethren on this coast, than of the brethren in any distant lo-cality. A great interest has been taken in the estab-lishing of the SIGNS OF THE TIMES here, by our eastern brethren, both in furnishing lists of subscribers, and in pledging means. This, in itself, is a proof of the unbounded confidence of the eastern brethren in Bro. White, and in any moves he may decide to make for the advance-ment of the cause. Their acquaintance with his past course has given them confidence ; seeing that such moves are not made by him without deep thought, humble, earnest prayer, and mov-ing in the fear of God, and seeing the success crowning such movements, gives them confi-dence. Brother White, who is now in the East, ex-presses to us a willingness to return and run the paper here, and spend another winter upon this. coast in publishing the SIGNS OF THE TIMES, provided there is a lively interest taken in giv-ing him a list of subscribers on this coast. A call has been made to know what you are willing to do. A few have responded. There are more that should be acting, and sending subscribers, and making their pledges. Are our missionary officers in each church looking after such cases, and getting pledges of $100 men to establish the press, and pledges and donations to the SIGNS ? Are each one of you, individu-ally, active in getting persons to subscribe to the SIGNS, according to the plan proposed in No. 5 ? Now is our time brethren and sisters to act. If we are not mistaken there are sev-eral of our sisters on this coast who would be blessed of the Lord in paying $100 each to es-tablish the press here. Let such respond. Bro. White does not hold the people in Cali-fornia responsible for what he has done in start-ing the SIGNS OF THE TIMES. He has assumed all the responsibility, and made the fullest prom-ises to California for what they do in the matter whenever we get ready to act in starting a Pub-lishing Association here. Bro. White is surely left in a condition to act from his own sense of duty. That sense of duty, relative to the SIGNS OF THE TIMES, will undoubtedly be governed  very much by the way we act, and by the zeal we manifiest here. Shall we respond to his call ? Different ones will perhaps plead poverty and make excuses. Some indeed are poor. All are not. Do you realize what was done in early times of this cause to start the work ? Several men in the East sold their farms and lifted nobly with their means to establish the press, and publish the truth. It told mightily. God blessed them. They have never come to want for it, and now have the blessed consolation that such investments are "bags in Heaven." When the press was established in Battle Creek, four men came forward and furnished means and put up a building in which to publish the Review and Herald, and books. They were not rich men by any means, but they were men who had the cause of God at heart. There are more than one score on this coast better able to give $100 each towards establishing a press here than these men were to do what they did. The ques-tion we put to you is, will you do.  it ? Make your pledges immediately. State what you can pay on,your pledges in 1874, and what in 1875. Plan for the cause of God. Watch for lawful opportunities to gain means to advance the cause, and God will open ways before you. Frompersonal knowledge of one of the Confer-ence Committee, we can say that our people on this coast are just as able to do as those eastern breth-ren who are pledging to the press here. They make their pledges, and then study economy and self denial, that they may advance the cause of God, and the Lord can in such a course bless their lawful efforts to obtain means. He will do the same for us here, if we give him a chance to work for us. What shall we do ? It will not do for us to settle down with the idea that the Lord has favored us with much talent in the ministry, and a paper in our midst, and that we have not much to do, and may bury ourselves up in our cares and give what we can spare as well as not, without Making any particular sac-rifice of time, means or effort on our part. If we do thus, we may be aroused sometime to find the ministerial talent gone to other fields, and we left to realize and feel a sense of our own burdens and duties. Shall we be fully awake to the golden oppor-tunity we now have to act ? This matter must come up in our California camp meeting. In order that it may come up right we ask you each, individually, to respond to this call. Let the officers of the churches and Missionary 'So-ciety on this coast move. Get pledges of $100 men and women, and pledges for the SIGNS. Act upon these suggestions. Please act immedi-ately, and write to J. N. Loughborough, St. Helena, Napa Co., Cal., giving the result of your efforts. CAL. CONF. COM. The Old Way. Fox about thirty years we have unwaveringly believed that, in the most emphatic sense, "the end of all things is at hand." This belief has not been founded on the opinions of men, but by much prayerful searching of the Scriptures. To expect to know the day or hour, or even the year, of the coming of Jesus in the clouds of heaven, we have never thought to be within the province of other than the great Eternal. But that the humble Bible student may, by care-ful reliance on the teachings of the Word, and observance of the times, know when the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and is even at the very doors, is a truth too palpable to require com-ment. See Matt. 14 : 29-33. That he will come again we know, because there is not a more explicit, uncontrovertible declaration within the lids of the Bible than this..  Why should not Christians of the present day be like the Christians of nearly two thousand years since ? So greatly did the Christians of Thessalonica long for the speedy coming of their Lord, that instead of putting it off " thousands on thousands of ages hence," as did a teacher in Israel with whom we were conversing, their al-most impatient desires inclined them to thinkit must be immediate. If the joyous anticipations of the return of the Son of Man should so fill the mind's vision of of the early church nearly two thousand years ago, how should the vision of th'e believers of the present day be occupied with the subject !ŠGuide to Holiness.
