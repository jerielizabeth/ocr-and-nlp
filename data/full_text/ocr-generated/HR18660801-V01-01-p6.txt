upon their 
observance; and second the pain aud disease caused by 
theit· tion; t.he one enticing us to obedience, 
and the other being 
a powerful preventŁ 
ive of 
<li8obedience. This invention of 
reward and ment evinces the wisdom and love of Go<l. 
\Yithout it the 
laws of onr 
being would be powerle~s,-perfect mockery. out it health 
woul<l be a matter of 
tainty; but uow 
it is as certain as matici., and the laws of attraction. \V c can now 
trace health and 
disease to their 
tr1\e aml respective causes. Like causes 
will always protlucc like effects. 
ence to the 
laws of our being will always produce health, while disobedience to 
thc~e laws will 
us certainly procfoee ease. If we 
would eujoy health, whether 
we have lost it, or whether ,ve pot-scss it in il mCa$nte, we must obey. Obey 
and live, disobey and ,lie. Tho lawi-of health 
arc elucidated by the fact that they 
grow out of the 
relation that we !\ustain to those agencies upon which health )).lid life depenrl. Among these agencies, food, air, light, ture, clothing, bathing, exercise, and rest staud prominent. Ry properly relating onrsel ves to these 
a.genciei-, we shall obey 
the laws of our heitig 
and have health; but by 
relatin~ onr~elves to them 
erly we shall 
rlisohey theRc laws, and have pain, disease and <ieath. From these principles it is 
evident that we cannot have health out:;iide of obedi. ence, any more than we can have pardon without repentance. This applies to the 
sick as well as to tho~e who have health. In every ca~c the law of God must be magnified. If the sick 
would have hca}th, they must 
use those agencies which 
have a tendency to presen·e health and life in a well man, a.nd not those 
tio-culletl dies \\·hich woula make a well mau sick. 'fl1us we see that the art curative i~ f>rly the art preservative. In other words, in learuing how to get well, 
we learn how 
to keep well after we lia.ve gotten health. 
:Fron\ the connection that 
exists twl'Cn health and the 
law of God, it is 
clear that the health question 
involve!! right alld wrong, a111l should he 
made a matter of 
conscience. It is in viewing 
the ,;ubject from this standpoint, that we 
c:m see its trne importance, 
and take a prOJJer stand with reference to it. \Ve 
should realize that, 
when we carelessly, antl understandingly, violate the 
laws of our being, we sin 
against our own bodies, and against God, and shall be brought to 
an account 
sooner or later. 
Our happiness 
autl usefulness depend greatly on health. It 
is when we have 
h('alth"that we can truly 
enjoy the ings of 
this Efe, easily understand and preciate the truth, and 
bPtkr live it out. 
And the healthier we are, the 
greater will he our 
usefnlness; the more 
cao we 
rify God in our bodies 
and our spiritti which are his. 
Nothing but Water
