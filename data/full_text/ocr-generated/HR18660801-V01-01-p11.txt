l.l. than the owners proceed to fatten and kill 
them for the market. 
Particularly is this 
the ca~e in all swellings, sores, and 
other marks of scroful:i in these creatures. 
7. Animals not 
originally diseased are necessarily made such by the fatte11ing 
proceRs. Deprived of exercise, 
and ed to 
eat far beyond the wants of nature, 
they become in 
due time a 
mass of 
eased fat., and then they are just fit to be 
slaughtered for the 
food of man. 
8. Could we 1-1uppose them to 
cscnpe disease iu 
the fattening process, (which 
few if auy do), the most of the beef in the 
market is the 
flesh of animals 
transported humln~us of miles on the cars, and 
ed to s ntfer 
from excessive thirst and from 
the painful sit11ation 
in which they are 
compelled to 
ride on the cars, and from 
want of air till 
they are brought into a 
state of 
liigh fever, and then in the very 
act of being slaughtered are maddened 
anrl inforiated by the treatment they 
ceive, and by what thoy see. Does not 
reason teach tiiat it would be 
" expedient" to let 
:mch kinds of food 
be eaten by those 
who will have it? 
9. '\Ve live in 
a time when new and 
heard-of diseases are spreading among the 
domestic animals of every 
kinu. Is it not 
safest t-0 let their flesh cease to be 
a part of our food? 
l 0. 
These creatures obtain their flesh 
to a great extent from 
the fruits and 
grains. \V ould it not be 
as well for us to cat these 
befol'e these creatures do it, 
as afterward? 
Norridgewock, }Ile., July 9, 1866. Is ANIMAL FooD NiwEss.ARY ?-)Ir. Curling, sevenroeen years an agent on the 
Devon estate in Ireland, 1;ays: 
"There ru·e 6,680 persons on the estate. 
They are energetic, 
moral, and haved. I do not remember a 
crime in seventeen years, not even so much as 
stealing a chicken. 
They are a contented, grateful people-grateful even for fair 
play. Otit of six hundred farmers, deduct 
fifty, aml the rest do not see a wheaten 
loaf, or 
smell meat, except at Christmas 
and Easter. They 
have been brought up 
to this custom. One tenant on the Devon 
estate I have seen 
sit down to potatoes, 
buttermilk and Indian meal, who 
chased at 
a recent sale 
£10,000 worth of 
property, and did not have to 
borrow a shilling to 
pay for it. 
I believe this to 
be the usual mode of living 
in Limerick." . How t.o Be Sick, BY C, l\L WILLTR. We've rend how we ought to keep 
healthy, Enough u large volume to 
fill; I now 
will present a new subject, ny telling you 
how to be 
ill. Never bathe in a 
drop of cnld 
l<nter, For fear it 
may make you tnk~ cold, By looacning tho Łhell wbich encrusts you, And mnke you feel 
sHft'eued and old. Eat plenty of pork in hot weather, 
.A nil vegetables f!Wimming in grea:Se; {lf sodn, and biscuit, and 
pMtry, Eat freely, a~ much as 
you please. If one should auggesl that 'tis hurtful, Treat all 5!Uch a.Q ~ice with a fmeer, Just tell them you work for 
a living, You'll havŁ it loo, while you 
St"-y her~. If it brings on a pain in your stomach, Proct1re ~ome fine~cut and a pipe, Tobacco is good for dyspepsia, 
Tben use it from morning 
till night. And now nnd 
then drink some drugged liquor, 
Nor mind if 
teetotaler~ scold, 'T,vill drive out the heat in the 
s11 mmer, In winter 'twill keep out the cold. 
And when y(l<t retire, close the 
windows, Exclude all the evening oir quite, Draw closely the curtains around you, And thus P""" the hours of tbe night; 
Then stupid 
and dull in the morning, 
Craw 1 languidly out of your 
bed, Drink a cup uf strong tea or of coffee, 
To ease the 
sharp pa.in in your head, Keep storming and scolding at 
trifles, No matter where blame ma,y belong, All accid~ntH lay on to some one, 
Thou~h no one but you may be 
wrong; And never take time 
from your labore, To rest either body or mrnd, 
For fe.r you may lose 
a few_dollars, Or fortune 
,nay falter behind. When nnture can hold out uo longer, 
But sinks 'neath her 
pressure of ills, Then add some more 
weight to her burden, 
lly taking a portion of 
pills. If then she 
refuses to labor, . Why, just let a doctor 
prescribe. He'll add to your 
system more poison, 
And charge you o. round sum 
besides. Do 1hia till you have to givo under, And nature 
i, ,vorn to the quick, 
Then at a kind Providence m 
urrnur, And ,~onder why 'tis you are 
sick. Search almunac, pamphlet and paper, Take every quack nostrum you find, 
And thus in the prime of your manhood, 
You' II ruin both body 
and mind. Yonr thoughts will whirl round in confusion, 
Your form with 
disease will be bowed, And thu~ e'er your days are half numbered, 
You'll need both a coffin and 
shroud; Your neighborŁ 
will gather around you, 
And wonder 
why death thus ~hould come, They' II call it 
a sad di.,pensiition, And lay you away in the tomb. Oha.-lot 1,, .Mi.ck. Keep a supply of smiles and kind words for home use .
