WHERE ARE YOU GOING DEAR CHILDREN :ŠAs I was riding on the cars the other day I saw many people traveling, and they were laughing and talking very merrily. Some of them had on gold finger-rings and gold ear-rings, and gold breast-pins, and gold chains about their necks, and a great number of laces and ribbons ; and as I sat and looked at them, I thought, Do they know where they are going? Well, children, there are but two places where they can go at last. These (the wicked) shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. Matt. xxv, 46. ,. So you see, children, that all must go to one of these two places'; and yet a great many people .Ł  act as though they ,thought themselves bound for no place in particular. Now, children, if you should go to Boston har- IMMO 111, _J/Ig .111111111111. 'UMW. PP-1...11111!..Ł 62 YOUTH'S IN that Thou shalt not kill is a part of the law he is talking about. The apostle James says, Who-soever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. James ii, 10, 11. Now James teaches us to keep the whole law, but does not give us the whole law. He gives us, however, two com-mandments of the law of which he speaks. These two are, Donot commit adultery, and, Do not kill. Now if we can find a whole law, and these two precepts are a part of it, we must keep the whole of it, even if we find it in the Old Tes-tament ; for James teaches us that whos'osver does not keep the whole is guilty. QUESTIONS.ŠWhere is the whole law of God not found? How many histories of the life of Christ does the New Testament contain? What are they some-times called? What book conies next? What are the epistles? What is the last book in the Bible called? What things were shown to John in vision? What is there in all the scriptures? WhatŁis often spoken of? What does this show us? What did Christ and the apostles affirm to be binding? When was the law of which Christ spoke in Mntt. v, 18, given? How much of it does he teach us to keep? What is a part of that law? What does the apostle James say? How many commandments of the law does he repeat? What are they? What must we do if we find a whole law of which these two are a part? STRUCTOR. men must have been taught of God what ac-tions were right. And, in fact, we know that they had the law of God, although it is not written in the history of these times, that is, the book of Genesis. For God says, Abraham obey-ed my voice, and kept my charge, my command-ments, my statutes, and my laws. Gen. xxvi, 5. He could not have kept a law before that law was made known to him. So we know that God had a law and righteous men kept it, thought the law itself is not recorded here. OnŁthe other hand, those wicked men who were destroyed by flood and flame, broke the law, and were sinners in the sight of God. And they could not be sinners without a law, for sin is the transgression of the law, [1 John iii, 4,] and where no law is there is no transgres-sion. Rom. iv, 15. Thus we see that the law of God existed dur-ing those early ages, that good men kept it, and bad men broke it; and wherever we can find a whole law which God has given at any time, we may be confident that it is the same law which those righteous men kept ; for he does not change, and his perfect rule of right cannot change. NUMBER Iv. Let us now look for the law of God in that part of the Bible called the Old Testament. The book of Genesis is a brief history of events, beginning with the creation of the world, and extending over a period of more than two thou-sand years. During this time there lived sorn& men who were approved of God, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, and Jacob. These the Lord called righteous mil, *cause they did right. But there were ty wicked men in those times, like Cain who killed his brother, and God sent dreadful judgments upon them for their sins. At cine time he sent a flood of water upon the earth, and destroyed all men living but eight persons; [Gen. vii;] at an-other time he rained fire and brimstone on four cities, and burned them up with all their inhab-itants, with the exception of one man and a part of his family. Gen. xix. But the law of God is not writteu in the book of Genesis. No set of rules are here given for men: to live by. But it is reasonable to suppose that God had then revealed to risen what was right and what was wrong. Those righteous Ł QUESTION8.ŠWhat is the book of Genesis? Begin-ning with what? Over how long a period does it ex-tend? What faithful men lived during this time? What did the Lord call such men? Why? Who else lived in those times? What did God send upon them? What for? How many persons were saved from the flood? Where is the law of God not written? What did God say to Abraham, by which we know that there had been a law given in his time? What were those wicked men who were destroyed? What is sin? What is said in Rom. iv, 15? If we find a whole law somewhere else, in the Bible, of what may we be con-fident?
