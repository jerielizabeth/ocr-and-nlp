THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 5 But is it the prevailing practice of the teachers of the different religious bodies, and of their followers at the present day, to hold up to the world, as the man of their counsel, and the rule of their action, the Word of God, blazing with sacred truth ? Do they consult this blessed word first and last and mainly, and earnestly and prayerfully seek for the saving truths therein contained, as one seeking and searching for hidden treasures ? We think facts in the case, show the reverse to be true respecting many " strange and divers doctrines," promulgated in these days of peril. We would be saved from all hasty and un-charitable conclusions ; but, it is greatly to be feared that catechisms, creeds and the inferences of Doctors of Divinity, are held in such an estimate by many of the professedly pious, that the plain, simple teachings of the sacred scriptures are overlooked, and the com-mandment of God made void through tradition. This most certainly is true in regard to the Sab bath ; in proof of which, we have only to become ac-quainted with the various and conflicting opinions of those who have arrayed themselves against the Sab-bath of the fourth commandment. Nothing can be more clearly expressed than, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God ;" yet how dreadfully this text is mangled and wrested by many to favor the first-day theory. Some months since, a minister was requested by some of his hearers, to preach on the subject of the Sabbath, and present the claims for Sunday-keeping. He re-marked that he had written a sermon with that ob-ject in view, and should deliver it soon. " But," said he, "it is a mixed up mess! There is hardly enough to make a sermon out of it. All you can make of it is one seventh part of time. The question was than asked, Does the fourth commandment of the decalogue teach that one seventh part of time is the Sabbath, without specifying any particular day ? or does it teach that the seventh-day is the Sabbath? In reply he affirmed that it was one seventh part of time without reference to any definite day. Every candid and honest reader must see at once that the above method of interpretation would rob the Word of God of all definiteness, and leave us to the conjecture and speculation of every opposer of the truth. In view of this attempt and indeed every other, to sustain the first-day theory, we ask how much near-er the Bible truth has the Protestant arrived on this point;  lithan the Papist who proves his religious faith by Butler's Catechism ? A. S. HUTCHINS. Buck's Bridge, N. Y. Aug. 1st 1864. Communication From Bro. Seaman, ALmosT thirteen years have elapsed since first attention was arrested in Rochester to the glad news of a soon coming Saviour. And while the mind is exercised in reflection on the past movement of God among his people, many and vivid are the associa-tions that entwine around the memory of those glo-rious scenes. Happy and joyous were the feelings of those who honestly expected the speedy consum-mation of their hope; but disappointment and sad-ness was their cup. In referring briefly to the past, I wish to inquire if anything has failed, and if God has not fulfilled his word. First, the great movement on time, that the Saviour might be expected to return to this earth sometime during the year 1843, was hut the ful-fillment of the symbolic message of Rev. xiv, 6, and the great witness that the end was at hand. Matt. xxiv, 14. That a class of messengers did run through the length and breadth of this land, and also that a message based on time, was heard in every island and kingdom under heaven, is a historical fact hi the past. The signs that God has hung out in the heavens, which no man living has been able to account for on any natural principles, all spoke in trumpet tones, The hour of his judgment is come. But the vision seemed to tarry. The year '43 passed. The eyes of the Advent host that arose and trimmed their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom, were held. They could not perceive all the mind of the Spirit. The parable of the virgins is to be fulfilled in Advent history. Then came the proper application of the prophet Habakkuk: "For the vision is yet "foran appointed time ; but at the end it shall speak and not lie : though it tarry wait  for it ; because it will surely come it will not tarry." A little mistake in the commencement of the 2300 days (or years) showed that they must terminate on the tenth day of the seventh Jewish month, 1844. Then soon was heard as the rushing of a mighty wind, the solemn cry, Behold the Bridegroom com-eth, go ye out to meet him ! Many nominal profess-ors had supposed that by the passing of 1843, Miller-ism, as they chose to call it, was dead ; and they were as much astonished as if they had heard a clap of thunder in a clear sky, so sudden and powerful was the movement from the time when the first notes of the midnight cry were heard, until the memorable tenth of the seventh month was fulfilled in Advent history. Therefore God's word has been fulfilled. The days have ended. The Bridegroom came to the Ancient of days as recorded in Dan. vii, 13. But, says one, he did not come to this earth? Certainly not : the prophecy does not affirm that he would, but that then the Sanctuary should be cleansed. Before Christ comes to the earth, there is the wedding. Says Luke, [xii, 35, 36,E Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return rom the wedding. The first and second angels have flown in close connexion with the midnight cry. The announce-ment has been made, Babylon is fallen, fallen, &c., and that the Spirit of God, moved out a people to perform his will, is as clear as noon-day. If they had not done it in the proper time, the very stones would have cried out; and they were as justifiable in the sight of heaven, as ever the multitude were that shout-ed, Hosanna to the Son of David, when he rode into Jerusalem ; and I would not say but their disappoint-ment was quite as great as ours. Here I might ask before I pass to consider the cause of our disappointment, What gave such power and solemnity to the work just referred to ? What made the churches stand as if the solemnity of eter-nity was resting upon them? What held the wick-ed in check, and caused the stoutest hearts to quake? What whispered in your ear, Dear Reader, when the evidences were presented, It is truth ? I believe it was the Spirit of God; yea, I know it. Bind up the testimony. Many of the Advent lead-ers have tried to tear it in pieces, but it must be bound up, and the law sealed among the disciples, that they may be able to stand in the great battle just before us. I thank God for light on his Word. It is just as true because fulfilled in my day, as if it had been fulfilled in a former period. Lastly, the cause of our disappointment is ex-plained in brief, by our not perceiving what was the Sanctuary to be cleansed≈†the Sanctuary in heaven. Now the solemn time of cleansing, or, in other words, the hour of judgment, is passing before us. The third angel's message is sounding through the land, waxing louder and louder. This is the last echo of warning that this world will ever hear. How sol-emn the thought! How interesting the time to those who desire to hear the approving voice of their soon coming Saviour! Soon the third angel will cease his mission. Then there will be no more mercy for sinners ; but the wine of the wrath of Almighty God without mixture shall be poured upon their defense less heads. Though they flourish as a green bay-tree, it is that they may be destroyed for ever. Let us strive to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. E. R. SEAMAN. Rochester Aug. 1st, 1854. The Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment not Altered but Confirmed by the Atonement. IT has often been said by our brethren and sisters. and is confirmed by the Scriptures, that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment was given in honor of God's resting on the seventh day from the work of creation. Ex. xx, 11, compared with Gen. ii, 2, 3. Brom these, as well as many other passages of Scrip-ture, we find that the Sabbath was given at the time of the finishing of the work of creation, and in hon-or of that work, or of the rest on that day, of God the author of that work. But it is said in the Scrip-tures that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath ; and how was it made for man ? From the scriptures already quoted, we find that it was made while the earth was in purity, and while Adam was the only man on the earth ; and it was made for him, and, through him, for all his posterity. So then we see that it was not made for the children of Israel exclusively, but for all mankind ; and we al-so find that the seventh day is the Sabbath. But it is said at the present time by almost all people, that it was changed at the resurrection of Christ; for he (Christ) finished the atonement on the first day of the week when he arose from the dead. But suppo-sing that this was the case, it would not prove any-thing like the change of the Sabbath; but did he then  finish the atonement? Let the Scriptures speak on this point? I have never heard it stated that it was later in the week when he was crucified, than the sixth day, or Friday at 3 o'clock P. M.; or, Bi-ble reckoning, at the 9th hour, when he died. Com-pare Matt. xxvii, 46-50. with Mark xv, 33-37, and Luke xxii, 44-46; and in John xix, 48, and onward, we find the history as follows : Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the Scriptures might be fulfilled declared himself thirsty ; and they gave him some vinegar ; and in verse 30 he says, It is finished ; and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost, or died : now I. would ask any one to tell me what was finished if the.-atonement was not'? and if the atonement was here finished, it was finished on the sixth day, or Prklay. At the resurrection an angel is commissioned to come down in the presence of the Roman guard, and also of the women who are come to anoint him, and rolls back the sealed stone, and comforts the women and consigns to them a labor to do immediately ; that is, to go and tell his disciples that he has risen. Nei-ther Jesus nor the angel tells them to rest on that day and keep it as a Sabbath ; but we find him and also the disciples in their ordinary business; so that if this was the Christian Sabbath then both Christ and the disciples did break it; and-we find two of the disciples traveling on that day to Emmaus, which was about three-score furlongs from Jerusalem ; which is 7-i- miles; and Jesus himself journeys with them and there makes himself known to them, and they return on the same night to Jerusalem, making ajourney of fifteen miles on the Sabbath if the first day of the week is the Sabbath. Now I ask any one who is contending that the Sabbath was changed from the seventh to the first day of the week to bring so much as one precept, or one example from the Bible; but until this can be done I am obliged to raft on the seventh day and la-bor on the first. May God bless us all, my breth-ren and sisters, and save us from the fables of these last days. I remain your unworthy brother striving to keep the commandments of God, and trust that I have the faith of Jesus. ZEItiNA MARSH. South Hadley, Mass‚Äî July 30th, 1854. GOD. HE is our Father, and we are his children. He watches over us with a tender care ; and, " as a fath-er pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." This tender and indissoluble relation hinds us to him by the strongest ties, and is calcula-ted to excite the most ardent filial affection and grat-itude. He is our Sovereign and Law-giver, and we are his subjects; and all his laws are framed on the principles of eternal and immutable rectitude, and are calculated to promote the harmony and happiness of the whole intelligent creation. He is our Master, and we are his servants; and "his commandments are not grievous." He is our Friend in adversity, our Protector in danger and in distress, our Instruc-tor who has imparted to us knowledge and under-standing, and our Redeemer who " spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all," that we might be rescued from the gulf of depravity and ruin, and exalted to a state of consummate felicity. In fine, he is that being who is the inexhaustible founta in of light of life and of joy, to all things, on who m de-pend all our future prospects in this world, and all the transporting scenes to which we look forward in an interminable state of existence. All these and many other relations,in which we stand to the God of heaven, demonstrate that supreme love to this beneficient Being, is the first and highest du-ty of every rational creature; and they present the most powerful motives to stimulate us to its exor- cise. [Thos. Dick, LL. D. The best Teacher I ever had. HE was never weary. Why, I cannot tell, except that to teach was his constant pleasure. He was never tedious, and this because the themes of his thought came with such endless variety. He was ever cheerful ; no stupidity, nor provoking wayward-ness of the thoughtless, could disturb his steady pur-pose of teaching. His love for his pupils was a most elevated and most elevating affection. His patience was of the most enduring kind. He never administered a fretting rebuke, nor extravagant praise. His look was more effectual than stripes or prizes, and yet his training was admirable. The lessons were short, but strict as the line and plummet. Many a student's tear would start in the severe task ; but the result was happy when the best exertions were put forth. His scholars were strong and sound as steel, well fitted for even the storm and tempest. You need not ask his name. Just hear his voice : "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye. In
