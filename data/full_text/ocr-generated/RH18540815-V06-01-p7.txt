Extracts of Letters. Bao. M. L. Dean writes from Ulysses Pa. Aug. 1st 1854 :Š" The brethren here are all interested in read-ing the paper. The cause is prospering in this region. There seems to be a large field here ready for the har-vest. Bro. Ingraham is doing what he can, but can-not supply the wants of the people." Bro. Luman Carpenter writes from Oswego, Aug. 3d 1854:Š"I feel that the paper is a welcome mes-senger. It is cheering to hear from the brethren and sisters from all parts of the field. May the Lord speed the paper, and the messengers ; for the harvest is fully ripe. I feel that union in the work of the Lord must prevail. Truth is strong and mighty. The Saviour says, Thy word is truth. The com-mandments of God and the faith of Jesus is the word by which God is purifying to himself a peculiar peo-ple. My prayer is, that I may receive benefit from its teachings, that I may be thorougly furnished un-to all good works. I am trying to do my whole du-ty. I want to be ready for the coming of the Lord, and his kingdom. I want a place there. Though I am unworthy and unprofitable, I hope through the merits of the Lamb of God to overcome, and so be forever with the Lord." Bro. Samuel Warner writes from Providence, R.I., Aug. 1st 1854:Š' Blessed be God's holy name for his mercy to me in giving me to see and feel that it is a duty and pleasure to keep his commandments with the faith of Jesus. I do humbly pray for strength to resist all worldly influences, and to over-come all my sinful propensities and be completely reconciled to my God through Jesus Christ my right-eousness, and wait with patience for his coming and kingdom. I tender my love to all brethren and sis-ters, who love the Lord. keep his commandments, and look with a lively faith for his soon coming; and I humbly trust that I may make one of the number who will be saved by grace and faith in his holy teachings." OBITUARY. IN behalf of the deceased I would announce through the Review, the death of our beloved Sister. Char-lotte Caroline Turner, who died of cholera at Mad-ison, Wis., July 25th. The enemy overtook her when separated from her husband and home, and she fell beneath his fatal blow. In 1842, sister T. united with the the Baptist Church, and the following Spring she heard the proc-lamation of the first angel, which she gladly received, and was a firm believer in the second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, until the Spring of 1851, when she saw that she was a transgressor of the fourth commandment. She was awakened to the danger of her situation by the voice of the third an-gel. Rev. xiv, 9-13. She received the message and embraced the present truth, and has since been striv-ing to keep all the commandments, that she might have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city." She left an afflicted husband and son, and a large circle of relatives and friends, who deeply fed their loss. But we trust they mourn not as those without hope. We would offer for their consolation the words of Paul, 1 Thess. iv, 13-18. How sweet the thought that our friends are asleep in Jesus, and THE REVIEW AND HERALD. 7 abolished at the crucifixion; that the commandments could not he kept as God gave them, therefore Christ nailed them to his cross, and therefore Christ says, A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another. This course they have to pursue in or-der to get rid of the third angel's message. The angel said to John, If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city. Rev. xxii, 19. Now men have the power to resist the truth; but like Jannes and Jambres their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. We hope the truth will shortly begin to take effect here. We have done what we could in our unworthy way. There has been no meeting here since last October. We have been almost discouraged, but we have continued to cry to God for help. He is our only help: thanks be to his ever blessed name. Bro. Holt called upon us on his way east. We were very glad to see him. We expect him to, labor among us awhile, on his return from Vermont. 0 brethren pray for us here. We are glad to hear of the spread of the truth and its good effects in tlfe West. I. D.

But though darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the geople, yet we are not in darkness that that that day should overtake us as a thief; therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober. let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. I am glad there have been such arrangements made about the paper. Let us all do our part toward sustaining it, that our faith may he manifested by our works ; for faith without works is dead, being alone. Yours striving to overcome. EMILY DAY. Milan, 0., July 28th, 1854. From Bro. Daniels. DEAR BRO. Witrrc :ŠHo w plain it is to every discerning mind that the holy law of God is the seal of the living God, mentioned in Rev. vii, 2. Before the first-born in Egypt were slain, God's children had a mark upon their door-posts for a sign that the destroying angel might not come into their houses to destroy them. The blood was sprinkled upon their door-posts. The destroyer did not come to that house, but passed by it, This was their mark or sign. Those that had the mark were safe. Is not God's holy law the same to us as the passover was to them? I think it is. God is about to smite the land of Egypt with the seven last plagues; and before the four angels cease their holding, God's children must have a mark upon their door-posts, that no plague come nigh their dwelling ; for God says a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling ; [Ps. xci, 7-10 ; J for his truth shall he thy shield and buckler; [verse 4;J and God's law is truth. Ps. cxix, 142. The angels are to hold the four winds until God's children are sealed with the seal of the living God in their foreheads. God's ho-ly law is this seal. fn. viii, 16, says, Bind up the testimony, seal theklaw among my disciples. Then we find in Deut. v and vi, that Moses, in giving his charge unto Israel before he died, puts them in mind 'of the ten commandments which God gave to them in Horeb, and he commands them to observe to do them, and not to turn to the right or to the left. Chap. vi. Now these are the commandments and statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded, to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it. That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God to keep all his stat-utes and his commandments which I commanded thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life. and that thy days may be prolong-ed. Verse 4. Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. Verse 5. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. Verse 6-9. And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes; (then it must be in their foreheads; so we see that the ten commandments are a sign in the forehead and in the handŠmark in the forehead or in the handŠthird angel's message. Rev. xiv, 9 LI and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and upon thy gates. The day of slaughter is- at hand, when old and young are to be slain; [Eze. ix ; J and the law of ten commandments is to be our shield and buckler, and frontlets between our eyes, that the slaughtering men may pass over us. 0 I do rejoice in the holy law of God: it has done a great work for me. Dear brethren and sisters, let nothing move you from the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus. DEXTER DANIELS. Sandisfielet, Mass., Aug. 5th, 1854. From Bro. Cramer. DEAR BRO. WHITE :ŠWe are still among the ac-countable beings of the world. Shut in as we are, we are trying to live out the truth of the third an-gel's message. There are truly many trials connec-ted with our daily endeavors to do good to those around us, in presenting the truth to those we hope to benefit. The Timeists are how coming along with additional folly to their theory. They are pre-senting to the public that the 1335 days end the 19th of next May, and that "Blessed are they that wait and come to that time; for Daniel is to stand in his lot at that time. They contend that the law was  that their sleep is blessed, verily. It seems they are taken from the evil to come. Blessed are the dead which die fn the Lord from henceforth ; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them." How blest the state of all the righteous dead, Who holy lives of purity have led: From henceforth, saith the Spirit, yea, they rest From all their works, and are divinely blest. No more the Tempter's wiles, their feet shall snare; But sweetly sleeping, rest from all their care ; Calmly they wait the trumpet's solemn sound, Which wakes the sleeping saints, beneath the ground. Now bursts the fetters of the cheerless tomb, Awake to bright, to full, immortal bloom. Oh cruel grave ! thy boasted victory bring, And thou, 0, tyrant death, where is thy sting! L. M. STEPHENSON. SPIRITUALISM. " But there were false prophets also amongthe people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily [Pri-vate Circles,] shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction." 2 Pet. ii, 1. " When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden de-struction cometh upon them." 1 Thess. v, 3. "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit," Ize. Chap. xviii, 2. "Whose [Christ's] coming is after [immediately following] the working of satan with all power, and signs and lying won-ders." 2 Thess. ii, 9. "And shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very sleet." Matt. axiv, 24. Facts for Dr. Dods and Professor Faraday. The Society for the diffusion of Spiritual Knowledge are issuing a weekly in pursuance of their object, called the Chris-tian Spiritualist. From it we take the following:Š . " Again, we have had rapped out : 'lay fifty pieces of paper in a locked cupboard, and we will write upon them.' In less than half an hour there was a communication of at least ten lines on each piece, and each commuication perfect-ly characteristic of the individual professing to communicate. We have the remains of a table which was broken all to pieces by a. Spirit professing to be Samson of oldŠbroken all in small pieces and not one person was near it. The table being near the wall, commenced moving as we came into the room to form a circle, and moved until I came to about the Middle, when the Spirit commenced breaking it, and the floor when he got through, was a perfect sight to behold, all cov-ered with splinters. The whole company, (sane ten or fifteen, all sceptics except myself,) were perfectly convinced." Were these men all "psycologized," Doctor'? Are the splinters, still kept, permanent phantoms engendered in the " back brain '1" Whoever this Spirit is that as.mmes so strong a name, his deeds, we hope will testify that he has some right to it, either natural or acquired; and that he will keep on until he car-ries away the " brazen gates" of the Gaza, in which materi-alistic superstition has entrenched itself. A correspondent of the Christian Spiritualist writing from Washington, D. C., says It is gratifying to witness the steady and onward course of Spiritualism, and the intense anxiety of many persons to become acquainted with facts and witness the phenomena. In our city we have much greater interest awakened, than is generally known; many persons in high places are very much interested in the subject, but are afraid to have it understood that they should be guilty of such an enormity, which might be productive of a decree to hurry them to the Insane Asylum. After a while these fooleries will give way to the force of truth, and will be auxiliaries to the cause, which, at present, are like the viscus on the body politic. We thank God that the promise is even as it is. When we look back through the sins of years, since the in-troduction of this subject by Baron Swedenborg, and see its slow progress, we can hardly look without astonishment on the rapid and unprecedented advancement it has made in a short eve years. Increasing in the same ratio, what may we expect in the neat ten? CARRIED BY AN INVISIBLE POWER ŠP. B. Randolph sta-ted, at the Conference of July 25th, that a gentleman of his acquaintance recently went into his parlor with a candle in his hand, intending to get for it a candlestick that was upon the parlor mantle-shelf He distinctly saw the candlestick upon the shelf as he went toward it, but before he got to it some one in the other room spoke to him, and he went back to answer the person who had spoken. As here-entered the par-lor the candlestick which he had before distinctly seen was gone, and at that instant he heard it fall upon a trunk about thirty feet distant from the mentleplece where it bad before stood. There was no visible person any where near who could have moved it, and the only conclusion that seemed admissible was that it must have been moved by Spirit-agen-cy. A writer to the Telegraph, says :ŠDuring a recent sitting at a private circle in your city, consisting of four persons be-sides myself, the following demonstrations occurred. In about five minutes after the circle was formed, I began tofeel distinct touches from some object resembling a human hand ; these touches were first felt on the knee, then on the arm, and at last on the forehead. It was sufficiently light in the room to enable me to discern the movements of those who com-posed the circle, and I know as positively as I know that I am penning you this article, that I was touched by no mor-tal hand in the room.
