YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR. 59 --- nected with the life of the Christian are In by various parables and figures n the Bible. Sometimes they are represented by one running a race, and again by one engaged in warfare, &e. "So run that ye -may obtain." "Lee us run with patience the race that is- set before us." " I have fought a good fight." "Pot the weapons of our warfare are not car-nal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds." .Froin the figures here used it is evident that all hope of successful victory, by those thus en-gaged, depends upon perseverance. The same is true of the Christian. His life is across bear-ing, self-denying life, and perseverance in the discharge of every duty3  must characterize him, if he would win the prize and wear the crown. "Then On let us press; for Jesus is near, And strengthen each otter With words of good cheer; With zeal ever buoyant and courage ne'er slack, Let's be true to our King and never draw back." The blessed promise "and as thy days, so shall thy strength be," should encourage us to great diligence, and to he not weary in well-doinn. "Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to .stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with trUth—and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your 'feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ; * * Pray-ing always with all prayer and supplication in the'Spirit, and watching thereunto with all per-severance and supplication for all saints." Again, in consideration-of the reward which awaits all who endure in the ehriStian warfare unto the end, we urge the importance of perse-verance. "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovaltle, always abounding in the work of the Lord, fora.stnuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the fiord." 1 Cor. xv, 58. " Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall re-ceive his own reward according to his own , la-bor." The reflection that one may secure a home in the mansions of glory, mid tor ever enjoy the society of the blood-washed throng, and feign with Christ in his soon comingkingdoni, encoura-ges me to press- on and cheerfully bear all the allotments of a kind and gracious Providence, till I reach my happy home in glory. 4 Dear reader, I deeply feel for your salvation, and do most earnestly pray' that you may avail yourself of the means in mercy granted by the great Giver of every good and perfect gift, for a home in the kingdom of heaven. To those who have not yet made their peace with God, allow me to say, that the Spirit of God has undoubtedly often impressed you with the importance of making an immediate prepa-ration for the solemn events of the future, and  you have doubtless resolved frequently to obey its teachings : if so, reduce these promises and resolutions to practice without delay, and faith-fully persevere until you hear the welcome plaud-it, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."  ALFRED S. HUTCHINS. Bangor, July 1854. RING UZZIAH. DEaa CHILDREN :ŠDo you realize what a privilege it is, to have kind friends, who take such an interest in your welfare and future.sab. vation, as to send you such an interesting pa-per, filled with words of kindness and instruc-tion. Do you'read them carefully, and ponder upon them ? How much pains is taken, to make the communications simple, so that you can understand them. How many kind and af-fectionate letters are written, to encourage and assist you. I trust you are thankful for them, and try to profit by them. Most Children love stories. There are a great many good,stories in the Bible, which are very instructive. I will relate one to you which will teach you a moral. It is the history of king Uzziali, who lived in the days of Zechari- ah. You will find the history in 2 Citron. xxvi. Uzziah was the son of Amaziah, who was slain for his wickedness. Uzziah was only sixteen years old when he began to reign in his fath-er's place. Now Uzziah acted very wisely, for he hearkned to Zechariah who was a prophet of the Lord, and the Lord instructed him through visions which he gave to Zechariah. Uzziah prospered, and became very rich. God helped hiin in all his undertakings, and gave him vic-tory over his enemies, as long as he called on the name of the Lord. But Uzziah became proud, and his heart was lifted up and he acted very wickedly. 'But God punished him for his sin, You have read the lessons on the Sanctuary, and I suppose you k. .ffice of the Priest is to minister in th. :A.. Now Uzziah was so proud that he tho e could take the place of the Priest, and burn i i cense, and it would be acceptable to God. But God cannot look won sin with the least degrse sof allowance." He saw him, ai*l while the censer was in his hind, God smote him with leprosy ; and Uzziah was driven out from among the people of God, and was de-spised and rejected of them. He lived solitary and forsaken, and died a leper. Now Uzziah knew better than to enter the temple of the Lord ; for the Priest alone had a right to enter there. The Lord dealt very justly with Uzziah. Here is a lesson to the proud and exalted. Do you not see how foolish and wicked it is to be-come exalt&l. If men only considered, how frail and weak is poor mortal man, and how li-able he is to err, they would not exalt them-selves above their fellow creatures. What-  a
