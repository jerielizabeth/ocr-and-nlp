NUMBER III. The law of God, as a whole, is not found in the New Testament. This part of the Bible con-tains four histories of the life of Christ from hie biith to his burial and resurrection, sometimes called the four gospels. Then an account of the doings of the apostles, how they preached the gospel, traveling from place to place. This is cal-led the Acts of the Apostles. Then we have the epistles, which are letters written by the apostles to various. churches and individuals. And last of all is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, given in , vision to John, on the isle of Patmos, showing the things which were to take place afterwards, from that time to the end of the world, and the mak-ing of a new heavens and earth, in which the saints will live forever. In all these writings, or scriptures, there is no whole code, or body of laws; no part of them is call d the law of God. But the law, and the comfrequent' me of them are repeated. This *ts of God are often spoken of, and comm  ad  shows us that there had been a law given, which Christ and his apostles did not think it necessa-ry to give again. But they affirmed the whole law to be binding. Our Saviour had given no body of laws to his disciples when he said, One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law. Matt. v, 18. Then he spoke of a law which had been given before the first book of the New Testament was written ; and he teach-es us to keep the whole of it. He says, Whoso-ever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Verse 19. We see by reading a little fui tiler; YOUTH'S IN NUMBER II. In our last lesson we mentioned two kinds of law. The first is the rule of duty towards God and each other. It is a rule by which we can tell what actions are right and what are wrong. For this reason we call it the moral law. By this law we learn what actions are sinful; for an Apostle says, sin is the transgression of the law. 1 John iii, 4. All of us can see, then, that if man had not sinned, he would have kept this law. But the other kind of laws was given to man because lie was a sinner, that is, because he had transgressed the first law, or the law of right and wrong. This second law we call the ritual, or ceremonial law, because it consisted of rites, or ceremonies by which the believing, penitent sin-ner might obtain forgiveness of sins. If men had not broken the moral law of God, they never would have been obliged to perform rites for re--mission of sins. They never would have been commanded to take an innocent animal from the flock, and offer him, a sacrifice for sin, by shed-ding his guiltless blood. Those offerings were typical of Christ. The person offering them vir-tually acknowledged himself worthy of death for his sins, and expressed his faith in Christ, the Lamb of God, who was to come and die for the sins of the world. Now when we read of Christ's blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross, we know that the law that required those sacrifices for sin, is meant. God never gave man anything that was contrary to him, till he had done contra-ry to the moral law of God. The word, law, in the New Testament means, sometimes the first and sometimes the second law. We can always tell which is meant by what is said of it. When Jesus says, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, [Matt. v, 18,] we know that he means the first, or moral law. But when Paul speaks of a law having a shadow of good things to comeŠwhich stood only in meats and drinks, (offerings,) and carnal ordinances, (rites and cere-monies,) imposed on them until the time of refer-oration, (till Christ the better sacrifice was offered,) [Heb. x, 1; ix, 10,] we know that he means the second, or ceremonial law. When James pro-nounces every person guilty who does not keep the whole law, [chap. ii, 10,] he speaks of the moral rule of God's government, which Jesus STRUCTOR. 61 came not to destroy. Matt. v, 17. But when we read of the law of commandments contained in ordinances, those ceremonies are referred to, which Jesus came to abolish. Eph. ii, 15. QuEsnoxs.ŠWhat were mentioned in our last les-son? What is the first? What do we call it? What do ;We learn by this law? What does an Apostle say? Why was the other kind of laws given to man? What do we call this second lavO Had men kept the moral law, what would they never have been obliged to per-form? Of, whom were offerings typical? Of what did the person offering them acknowledge himself worthy? In whom did he express his faith? What law did Christ nail to his cross? In the New Testa-ment, what does the Word law mean? By what can we tell which is meant? Wbat did Jesus say in Matt. v, 18? What law did he mean? What is referred to in lieb. ix, 10?
