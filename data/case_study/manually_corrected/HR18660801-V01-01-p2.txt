# 2 THE HEALTH REFORMER. 

at work upon the morsel of food, the 
mucous membrane begins to secrete moisture, 
the salivary glands by the irritating 
process of chewing, throw ont a large 
quantity of fluid, which, mixing with the 
food, serves the double purpose of disolving and moistening the food, also
giving it a slimy consistency in order that it may be detruded into the stomach, 
which is accomplished by the bolus being
protruded hnckward by the tongue to 
the top of the gullet, thence acted upon 
by the contraction of 
muscular rings above the food, forcing it through
the Å“sophageal opcniug and the cardiac valve into the stomach, where it 
goes a change both in action and chemical
composition. The stomach is disturbed 
by the introduction of food, which 
drives, in a measure, the blood to the 
head, causing a chilly sensation sometimes 
over the body, but stimulating the brain. 

In about four or five minutes after the 
arrival of food in teh stomach, the gastric
juice begins to flow, which changes the 
checmical action of the food. The blood
returning from the head, serves to contract 
the stomach by the disttention of its 
blood vessels, and serves the purpose of 
assisting in digestion by causing that organ
to contract upon th efood, which undergoes
a churning process over a vast
number of small projections, the gastric
juice bringing the food into a semi-fluid 
state. This gastric juice continues 
to flow from seven to nine hours, then
ceases until food is again instroduced,
hence the necessity of giving this organ
sufficient time to rest after each meal, in
order to avoid that much-dreaded disease,
Dyspepsia. The gastric juice is
said to be absorbed as fast as digestion 
goes on; the quantity required to digest 
a pound of meat in the stomach of a dog,
is about thirteen pints, and with all this,
the meat first putrefies, giving rise to
putrid odor of breath, both in man and
beast.

As each lot of gastric juice performs
its office, it is re-absorbed, so that secretion
and absorption are going on at the 
same time, and thus the fluid lost to the
blood by one process, is replaced by the 
other. There is a separation of the food
near the pyloric extremity of the stomach,
by its vermicular action. The digested 
food is forced through the pyloric 
valve into the duodenum, where it is first
acted upon by the bile, and next by the 
pancreatic juice, which serves to still further 
digest the food; and during digestion,
there is a constant circulation of 
fluids, from the alimentary canal to the 
blood, and from the blood to the digestive 
canal, &c. The quantity of gastric
juice thus excreted and secreted, by a 
healthy man daily, will be about fourteen
pounds avoirdupois.

The food having now arrived at the 
duodenal portion of the digestive tract,
it there undergoes a very interesting and
wonderful change. The bile here takes
the food and still further assimilates it to 
the wants of the body. Here the bile
still further digests the food, giving it a 
yellow tinge, and unites with the pancreatic 
juice and other intestinal juices or
fluids, to transform the starchy food into
sugar. In this process the bile performs
a small part, but the pancreatic juice a 
large share. The bile also acts upon the 
fat, upon which the stomach has but little
effect, but which is now converted into a 
white opaque substance call chyle, and
is always found in the small intestines.

The digestion of fat does not take place
all at once, but only after it has passed
the biliary and pancreatic ducts.

More hereafter.

## Duty to Know Ourselves
## BY E. G. white

Many have inquired of me, "What
course shall I take to best preserve my 
health?" My answer is, Cease to transgress
the laws of your being; cease to 
gratify a depraved appetite; eat simple
food; dress healthfully, which will require
modest simplicity; work healthfully;
and you will not be sick.

It is a sin to be sick; for all sickness is the 
result of transgression. Many are 
suffering in consequence of the transgression
of their parents. They cannot
be censured for tehir parents' sin; but it
is nevertheless their duty to ascertain
wherein their parents violated the laws of
their being, which has entailed upon their
offspring so miserable an inheritance;
and wherein their parents' habits were 
wrong, they should change their course,
and place themselves by correct habits in 
a better relation to health.

Men and women should inform themselves
in regard to the philosophy of
health. The minds of rational beings
seem shrouded in darkness in regard to 
their own physical structure, and how to
