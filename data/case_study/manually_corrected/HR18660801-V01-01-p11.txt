# WAY TO BE SICK.   11

than the owners proceed to fatten and kill 
them for the market. Particularly is this 
the case in all swellings, sores, and other 
marks of scrofula in these creatures. 

7. Animals not originally diseased are 
necessarily made such by the fattening 
process. Deprived of exercise, and tempted
to eat far beyond the wants of nature, 
they become in due time a mass of diseased 
fat, and then they are just fit to be 
slaughtered for the food of man. 

8. Could we suppose them to escape 
disease in the fattening process, (which 
few if any do), the most of the beef in the 
market is the flesh of animals transported 
hundreds of miles on the cars, and allowed
to suffer from excessive thirst and from 
the painful situation in which they are 
compelled to ride on the cars, and from 
want of air till they are brought into a 
state of high fever, and then in the very 
act of being slaughtered are maddened 
and infuriated by the treatment they receive, 
and by what thoy see. Does not 
reason teach that it would be "expedient" 
to let such kinds of food be eaten by those 
who will have it? 

9. We live in a time when new and unheard-of
diseases are spreading among the 
domestic animals of every kind. Is it not 
safest to let their flesh cease to be a part 
of our food? 

10. These creatures obtain their flesh 
to a great extent from the fruits and 
grains. Would it not be as well for us 
to eat these before these creatures do it, 
as afterward?

## IS ANIMAL FOOD NECESSARY? 

Mr. Curling, seventeen years an agent on the 
Devon estate in Ireland, says: 

"There are 6,680 persons on the estate. 
They are energetic, moral, and well-behaved. 
I do not remember a crime in 
seventeen years, not even so much as 
stealing a chicken. They are a contented, 
grateful people-grateful even for fair 
play. Out of six hundred farmers, deduct 
fifty, and the rest do not see a wheaten 
loaf, or smell meat, except at Christmas 
and Easter. They have been brought up 
to this custom. One tenant on the Devon 
estate I have seen sit down to potatoes, 
buttermilk and Indian meal, who purchased
at a recent sale Â£10,000 worth of 
property, and did not have to borrow a 
shilling to pay for it. I believe this to be 
the usual mode of living in Limerick." 

## How to Be Sick, 

## BY C. M. WILLIS. 

We've read how we ought to keep healthy, 
Enough a large volume to fill; 
I now will present a new subject, 
By telling you how to be ill. 
Never bathe in a drop of cold water, 
For fear it may make you take cold, 
By loosening the shell wbich encrusts you, 
And mnke you feel stiffened and old. 

Eat plenty of pork in hot weather, 
And vegetables swimming in grease; 
Of soda, and biscuit, and pastry, 
Eat freely, as much as you please. 
If one should suggest that 'tis hurtful, 
Treat all such advice with a sneer, 
Just tell them you work for a living, 
You'll have it too, while you stay here. 

If it brings on a pain in your stomach, 
Procure some fine-cut and a pipe, 
Tobacco is good for dyspepsia, 
Tnen use it from morning till night. 
And now and then drink some drugged liquor, 
Nor mind if teetotalers scold, 
'Twill drive out the heat in the summer,
In winter 'twill keep out the cold. 

And when you retire, close the windows, 
Exclude all the evening air quite, 
Draw closely the curtains around you, 
And thus pass the hours of tbe night; 
Then stupid and dull in the morning, 
Crawl languidly out of your bed, 
Drink a cup of strong tea or of coffee, 
To ease the sharp pain in your head.

Keep storming and scolding at trifles, 
No matter where blame may belong, 
All accidents lay on to some one, 
Though no one but you may be wrong; 
And never take time from your labors, 
To rest either body or mind, 
For fear you may lose a few dollars, 
Or fortune may falter behind. 

When nature can hold out no longer, 
But sinks 'neath her pressure of ills, 
Then add some more weight to her burden, 
By taking a portion of pills. 
If then she refuses to labor, 
Why, just let a doctor prescribe. 
He'll add to your system more poison, 
And charge you a round sum besides. 

Do this till you have to give under, 
And nature is worn to the quick, 
Then at a kind Providence mmurmur,
And wonder why 'tis you are sick. 
Search almanac, pamphlet and paper, 
Take every quack nostrum you find, 
And thus in the prime of your manhood, 
You'll ruin both body and mind. 

Your thoughts will whirl round in confusion, 
Your form with disease will be bowed, 
And thus e'er your days are half numbered, 
You'll need both a coffin and shroud; 
Your neighbors will gather around you, 
And wonder why death thus should come, 
They'll call it a sad dispensation, 
And lay you away in the tomb. 

Charlotte, Mich. 

Keep a supply of smiles and kind words 
for home use.
