# 8     THE HEALTH REFORMER

## Editorial.

## To the Reader.
## BY H. S. LAY, M.D.

In coming for the first time before the 
public as an editor of a Health-Reform 
Journal, it may be expected that we say 
a word to our readers in reference to what 
we intend to do, and what we design shall 
be the style and character of the periodical
of which we have been placed in charge.

Knowing something of the great responsibilities
that will be thrown upon us by 
this new position, it would be with some 
misgivings that we engage in this enterprise,
were it not for our ardent desire to 
do all that lies in our power to instruct
and benefit the people in relation to the 
right method of living; and if we do not 
also expect the hearty co-operation of 
those who have the health and well-being
of the people at heart. 

It shall be our great object to lay before 
our readers the facts of vital importance in relation 
to the health reform, and aim to instruct 
the people how to avoid sickness,
or if sick, how to regain their health, and 
that without poisons. It shall be our constant
aim to make the HEALTH REFORMER 
worthy the patronage of an intelligent and 
candid public. Its contributors will be 
persons of experience, and of high mental 
and moral attainments. Its selections will 
be of the choicest kind. 

We also design to devote a limited space 
in each number to the answering of questions 
proposed by our readers relative to 
home treatment, &c., which will be worth 
more than the price of the Journal.

Not only will the reading matter be of 
a high order, but the paper and type will 
be of the nicest quality. In a word, we 
intend to make it a first-class Health Journal,
one that will commend itself to the 
good judgement of an intelligent public.

And now what we ask of all who receive 
this number is, that they will do all they 
can to obtain subscriptions for this Journal, 
and to increase its circulation.

Sickness has come to be the ruling condition 
of mankind, and health the exception;
and a better state of things cannot 
be expected until the laws of life and 
health are better understood and obeyed.
These laws we shall endeavor faithfully to 
explain; and shall inculcate a strict and 
intelligent obedience thereto. 

The subject of Health is not a denominational 
subject. All classes and all parties 
are equally interested in it. While, 
therefore, we shall advocate the proper 
care of our bodies, or the preservation of 
health, from a religious standpoint, that 
is, as a moral duty, it will not be from a 
denominational one; but what we may 
have to say will be adapted to the cases 
and 'necessities of all classes. To all,
therefore, to whom these introductory remarks
may come, we extend the friendly 
hand, and say, Give us your patronage,
and we will endeavor to impart to you 
some principles of the science of healthful 
living, and value of which is not to be estimated
in dollars and cents.

## "No Change of Diet Required."
## BY ELD. R. F. COTTRELL.

There is the highest commendation of 
medicines to the people of the present
age. Hence it is an inducement to quacks
to recommend their nostrums in this way. 
If the people can hope to be cured of 
their maladies by swallowing a drug, and, 
at the same time, continue to violate the 
laws of their being, by swallowing all the 
varieties of unwholesome and deleterious
articles of diet that have brought their 
sickness upon them, it is accounted a 
fine thing. Gluttons are the last sort of 
people who want to starve to death.
They wish to make no change from their 
self-destructive way of living. They will 
have their baneful luxuries, live or die; 
hence they patronize the medicine labeled, 
No Change of Diet Required. The poet 
Pope was right in his description of the 
rulling passion of the glutton. I give his 
description, changed a little to suit our 
own times, and to make it intelligible to 
the reader:

"A feast of swine's flesh, glutton was thy fate, 
The doctor calls, declares all help too late. 
'Mercy!' cries glutton, 'mercy on my soul!
Is there no hope? Alas! The bring the jole!"
