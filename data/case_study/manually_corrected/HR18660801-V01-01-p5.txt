# HEALTH. 5 

and we may labor actively till 
eleven or twelve o'clock. If I ate three 
meals a day, I shonld retire to bed and 
rest from eleven till twelve. As I eat 
but two meals, I rest from twelve till one, 
or half past one o'clock. After slowly 
partaking of dinner, and taking an hour's
rest, I again resume active labor till six 
or even seven o'clock. But a person in 
feeble health, I find must perform his 
greatest amount of physical exercise in 
the fore part of the day. 

Persons in health may say, We have 
not time to rest as you here set forth. 
Well, this you can do : You can retire 
early, eat slowly, and regularly, and 
labor at least moderately for an hour after 
your meal. Even this will tend greatly 
to benefit your health. While if out of 
health, these rules must be imperatively 
followed if we would regain it. Let all 
try, in managing their bodies, to rightly 
apply the principles of labor and rest; 
and especially to guard against the tendency 
of the age, which is to over-labor. 

## Health. No. 1. 
## BY ELD. D. T. BOURDEAU. 

"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest
prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
3 John 2. 

From this text and from other scriptures 
of similar import, it is apparent that 
health is a blessing of sufficient importance
and magnitude to be especially noticed
by inspiration, and to be designed for 
man's enjoyment. It is evident that God's 
original design was that man should enjoy
this rich blessing. Yet it is a lamentable
fact, too plain to be denied, that it 
is possessed but by a few, and only to a
limited extent; that disease and suffering 
are seen and felt everywhere, bringing 
misery and death to the human family. 
And how have these evils been brought 
about? Can they be mitigated? Can 
we enjoy the rich blessing of health? and 
if so, how?

In reply to these questions we would 
say, 1. These evils do not spring from the 
dust, or without cause ; but sickness and 
death come by sin. But, 2. We believe 
that disease can, as a general thing, be 
mitigated, and often healed; though it 
cannot be expected that it will be eradicated
from the earth until the curse is 
wiped away. 3. We also believe that we 
can have health, if disease has not taken 

too strong hold on our systems. The sick, 
as a general thing, can improve their 
health and add to their life; and those 
who are well can also have better health, 
and can, hy pursuing a certain course, 
avoid many diseases that they would otherwise
be subject to, and lengthen their 
days. 4. As to how we can have health, 
we would say, Certainly not by continuing 
in sin. For if we were to get health 
by pursuing the course by which disease 
comes, then would God be represented as 
a changeable being, sin would be justifiable, 
and Satan would rule in spite of the 
Almighty. 

Disease comes by sin, which is the 
transgression of the law of God; therefore
if we would avoid disease we must 
avoid transgressing God's law. But 
in avoiding disease we pursue a course to 
promote health, and to avoid transgression
we must keep the law of God; consequently
in keeping the law of God we 
will enjoy health. With this view of the 
subject, we can understand how the Lord 
could promise health to his ancient people 
for keeping his holy law; and that 
disease would follow their violation of 
this law. Of course, God could add his 
special blessing and his dreadful curse to 
his people according as they obeyed or 
disobeyed his law. 

The law of God makes it obligatory 
upon us to care for our lives and healtlh.
This law may be called the law of life, 
not merely from the consideration that 
life is bestowed for keeping it, but also 
because it is so adapted to the wants of 
our natures, that by keeping it we will, as a 
natural consequence, live longer than we 
would by breaking it. Let the reader 
read each of the ten commandments with 
reference to this point, and see if our assertion 
is not correct. But the sixth commandment, 
in particular, regulates our 
course with regard to preserving life 
and health. It is one of the negative precepts, 
and not only prohibits the sin of destroying 
our lives and the lives of others, but 
it includes the injunction of the contrary 
duty, viz., to make use of all proper and 
available means to ameliorate and preserve 
health, and prolong our existence 
and the existence of others. 

Health is the result of obedience to the 
laws of our being, which grow out of the
law of God, and disease is the result of 
the violation of the same laws. God has 
clothed these laws with ten-fold authority; 
first the health and happiness consequent
