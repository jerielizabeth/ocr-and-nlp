## DIGESTION.
## BY J. H. GINLEY, M.D.

Digestion is that process by which
food is reduced to a form in which it can
be absorbed and taken up into the blood.
This is the way that food builds up the 
waste constantly going on in the body. 
This process is accomplished, 1st. By the 
teeth. 2nd. By the saliva. 3d. By the 
mucous membrane. 4th. By the gastric  
juice. 5th. By the bile; and 6th. By 
the pancreatic juice. 

As the food consists of a mixture of
various kinds, having different physical 
and chemical properties, so also these 
peculiar fluids differ in kind, quality, and
chemical action, from each other. 

As the food passes through the intestines 
from above downward, those parts 
of it which become reduced to a liquid 
state, are successively removed by absorption, 
and taken up into the blood
while the remaining portion, which is in-digestible, 
together with the intestinal 
secretions, acquires a firmer consistency 
owing to the absorption of the fluids, and 
is finally discharged as detrite material, 
by the vermicular action of the intestines. 

In the lower order of animals, the digestive
apparatus is more complex than
in man. The fowl has three stomachs, 
while some of the higher order have four;
while man, the head of the animal creation, 
has but two. There is, however, a great
similarity between the animal digestive
system and that of man. In the human
species, although the digestive apparatus
is simpler than in animals, still it is quite
complicated. The alimentary canal is
divided into different cavities which communicate
with each other by narrow openings.

At its commencement, we find the cavity
of the mouth guarded at its posterior
extremity, by a muscular valve of the 
isthmus of the fauces. Through the Å“sophagus
it communicates iwth the stomach,
which is guarded at either extremity
by circular folds of muscular fibres, called
respectively, the cardiac and pyloric orifices;
then come the small intestines under
different forms and names, owing to their
respective structures. Thus we have the
duodenum, jejunum and ileum.

In the duodenum, we have the biliary 
and pancreatic ducts, and lastly the small
intestines together with the larger ones,
separated from the smaller by the ileocoecal
valve, which is liable to become
closed up by indigestible substances lodging
in it, causing death. Next are the
larger intestines, which are named respectively
the ascending transverse, and
descending colon, at the latter end of
which is a strong muscular band called
the sphincter, and which becomes diseased
to an intense degree in piles (hemorrhoids).

Having thus given a brief description
of the digestive organs, in order to better
understand their uses, let us glance at the 
very interesting process of digestion.
When food is introduced into the mouth,
there is a process of secretion going on 
which continues more or less through the
entire digestive tube. The teeth are set
