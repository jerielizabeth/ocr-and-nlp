Moderation in Diet. DR. LAY: The following, which 
I have taken from an 
ol<l newspaper, may be of 
interest to 
the readers of the 
HEALTH R.1c-FORMEn. A. C. 
BounDEAU. "Health anu longevity are not the only results of moderation in ,Het. Its ence is far from being limited to the 
bo<ly; its cffocts on the mind are still more in1-
portant. .Julius Cesar, constitutionally 
addicted to excess, when resolved on 
sorne great exploit was accustomed to diminish 
his diet to 
an extent truly marvelous, 
and to this 
diminution he asuribed the 
ness and energy of 
mind wl1ich guished him in the hour of battle. 
""\Yhen extraordinary mental vigor 
was desired by the fir~t Napoleon, he used 
the same means to 
attain it. To bis rarelyŁ eqttaled moderation in diet, 
Dr. Franklin ascribed his 'clearness of 
ideas,' and ' quickness of perception,' 
and ed his progress in 
study proportionate to 
the degree of temperance which he 
ticeu. \Vhile Sir lsaac Newton was posing his 'TreatiRe on Optics,' he 
fined himself 
to bread and a 
little sack and water. Scarcely less rigid was the 
abstinence of Leibnit1,, when preparing 
some parts of his 'Universal Language.' D' Aubigne relates of Luther on the 
thoritv of Melancthon, tl1at 'a little bread and a.· single hcrri11g wero often his only 
food for 
a day.-Indeed, he wa~ tionally abstemious, and e\·en after he 
had found out that 
Heaven was not to be 
chased by abstinence, he often contented 
himself with the poorest food, 
and would continue for 
a consider·able time without 
eating or d ri11king.' Dr. Cheyne, a brated physicia11, 
rerluced himself from 
the enormous weight of 448 pounds to 
140 pounds, 
by confining himself to 
a ited quantity of 
veg<'tables, milk and ter, as his only food 
and drink. The 
sult was 
a restoration of health 
anrl tnl vigor-and, amid 
professional and 
erar.y labors, uninterrupted health, 
and protracted life. 
An eminent man once 
made the remark that 'nobody ever 
pented having eaten too little.'' 
A!'I you desire 
peace of mind 
and poral happiness, preserve your health.
