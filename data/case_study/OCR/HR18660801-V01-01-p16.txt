think no one 
will hnve reason to complain of the 
present number of The Heu.Ith Reformer. 
Its nea,t and-tasty typographical appeamnce wi compare favorably wilh a11y magazine issued in the Cnited States. The articles are replete with good instructions from the pens of careful writers 
and aounu reasoners. Y ot there 
are sowe \'antagea und.er which we 11ccessarily labor in 
suing a first number. An 
increased subscription list, and 
more exte11sive correspondence, will 
call in many 
things which will a,l<l gren.tly to the 
terest of our Journal. WI.tile therefore we shall endeavor to have future numbers 118 well filled 
with good inst-ructivc matter as the pre.~cnt, we shall tiim to present 
a still gPei.ter variety. .116,"' LAT>:. Disnppointment in obtaining teri1<l for the lteformer from the type

tho field of 
Health Reform, to 
opcrnt.c against nny other Health Institution, to underrate the efforts of any other class of heallh reformers, or to ilecry other 
Health J"ournn.la. The field. is large, n,nd there is room for all the effort 
that is likely to be put 
forth in this direction for some time to come. 
All therefore, who 
arc laboring to mitigo.te the 
evils that result from the pr<Jsent 
preni.lent false habits of life, 
we bid Gou speed in their noble work, im,l hope by our efforts, to aid somewhat in the much-needed labor in this direction.

water, so tliat thorough cooking, by boiling of 
infected pork, is a.U thot is required lo render 
it h&rmless. This reminds The 
Hartford Press of the 
old lady'H o.clvice, "Alwo.ys eat your chestnuts biled, ruy son, biled worms don't never hurt nobody."

must labor m the cause of virtue during the
