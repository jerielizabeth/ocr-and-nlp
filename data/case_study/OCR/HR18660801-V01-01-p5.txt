is to over-labor. 
Health. No. 
1. BY ELD. D. 
T. BOURDEAU. "Bclooed, I wish above all things that thou 
est prosper and be 
in heulth, e.-en us thy 9oul pereth.' 3 John 2. From this text and 
trom other 
tures of similar import,, it is apparent that 
health is a blessing of sufficient 
tance and magnitude to be 
espccblly ticed by inspiration, and to be designed for 
man's enjoyment. 
It is evident that God's 
original design 
was that man should 
joy this rich 
blessing. Yet it is a 
able fa.ct, too plain to be denied, that it 
is possessed but by 
few, and only to 
a limited extent; that 
disease and suffering 
are seen and felt everywhere, bringing 
misery and 
death to the human family. 
And how have these evils been brought 
about? Can they be mitigated? 
Can we enjoy the rich 
blessing of health? 
and if so, how? 
In reply to these question;; we would 
say, l. These evils do not spring from the 
dust, or without cause ; but sickness 
and death come by sin. But, 2. 
\Ve believe that disease can, as 
a general thing, be 
mitigated, and often healed; 
though it cannot be expected that 
it will be 
cated from the earth until the 
curse is . wiped away. 3. 
"\Ve also believe that we 
can have health, if disease 
has not taken too strong hold on our 
Rystcms. The Rick, as a ge11eral thing, 
can improve their 
healtl1 and add to their life 
; and those 
who are well can also have better health, 
and C[ln, hy pursuing a certain course, aYoid many diseases that they would 
erwise be subject to, and 
le1igthen their days. 4. As to how we can 
have health, we would say, Certainly not 
by iag in sin. For if 
we were to 
get health by ptmming the course 
by which disea~e comes, then would God be represented as 
a changeable being, ~in would be ble, and Satan wouM rule in spite of 
the Almigl1ty. Disease comes by sin, which is 
the transgression of the law of God; 
fore if we would avoid disease we must avoid transgressing God's law. But iu avoiding disease we pursue .a course to 
promote health, 
and to avoid 
ion we must keep the law of God; 
quently in 
keeping the law of God 
we wi!l enjoy health. W"ith tliis view of tl1e 
subject, we can undcrf<tand how the Lord could promise 
health to his ancient 
ple for keeping his holy law; 
nud that disease wonk! follow their violation of 
this law. Of course, God could 
add his special blessing and his 
dreadful curse to 
his people according as they 
obeyed or disobcvcd his law. The.law of God 
makes it obligatory upon U8 to care for our lives 
arnl health. This law may be called the 
law of lift>, not merely from the consideration 
tl1at lifo is bestowed for keeping it, bnt 
also because it is so 
adn.vtcd to tl1e wants of our nature,, that by kc<'ping it we will, as n natural consequence, live longer than 
we would by breaking it. Let 
tl1e reader rend each of the 
t,_Łn commandments with reference to this point, and 
see if our sertion is not-correct. But the 
sixth mandrnent, in particular, 
regulates 0111· course with regard to preservmg life nnd health. It is one of 
the negative precepts, and not only prohibits the 
sin of ing our lives 
:mu the Ii ves of others, 
but it includes 
the injunction of 
the contrary duty, -viz., to make 
use of all proper 
::ind available means to 
ameliorate and serve health, 
and prolong our existence 
and the existence of 
others. Health is the 
result of obedience to 
the laws of our being, which 
grow out of 
thP law of God, and 
disease is the J'CSlllt of the violation of the 
same laws. Gou has clothed these 
laws with ten-fold authority; 
first the health and happiness
