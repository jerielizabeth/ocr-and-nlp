Parents should ponder well on the 
ger of an 
early and cap1;cious indulgence of the appetites and imaginary wants of 
thl~ir children. Repetition soon becomes 
a bahit, and 11 habit once formed, even in 
childhood, will often remain during the 
whole of after 
life, acquiring strength evŁ ery year, until, at last, it 
sets all laws man au(l divine, at defiance. Let 
parents who yield to the cries of their children for 
dainty and promiscuous food, or 
who al· low them to torment domestic 
animals, or to strike their nurses, or to 
raise the hand 
again~t any person, consider well on the consequences. The 
moral effects of 
pering the appetites of children 
arc most melancholy. Is the mother 
afraid of an explosion of 
passion, a bribe is too often 
promised iu 
the shape of a cake or tart, 
as a peace offering. Does it fUrnoy a whole company by its 
boisterous or timed pranks, it is persuaded to be quiet 
hy the 
promise of some 
sweet-meats. If it has been good, as the 
phra~e is, the ward is still too frequently something for 
the stomach. Eating is soon 
rE,gimled as the chief end 
and object oflife by 
a child, who sees in it the chief 
inccmth'e to goo<l 
bel1avi~r. A premium would trnly 
seem to be 
given for gluttouy. The use of the 
other nohlcr senses, 
and of the 
faculties of the mind, the 
early culth-ation of the 
kindlier and better feelings of our nature 
-:-generosity, disinterestcduess, pity, 
hal love-all overcome or postponed in 
favor of the one sensual, selfish 
autl sorbing act of gormandizing. 
Mastication of Food. 
. Mastication, or c~ewi:ig, is the first step 
in the proce~s of d1gcst101i. '\Vhcn food is taken, 
it should be thoroughly ted beforn it is 
suffered to pass into the 
stomach. '\Yithout chewing, the food is 
too coar8c aud gross 
for the stomach, 
and !s _unprepar~d for ~he actio~ of the gastric 
JIHCC. Besides tins, the act10n of chewing 
causes the food to be mixed with the 
liYa, which is 
an important item 
in the preparation of it for 
the action of the 
throat in swallowing. The food 
should therefore be finely broken up, 
:mcl oughly moistened with 
salirn. In order to accomplish this end, it is 
highly nee-essary that food shouhl be taken with 
sufficient moderation to give time for 
the process of mastication, 
and the eharge of s:iJiva from the 
glands of tho mouth. Eating 
fast, or even talking 
\\·hile chewing, besides its 
incongruity with politeness 
and good breeding, 
·is rectly at 
war with thorough 
mastication. l\fony persons seem to tl1111k 
that rying their meals to 
save time, is my; their hu~iness drives tl1ern, and they drive their time of 
meals into the smallest 
possible compass. This is miserable omy; for when 
they hurry dow11 their 
food, half chewed and half moistened with 
snliva, it deranges the process of 
tion throughout; and, as a 
consequence, the food not only sets 
bad on the 
ach, and in time causes 
dyspepsia, but it 
fails to 
accomplish the sole object of 
ing it-the 
nourishment of the body. In 
ordel· to derive nom;shmeut from food, it 
must be 
well digested; hence it must be 
well masticated. 
'\Vhen, therefore, we hurry our eating, we hasten our steps on 
the wrong road. Time 
curtailed in 
ing, is worse 
than hiriug money 
at thrco per c<:nt. a month. If we cannot spare 
time to eat, we 
had better not eat 
at all. 'l'his idea c:innot be too deeply ed ; 
thousands, by this 
kind of careless, 
reckless eating, have 
foun<l themselves the Yictims of dyspepsia :md all its 
tendant train of 
eYils. The digesthŁe gans may bear the abuse a while without 
giving many signs of trouble; but the 
pemJlty of that broken 
law must, sooner 
or later, come; 
and it may come in the 
form of a broken constitution. LucK.-Some young men talk about luck Good luck 
is to get 
up at 6 o'clock in the morning; 
good luck, if you have 
only q, shilling a week, is to 
live upon 
en pence and save a penny ; good luck is 
to trouble 
your head.with your own ness, aud let your neighbor's alone; good luck iti to fulfill the ten commandments, 
and to do unto people 
as we wish them to do unto 
us. They must not only work, 
but wait. They must plod and persevere. Pence must be taken 
care of, for they are 
the seeds of guineas. 
To get along in the 
world, they mu8t take care of home, sweep 
their own 
door-ways, try to help other 
people, avoid temptation, and l1ave faith in truth 
and God. Patients should cultivate patience .
