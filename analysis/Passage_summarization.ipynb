       "'THE HEALTH REFORMER Editorial. To the Reader. BY H. S. LAY M.D. In coming for the first time before the public as an editor of a Health Reform Journal it may be expected that we say a word to our readers in reference to what we intend to do and what we design shall be the style and character of the periodical of which we have been placed in charge. Knowing something of the great responsibilities that will be thrown upon us by this new position it would be with some misgivings that we engage in this enterprise were it not for our ardent desire to do all that lies in our power to instruct and benefit the people in relation to the right method of living and if we do not also expect the hearty co operation of those who have the health and well being of the people at heart. It shall be our great object to lay before our readers the facts of vital importance in relation to the health reform and aim to instruct the people how to avoid sickness or if sick how to regain their health and that without poisons. It shall be our constant aim to make the HEALTH REFORMER worthy the patronage of an intelligent and candid public. Its contributors will be persons of experience and of high mental and moral attainments. Its selections will be of the choicest kind. We also design to devote a limited space in each number to the answering of questions proposed by our readers relative to home treatment c. which will be worth more than the price of the Journal. Not only will the reading matter be of a high order but the paper and type will be of the nicest quality. In a word we intend to make it a first class Health Journal one that will commend itself to the good judgement of an intelligent public. And now what we ask of all who receive this number is that they will do all they can to obtain subscriptions for this Journal and to increase its circulation. Sickness has come to be the ruling condition of mankind and health the exception and a better state of things cannot be expected until the laws of life and health are better understood and obeyed. These laws we shall endeavor faithfully to explain and shall inculcate a strict and intelligent obedience thereto. The subject of Health is not a denominational subject. All classes and all parties are equally interested in it. While therefore we shall advocate the proper care of our bodies or the preservation of health from a religious standpoint that is as a moral duty it will not be from a denominational one but what we may have to say will be adapted to the cases and necessities of all classes. To all therefore to whom these introductory remarks may come we extend the friendly hand and say Give us your patronage and we will endeavor to impart to you some principles of the science of healthful living and value of which is not to be estimated in dollars and cents. No Change of Diet Required. BY ELD. R. F. COTTRELL. There is the highest commendation of medicines to the people of the present age. Hence it is an inducement to quacks to recommend their nostrums in this way. If the people can hope to be cured of their maladies by swallowing a drug and at the same time continue to violate the laws of their being by swallowing all the varieties of unwholesome and deleterious articles of diet that have brought their sickness upon them it is accounted a fine thing. Gluttons are the last sort of people who want to starve to death. They wish to make no change from their self destructive way of living. They will have their baneful luxuries live or die hence they patronize the medicine labeled No Change of Diet Required. The poet Pope was right in his description of the rulling passion of the glutton. I give his description changed a little to suit our own times and to make it intelligible to the reader A feast of swine s flesh glutton was thy fate The doctor calls declares all help too late. Mercy! cries glutton mercy on my soul! Is there no hope? Alas! The bring the jole!'"

Mark the sweet reward of Heaven When Satan took his flight Angels to minister were given With consolation bright. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works. To those who are willing to obey the teachings of his word he has promised the Spirit to guide them into all truth. That this Commandment requires men to remember and to keep holy the rest day of the Creator which he hallowed at the close of the first week of time none can deny. If they cannot present such a text will they give us one which testifies that God ever blessed and sanctified the first day of the week ? The Bible thoroughly furnishes the man of God unto all good works. Sunday keepers are compelled to admit that he never did say it. Then redemption is through the death of the Lord Jesus consequently the day on which he shed his precious blood to redeem us and said It is finished John is the day that should be kept as a memorial of redemption if any should be observed for that purpose. It needs but a word to prove that in this respect it is far exceeded by the day of the crucifixion. But if we would commemorate redemption there is no necessity of robbing the Lord s rest day of its holiness in order to do it. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said Take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord s death till he come. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. But to show the utter absurdity of this inference listen to a few facts. And they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them. John says Then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them Peace be unto you. It is a fact therefore that the disciples were not commemorating the resurrection of the Saviour it is equally evident that they had not the slightest idea of a change of the Sabbath. Therefore the first day of the week should be observed instead of the Sabbath of the Lord. A period of ten days after his ascension on Thursday would include two first days the last of which\n",

Did this work of the Messiah in rendering perfect obedience to all the law of God and then offering up himself as a ransom for its transgressors weaken that law or lessen our obligation to obey it?

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works. The design of its Author in providing such a book was that the man of God might there by be made perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

The own signature and these we may observe met with his disciples again. But will they not give us which also I delivered unto you that the single particle of proof that that day had become one text in which men are required to keep Lord Jesus the same night in which he was the Sabbath of the Lord. For as often as came to pass about an eight days after these ing be a very good work when the Bible has ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do sayings he took Peter and John and James never said anything in its favor ? c. Then after six days is about eight is a good work can men be very thoroughly . . You need not that Sunday has taken the place of the Lord s good work must it not be a fearful sin keep the first day of the week. There is no such term as Christian But there are several reasons urged for the observance of the first day of the week which fore we are buried with him by baptism into Sabbath found in the Bible. Redemption is greater than even so we also shpuld walk in newness of Was the act of Christ in appearing to his creation therefore we ought to keep the day life. Buried with him in baptism to manifest himself to them John . But suppose that It is true that the professed church have on which he was last seen of them may not redemption is greater than creation who changed this ordinance to sprinkling so that be Sabbaths. this meeting by uniting with them John ly named the day of the week on which it Col. day of Pentecost was fifty days from the.res us and said It is finished John ity of this inference listen to a few facts.\n",

Never of Providence dare to complain Sunshine and storm both must ripen the grain Tried is the gold that the purest will shine Crushed is the vintage that yielded the wine. By the unerring word of God we wish to settle this question and this we believe can be done in the most satisfactory manner. For verily I say unto you Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Our Lord here testifies that he did not come to destroy the law or the prophets. We answer that it can only sig nify to abolish or to annul it. It is therefore certain that our Lord did not Oorne to subvert annul or destroy the law of God. If this was the object of the Saviour s mission did he not by this act do away the law set it aside and relieve us from obligation to keep its precepts? But it may be contended that to fulfill the law in the sense of our Lord s declaration accomplishes its purpose and takes it out of the way. When Christ came to fulfill the law he came to do this not for himself but in behalf of our race. The law of God stopped every mouth and showed all men sinners in the sight of God. He died the just for the unjust giving his own life a ransom for many. Did this work of the Messiah in rendering per fect obedience to all the law of God and then offer ing up himself as a ransom for its transgressors weaken that law or lessen our obligation to obey it i Never. It shows in the most striking light its per petuity and immutability.\n",

      "BY H. S. LAY M.D. In coming for the first time before the public as an editor of a Health Reform Journal it may be expected that we say a word to our readers in reference to what we intend to do and what we design shall be the style and character of the periodical of which we have been placed in charge. It shall be our constant aim to make the HEALTH REFORMER worthy the patronage of an intelligent and candid public. Not only will the reading matter be of a high order but the paper and type will be of the nicest quality. While therefore we shall advocate the proper care of our bodies or the preservation of health from a religious standpoint that is as a moral duty it will not be from a denominational one but what we may have to say will be adapted to the cases and necessities of all classes. Gluttons are the last sort of people who want to starve to death.\n",

May God bless you in learning the truths of the Bible and may you have a heart to obey the truth that you may be saved from all those things which are soon coming upon the earth and be prepared to stand before the Son of man. Each one would desire to have a law to please himself and no man s judgment is good enough to make a law that would be just right in everything. A boy writes a word of ten letters on a slate and spells it perfectly right. So if we change one commandment of the perfect law of God it makes it imperfect. They were given to point sinners forward to the death of Christ for forgiveness and when he died they could be used no longer.\n",

The tempter skilled in every art To turn from virtue s ways Found in the Saviour s guiltless heart Naught but his Maker s praise. Jesus to answer this request Quotes the inspired pages Man shall not live by bread alone God s word is life through ages. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works. As the first day of the week is now almost universally observed in the place of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment we design in this article to examine the grounds on which this observance rests. For what reason do men prefer the first day of the week to the ancient Sabbath of the Lord ? Or if it is a good work can men be very thoroughly furnished in its defense when God has said nothing in its favor ? It is not said that we have redemption through Christ s resurrection but it is said that we have redemption through the shedding of his blood. There is only one answer that can be given It was not remarkable that God should raise his Son from the dead but the act of the Father in giving his Son to die for sinners was a spectacle of redeeming love on which the universe might gaze and adore the wondrous love of God to all eternity. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord s death till he come. Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ? But to show the utter absurdity of this inference listen to a few facts. And they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them. John says Then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them Peace be unto you. It is a fact therefore that the disciples were not commemorating the resurrection of the Saviour it is equally evident that they had not the slightest idea of a change of the Sabbath. But who can be certain that after eight days means just a week? And after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John c. Now turn to Luke And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took Peter and John and James c. Then after six days is about eight days in this instance. But if after eight days means just a week how does this prove that Sunday has taken the place of the Lord s Sabbath! If so why did he next select a fishing day as the time to manifest himself to them John . Forty days from his resurrection would expire on Thursday the day of his ascension. A period of ten days after his ascension on Thursday would include two first days the last of which\n",

      "Here is the Patience of the Saints Here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus. J. N. ANDREWS R. F. COTTRELL URIAH SMITH Publishing Committee. The Earth restored to its Eden perfection and glory the final Inheritance of the Saints. Was the law of God abolished by the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ? For verily I say unto you Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. We answer that it can only signify to abolish or to annul it. Whiting renders it Think not that I am come to annul the law. But it may be contended that to fulfill the law in the sense of our Lord s declaration accomplishes its purpose and takes it out of the way. There is but one way in which this could be accomplished and that is to answer its just demands. When Christ came to fulfill the law he came to do this not for himself but in behalf of our race. The law of God stopped every mouth and showed all men sinners in the sight of God. Then when the Saviour took upon himself our nature and came to fulfill the law of his Father that l aw not only demanded perfect obedience but it also justly demanded the death of our race for all were its transgressors. The work of the Saviour therefore in fulfilling the law of his Father was of a two fold character. And this was not all he took upon himself the sin of the world. God can now be just and yet justify him that believeth in Jesus.\n",
