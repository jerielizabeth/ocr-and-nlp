       "'8     THE HEALTH REFORMER\\n\\nEditorial.\\n\\nTo the Reader.\\nBY H. S. LAY, M.D.\\n\\nIn coming for the first time before the \\npublic as an editor of a Health-Reform \\nJournal, it may be expected that we say \\na word to our readers in reference to what \\nwe intend to do, and what we design shall \\nbe the style and character of the periodical\\nof which we have been placed in charge.\\n\\nKnowing something of the great responsibilities\\nthat will be thrown upon us by \\nthis new position, it would be with some \\nmisgivings that we engage in this enterprise,\\nwere it not for our ardent desire to \\ndo all that lies in our power to instruct\\nand benefit the people in relation to the \\nright method of living; and if we do not \\nalso expect the hearty co-operation of \\nthose who have the health and well-being\\nof the people at heart. \\n\\nIt shall be our great object to lay before \\nour readers the facts of vital importance in relation \\nto the health reform, and aim to instruct \\nthe people how to avoid sickness,\\nor if sick, how to regain their health, and \\nthat without poisons. It shall be our constant\\naim to make the HEALTH REFORMER \\nworthy the patronage of an intelligent and \\ncandid public. Its contributors will be \\npersons of experience, and of high mental \\nand moral attainments. Its selections will \\nbe of the choicest kind. \\n\\nWe also design to devote a limited space \\nin each number to the answering of questions \\nproposed by our readers relative to \\nhome treatment, &c., which will be worth \\nmore than the price of the Journal.\\n\\nNot only will the reading matter be of \\na high order, but the paper and type will \\nbe of the nicest quality. In a word, we \\nintend to make it a first-class Health Journal,\\none that will commend itself to the \\ngood judgement of an intelligent public.\\n\\nAnd now what we ask of all who receive \\nthis number is, that they will do all they \\ncan to obtain subscriptions for this Journal, \\nand to increase its circulation.\\n\\nSickness has come to be the ruling condition \\nof mankind, and health the exception;\\nand a better state of things cannot \\nbe expected until the laws of life and \\nhealth are better understood and obeyed.\\nThese laws we shall endeavor faithfully to \\nexplain; and shall inculcate a strict and \\nintelligent obedience thereto. \\n\\nThe subject of Health is not a denominational \\nsubject. All classes and all parties \\nare equally interested in it. While, \\ntherefore, we shall advocate the proper \\ncare of our bodies, or the preservation of \\nhealth, from a religious standpoint, that \\nis, as a moral duty, it will not be from a \\ndenominational one; but what we may \\nhave to say will be adapted to the cases \\nand \\'necessities of all classes. To all,\\ntherefore, to whom these introductory remarks\\nmay come, we extend the friendly \\nhand, and say, Give us your patronage,\\nand we will endeavor to impart to you \\nsome principles of the science of healthful \\nliving, and value of which is not to be estimated\\nin dollars and cents.\\n\\n\"No Change of Diet Required.\"\\nBY ELD. R. F. COTTRELL.\\n\\nThere is the highest commendation of \\nmedicines to the people of the present\\nage. Hence it is an inducement to quacks\\nto recommend their nostrums in this way. \\nIf the people can hope to be cured of \\ntheir maladies by swallowing a drug, and, \\nat the same time, continue to violate the \\nlaws of their being, by swallowing all the \\nvarieties of unwholesome and deleterious\\narticles of diet that have brought their \\nsickness upon them, it is accounted a \\nfine thing. Gluttons are the last sort of \\npeople who want to starve to death.\\nThey wish to make no change from their \\nself-destructive way of living. They will \\nhave their baneful luxuries, live or die; \\nhence they patronize the medicine labeled, \\nNo Change of Diet Required. The poet \\nPope was right in his description of the \\nrulling passion of the glutton. I give his \\ndescription, changed a little to suit our \\nown times, and to make it intelligible to \\nthe reader:\\n\\n\"A feast of swine\\'s flesh, glutton was thy fate, \\nThe doctor calls, declares all help too late. \\n\\'Mercy!\\' cries glutton, \\'mercy on my soul!\\nIs there no hope? Alas! The bring the jole!\"'"

Ascending to a mountain's top, All nations in their view, \"Now worship me,\" the tempter said, \" All these I give to you.\" \" Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" It needs but a word to make this clear : \" He appeared in an mandment which it is said has been changed : prove that, in this respect, it is far exceeded other form unto two of them, as they walked, \" Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it by the day of the crucifixion. with their unbelief and hardness of heart, be daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid There is only one answer that can be given : cause they believed not them which had seen servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that It was not remarkable that God should raise him after he was risen.\" returned and prepared spices and ointments on that authority alone, they are perfectly But if we would commemorate redemption, to embalm him ; the Sabbath drew on ; they satisfied in observing the first day of the there is no necessity of robbing the Lord's rested the Sabbath day, according to the corn week. , You which is thereby proved to be the Christian give us one which testifies that God ever need not keep the day of his crucifixion. ped, saying, This cup is the New Testament days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John,\" The Bible thoroughly furnishes the man of in my blood : This do ye, as oft as ye drink &c.

Y. 109 Mon roe Street, post paid. The Law of God, as taught in the Old and NOW Testaments, unchangeable. Never of Providence dare to complain; Sunshine and storm both must ripen the grain; Tried is the gold that the purest will shine ; Crushed is the vintage that yielded; the wine. This com mandment stands in the midst of nine moral pre cepts which Jehovah, after uttering with his own voice, wrote with his own finger on the tables of stone. This was not the morallaw of God; butwasir merely the shadow of good thingsto come. For verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. And thus Campbell renders the word : \" Think not that I am come to subvert the law.\" Hence it follows thatthe law of God WAS not annulled or abrogated by him. If this was the object of the Saviour's mission, did he not by this act do away the law, set it aside, and relieve us from obligation to keep its precepts? When John refused to baptize the Saviour, Jesus said, \"Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\" There is but one way in which this could be accom plished, and that is to answer its just demands. To fulfill the law as the Messiah, Christ must perform all this. And this was not all ; he took upon himself the sin of the world. He could not destroy his own mor al law; but he could give his own beloved and on ly Son to die for its transgressors.\n",

      "When Satan took his flight; \n",
      "Angels to minister were given, \n",
      "With consolation bright. On what authority do men continually violate \n",
      "the day which God sanctified, and commanded \n",
      "mankind to keep holy! Here is the commandment \n",
      "which it is said has been changed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it \n",
      "holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all \n",
      "thy work ; but the seventh day is the Sabbath \n",
      "of the Lord thy God ; in it thou shalt \n",
      "not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy \n",
      "daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maidservant,\n",
      "nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \n",
      "is within thy gates ; for in six days the Lord \n",
      "made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that \n",
      "in them is, and rested the seventh day ; wherefore \n",
      "the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and  \n",
      "hallowed it.\" Instead of being a\n",
      "good work, must it not be a fearful sin  \n",
      "against God to thus pervert the fourth commandment, \n",
      "when once the mind has been enlightened \n",
      "on the subject ? But there are several reasons urged for the \n",
      "observance of the first day of the week, which \n",
      "we will here notice. Sunday-keepers \n",
      "are compelled to admit that he never did say \n",
      "it. In whom we have redemption\n",
      "through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,  \n",
      "according to the riches of his grace.\" Who can \n",
      "wonder that the sun was vailed in darkness, \n",
      "and that all nature trembled at the sight ! Buried with him in baptism, \n",
      "wherein also ye are risen with him through \n",
      "the faith of the operation of God, who hath \n",
      "raised him from the dead.\" And that they may add  \n",
      "sin to sin, they lay hold of the Lord's Sabbath \n",
      "and change it to the first day of the  \n",
      "week, thus destroying the sacred memorial of \n",
      "the Creator's rest, that they may have a memorial \n",
      "of Christ's resurrection ! \" When will the professed church \n",
      "cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ? John says : \" Then the same day at evening, \n",
      "being the first day of the week, when the \n",
      "doors were shut where the disciples were assembled \n",
      "for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and \n",
      "stood in the midst, and saith unto them, \n",
      "Peace be unto you.\" It is a fact, therefore, that the disciples \n",
      "were not commemorating the resurrection of \n",
      "the Saviour ; it is equally evident that they \n",
      "had not the slightest idea of a change of the \n",
      "Sabbath. Were it certain that this occurred on the \n",
      "first day of the week, it would not furnish a \n",
      "single particle of proof that that day had become \n",
      "the Sabbath of the Lord. It would be nearer a literal construction \n",
      "of the language to conclude that this \n",
      "was upon the ninth day. Therefore,\n",
      "the first day of the week should be observed \n",
      "instead of the Sabbath of the Lord. Admitting that the day ' of Pentecost occurred \n",
      "upon the first day of the week, it remains \n",
      "to be proved that it thereby became \n",
      "the Sabbath.\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the Patience of the Saints, Here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus.\" All communications, orders, and remittances should be \n",
      "addressed \n",
      "to JAMES WHITE Rochester, N. Y. 109 Monroe \n",
      "Street, (post-paid.) The Law of God, as taught in the Old and New  Testaments, unchangeable. Immortality alone through Christ, to be given to the Saints \n",
      "at the Resurrection. \"All things work together for good to them that love God\" \n",
      "\n",
      "THROUGH this dark \"valley of conflict\" and sin, \n",
      "Trials without and temptations within, \n",
      "Onward to glory, still urge thy lone way, \n",
      "Joyful in hope of the long-promised day. In every danger thou host a sure guide; \n",
      "To every cloud there is yet a bright side; Falter then not at the sternest behest, \n",
      "Ever remember-'tis all for the best! If the law of God has been destroyed, \n",
      "the act must have been accomplished by one of three \n",
      "things; viz., For verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and \n",
      "earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass \n",
      "from the law, till all be fulfilled. And thus Campbell \n",
      "renders the word:- \"Think not that I am come to \n",
      "subvert the law.\" If this was the object of the Saviour's \n",
      "mission, did he not by this act do away the law, set \n",
      "it aside, and relieve us from obligation to keep its \n",
      "precepts? As Campbell renders the \n",
      "text, it reads, \"1 am not come to subvert, but to ratify.\" But it may be contended that to fulfill the law in \n",
      "the sense of our Lord's declaration, accomplishes its \n",
      "purpose, and takes it out of the way. When John refused to baptize the Saviour, Jesus \n",
      "said, \"Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh \n",
      "us to fulfill all righteousness.\" And this was not all; \n",
      "he took upon himself the sin of the world. Isaiah predicted that Christ should magnify the law, \n",
      "and make it honorable.\n",

For what reason do men prefer the first day of the week to the ancient Sabbath of the Lord ?

Ascending to a mountain's top, All nations in their view, \"Now worship me,\" the tempter said, \" All these I give to you.\" \" Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" It needs but a word to make this clear : \" He appeared in an mandment which it is said has been changed : prove that, in this respect, it is far exceeded other form unto two of them, as they walked, \" Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it by the day of the crucifixion. with their unbelief and hardness of heart, be daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid There is only one answer that can be given : cause they believed not them which had seen servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that It was not remarkable that God should raise him after he was risen.\" returned and prepared spices and ointments on that authority alone, they are perfectly But if we would commemorate redemption, to embalm him ; the Sabbath drew on ; they satisfied in observing the first day of the there is no necessity of robbing the Lord's rested the Sabbath day, according to the corn week. , You which is thereby proved to be the Christian give us one which testifies that God ever need not keep the day of his crucifixion. ped, saying, This cup is the New Testament days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John,\" The Bible thoroughly furnishes the man of in my blood : This do ye, as oft as ye drink &c.

Never of Providence dare to complain; Sunshine and storm both must ripen the grain; Tried is the gold that the purest will shine ; Crushed is the vintage that yielded; the wine. This com mandment stands in the midst of nine moral pre cepts which Jehovah, after uttering with his own voice, wrote with his own finger on the tables of stone. This was not the morallaw of God; butwasir merely the shadow of good thingsto come. For verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. And thus Campbell renders the word : \" Think not that I am come to subvert the law.\" Hence it follows thatthe law of God WAS not annulled or abrogated by him. If this was the object of the Saviour's mission, did he not by this act do away the law, set it aside, and relieve us from obligation to keep its precepts? When John refused to baptize the Saviour, Jesus said, \"Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\" There is but one way in which this could be accom plished, and that is to answer its just demands. To fulfill the law as the Messiah, Christ must perform all this. And this was not all ; he took upon himself the sin of the world. He could not destroy his own mor al law; but he could give his own beloved and on ly Son to die for its transgressors.\n",
